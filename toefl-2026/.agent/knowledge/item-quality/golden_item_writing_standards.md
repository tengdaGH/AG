# ETS TOEFL 2026: Golden Standards for Item Writers

> **From:** ETS Test Development Supervisors
> **To:** TOEFL 2026 Item Writers
> **Subject:** Golden Standards for Generation and Construction of TOEFL 2026 Items
> **Version:** 2026.1 (Official)

This document serves as the **Golden Standard** for generating test items for the TOEFL 2026 redesign. While our QA documents focus on *reviewing* items (e.g., `mcq_item_quality.md`), this manual provides the generative scaffolding. As an item writer, your goal is to construct items that are authentic, fair, psychometrically sound, and perfectly aligned with the target CEFR level (A1-C2).

## Part 1: General Generation Philosophy
1. **Construct Relevance over Complexity:** Do not use convoluted syntax or obscure vocabulary to make an item "hard." Difficulty must come from the cognitive task (e.g., synthesizing two conflicting ideas) rather than deciphering deliberately tricky prose.
2. **Authenticity:** Texts and audio scripts must sound like English as it is actually used in 2026. Remove outdated idioms. Use standard conventions of academic and daily discourse.
3. **Plausibility:** In MCQ writing, distractors must represent genuine learner errors (e.g., misunderstanding a transition word, over-generalizing), not random facts dropped into the option.
4. **Bias & Sensitivity Adherence:** All stimuli must be universally accessible. Avoid region-specific mechanics (e.g., US local tax codes, culturally specific college fraternities) that provide unfair background advantages.

## Part 2: Reading Section Standards

### 2.1 Read an Academic Passage
*   **Topic Selection:** Source material must be adapted from university-level introductory texts (Biology, History, Arts, Social Sciences). Do not write "encyclopedia" articles; write "textbook" passages that explain a phenomenon, describe a historical sequence, or compare two theories.
*   **Text Structure (300-400 words):** 
    *   **Paragraph 1:** Hook, definition of the core concept, thesis.
    *   **Paragraph 2 & 3:** Supporting evidence, chronological steps, or contrasting perspectives. Uses clear discourse markers ("Consequently," "In contrast").
    *   **Paragraph 4:** Conclusion or modern implications.
*   **Writing the Key & Distractors:** The correct answer must require reading the text. For distractors, use the "Plausible Misinterpretation" technique—use words adjacent to the correct answer in the text, but twist the logic (e.g., swapping cause and effect).

### 2.2 Read in Daily Life
*   **Format:** Must mimic real-world documents exactly (e.g., a university library fine notice, a syllabus excerpt, an email from a landlord). It should contain bullet points, headers, or bolded terms if appropriate.
*   **The Task:** Questions must test scanning and detail retrieval (CEFR B1/B2 level). "What is the penalty for a late submission after 48 hours?"
*   **Distractor Generation:** Distractors should be other numbers/dates/policies mentioned in the text that answer a *different* question.

### 2.3 Complete the Words (Cloze)
*   **Targeting:** Create a 100-150 word text. The blank should test lexical collocation or grammatical cohesion, not obscure trivia. 
*   **Pacing:** The first and last sentences of the text MUST remain intact to provide context. Never put a blank on the first line. 
*   **Distractor Generation (if applicable):** If providing a word bank, all words must be of the same grammatical category (e.g., all transitive verbs) to prevent test-takers from guessing based purely on syntax without understanding meaning.

## Part 3: Listening Section Standards

### 3.1 Listen to an Academic Talk
*   **Scripting the Lecture:** This must sound *spoken*, not read. 
    *   *Do use:* Discourse markers ("Now, let's move on to...", "But here's the interesting part..."), rhetorical questions, and slight verbal pivots ("Well, actually...").
    *   *Length:* 175–250 words (~2 minutes spoken).
*   **Information Density:** Do not pack lists of facts. Focus on one core concept and two examples/sub-topics.
*   **Question Generation:** Always include a "Gist/Main Purpose" question and an "Inference/Implication" question.

### 3.2 Listen to a Conversation
*   **The Scenario:** Must feature two speakers (e.g., Student A and Student B, or Student and Professor/Staff). Problem-resolution format is golden.
*   **Pacing:** Turn-taking should be natural. A speaker shouldn't talk for more than 4-5 sentences without the other speaker reacting or clarifying.
*   **Pragmatics:** Test the *intent* of the speaker. Write questions like, "Why does the professor say: *'Are you sure you've checked the online portal?'*"

### 3.3 Listen to an Announcement
*   **Tone & Delivery:** Authoritative, concise, single speaker (e.g., a campus PA system, a professor at the start of class).
*   **Structure (100-150 words):** 
    1. The update/change (e.g., "The library will close early...").
    2. The reason ("...due to emergency maintenance.").
    3. The alternative/instruction ("...please use the study hall in building B.").

### 3.4 Listen and Choose a Response
*   **The Prompt:** Write a 1-2 sentence social or academic prompt that sets a clear pragmatic context ("I'm completely stuck on this research paper, and it's due Friday.")
*   **The Options:** 
    *   **Key:** Natural, empathetic, or solution-oriented ("Have you tried visiting the writing center?").
    *   **Distractors:** Pragmatic failures. A response that uses the same vocabulary but misunderstands the context, a socially inappropriate response, or an overly formal/robotic response.

## Part 4: Speaking Section Standards

### 4.1 Listen and Repeat
*   **Length & Complexity:** 8 to 15 words. Must be a single, grammatically complete sentence.
*   **Phonological Targets:** Sentences should naturally elicit common English rhythm (stress-timing) and intonation contours (e.g., a list of three items, a conditional clause). 
    *   *Example:* "If you need an extension, please email the professor before Friday." (Tests conditional rhythm and pacing).
*   **Avoid:** Highly technical jargon or names that test-takers might stumble over due to unfamiliarity rather than phonetic inability.

### 4.2 Take an Interview
*   **Prompt Design:** Open-ended questions that do not require specialized knowledge. Topics should relate to student life, personal preferences, or general society.
*   **Depth:** The question should naturally require a multi-sentence answer (e.g., not just "Yes/No", but "Which do you prefer and why?").
*   **Follow-Up Scripts:** Write realistic, conversational follow-up questions for the simulated interviewer. If the initial prompt is "Do you prefer online or in-person classes?", the follow-up could be "How does that affect your ability to focus?"

## Part 5: Writing Section Standards

### 5.1 Build a Sentence
*   **Deconstruction:** Start with a perfectly grammatical target sentence testing a specific structural rule (e.g., relative clauses, adjective ordering, inversion).
*   **Chunking (The Word Tiles):** Break the sentence into 4-7 chunks. Do NOT break chunks in ways that create ambiguous grammatical alternatives. There must be *only one* correct way to reassemble them.
    *   *Good Chunking:* `[The committee]` `[has decided]` `[to postpone]` `[the meeting]` `[until next week.]`
    *   *Bad Chunking:* Breaking it up so much that the test taker can legally form a different sentence.

### 5.2 Write an Email
*   **The Scenario:** A transactional, goal-oriented task. The prompt must explicitly state the relationship (e.g., student to professor, employee to manager) and the goal (e.g., ask for a deadline extension and propose a new date).
*   **Clarity of Constraints:** Make sure the prompt lists exactly 2-3 pieces of information the test-taker MUST include. "Your email must: 1. Apologize for the delay. 2. Explain the reason. 3. Suggest a new time to meet."

### 5.3 Write an Academic Discussion
*   **The Topic:** A perennial, accessible academic or social debate (e.g., "Should governments fund space exploration or focus on Earth's problems?").
*   **Professor's Prompt:** Frame the debate clearly. Set the stage for why this is being discussed.
*   **Student Models:**
    *   *Student 1:* Takes Position A. Writes 2-3 sentences of B2/C1 level justification.
    *   *Student 2:* Takes Position B. Acknowledges Student 1's point, but pivots to their own justification.
    *   *Generative Rule:* The student models must leave room for the test-taker. Do not let the student models use up all the best arguments.

> **Supervisor's Final Note:**
> Remember, an ETS item is a scientific instrument. It must measure exactly what it claims to measure, without interference from poor wording, confusing layouts, or artificial difficulty. Write with precision.
