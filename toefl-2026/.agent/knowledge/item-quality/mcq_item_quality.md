This document is the **single authoritative reference** for what constitutes a bulletproof multiple-choice question in the TOEFL 2026 item bank. All agents generating, reviewing, or remediating MCQ items MUST follow these standards.

## 1. Stem Standards

The **stem** is the question or incomplete statement that defines the test-taker's task.

### Hard Rules (violations → FAIL)
- **Single problem**: The stem must address exactly one concept or task. No compound questions.
- **Completeness**: The stem must contain all information needed to understand what is being asked — test-takers should not need to read the options to understand the question.
- **No grammatical leakage**: The stem must not provide grammar clues to the correct answer (e.g., "an ___" that only one option begins with a vowel).

### Soft Rules (violations → NOTE)
- **Positive phrasing preferred**: Avoid negative phrasing ("NOT", "EXCEPT"). If used, these words MUST appear in ALL CAPS in the stem.
- **Avoid vague openers**: Do not begin with "Which of the following is true?" or "Which of the following is false?" — these are construct-invalid forms.
- **No absolutes in stem**: Avoid "always", "never", "only", "must" — they create test-wiseness shortcuts.
- **Vocabulary question format**: For vocabulary-in-context questions, the stem must quote the exact target word/phrase AND cite where it appears (e.g., "paragraph 1" or "line 3").

## 2. Key Standards (Correct Answer)

The **key** is the single correct or best answer.

### Hard Rules (violations → FAIL)
- **Uniqueness**: Exactly ONE option must be correct. The key must be unambiguously the best answer — another well-informed reviewer must arrive at the same choice.
- **Grounded**: For reading items, the key must be directly and unambiguously supported by content in the passage — not inference without textual basis, not external knowledge.
- **No verbatim lift**: The key must NOT reproduce 6 or more consecutive words from the passage verbatim. Paraphrase is required. (ETS standard: keys should paraphrase, not copy.)
- **Length parity (CRITICAL)**: The key must NOT exceed the mean word count of distractors by more than 50%. A long key is a construct-irrelevant cue that allows test-savvy examinees to guess without reading.

### Soft Rules (violations → NOTE)
- **No absolute words in key**: Avoid "always", "never", "only", "all", "none" — these often make the key look obviously correct or obviously wrong.
- **Comparable detail**: The key should not be measurably more specific, explanatory, or elaborated than the distractors. If the key needs qualifications the distractors lack, simplify the key or expand the distractors.

## 3. Distractor Standards (Incorrect Options)

**Distractors** are the incorrect options that attract test-takers who lack the target knowledge.

### Hard Rules (violations → FAIL)
- **No "all/none of the above"**: Forbidden in all TOEFL MCQ items (S1, S2, S3). These collapse the 4-option model's psychometric properties.
- **Plausible but wrong**: Each distractor must be clearly incorrect when checked against the passage, but must appear reasonable to a learner who misreads, over-infers, or lacks vocabulary.
- **No duplicates / overlaps**: No two distractors can mean the same thing, share a 5+ word leading phrase, or together cover the same incorrect inference.
- **No absurd distractors**: A distractor that is obviously wrong (e.g., off-topic, factually impossible) provides no diagnostic information and weakens item discrimination.

### Soft Rules (violations → NOTE)
- **No absolute words in distractors**: "Always", "never", "only" make distractors too easy to eliminate, reducing item discrimination.
- **Common misconception anchoring**: The best distractors represent predictable errors a learner makes — vocabulary confusion, over-generalization, incorrect inference from a related part of the text.
- **No clue-bearing language**: A distractor must not contain phrases or words that echo the correct part of the passage in a way that tips off the test-taker.

## 4. Option Set Standards (All 4 Options Together)

The **option set** is the full collection of A, B, C, D evaluated as a unit.

### Hard Rules (violations → FAIL)
- **Exactly 4 options**: All MCQ items in TOEFL 2026 use 4 options (A–D). No 3-option or 5-option items.
- **Option length parity**: The longest option must not exceed **2.5×** the word count of the shortest option. Outlier-length options signal the key (too long) or are absurd (too short).
- **Grammatical parallelism**: All options must complete the stem grammatically and must be parallel in structure. If options are noun phrases, all must be noun phrases. If they are full sentences, all must be full sentences.
- **Consistent capitalization**: All options begin with a capital letter. All options end with consistent punctuation (all periods, or none).

### Soft Rules (violations → NOTE)
- **Randomize key position**: The key should not consistently fall in position A or D. ETS randomizes key position across items.
- **Option length consistency**: Aim for all options to be within ±30% of each other in word count. If one option is dramatically longer, it likely needs to be trimmed or the others expanded.
- **No option echoes stem verbatim**: Each option should restate the concept in its own terms, not simply repeat words from the stem.

## 5. Question Type Coverage (Academic Passage Items)

For **Read an Academic Passage** items, each set of 5 questions must include at least one of each required type:

| Type | Required | Canonical Stem Pattern |
|------|----------|------------------------|
| Main Idea / Purpose | ✅ Required | "What is the passage mainly about?" / "What is the main purpose of the passage?" |
| Factual Detail | ✅ Required | "According to the passage, …" |
| Inference | ✅ Required | "What can be inferred …" / "What does the passage suggest …" |
| Vocabulary in Context | ✅ Required | "The word '[X]' in paragraph N is closest in meaning to …" |
| Rhetorical Purpose | ✅ Required | "The author mentions [X] in order to …" / "Why does the author …" |

Missing any required type → ⚠️ NOTE (deduct from Quality Score).

## 6. Quality Score Formula

Each item receives a **Quality Score from 0–100** used to prioritize remediation.

| Check | Penalty if violated |
|-------|---------------------|
| Key length dominance (>50% longer than mean distractor) | −25 |
| Option length parity (longest > 2.5× shortest) | −20 |
| Any FAIL-level check (no correct answer, duplicate options, <4 options, "all/none of above") | −20 per violation |
| Absolute word in key | −5 |
| Absolute word in distractor | −3 per distractor |
| Verbatim lift from passage in key (≥6 words) | −10 |
| Missing required question type | −5 per missing type |
| Negative phrasing in stem without ALL CAPS | −5 |
| Vague opener ("Which of the following is true?") | −5 |

**Score bands**:
- 100–85: ✅ PASS — publish-ready
- 84–70: ⚠️ NOTES — minor polish recommended before publishing
- 69–0: ❌ FAIL — requires remediation before use

## 7. Remediation Guidelines

When an item fails, use these remediation strategies before regenerating:

| Issue | Remediation |
|-------|-------------|
| Key too long | Trim the key to its core claim. Remove qualifications/examples that aren't needed for disambiguation. |
| Short distractors | Expand each distractor to match the key's level of specificity — add a plausible but wrong qualifier. |
| Option length parity failure | Identify the shortest option. Expand it by adding a plausible clause. Or shorten the longest. |
| Verbatim lift in key | Replace 3+ consecutive passage words with synonyms/paraphrases. |
| Absolute word in key | Replace "always/never/only" with "typically/rarely/primarily". |
| Plausible-but-obvious distractor | Rewrite using a common misconception rather than an extreme or off-topic claim. |
| Missing question type | Add a new question of the missing type. If at 5 questions, replace the weakest existing question. |
