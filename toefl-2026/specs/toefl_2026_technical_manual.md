| Stage 2 Lower | 0 |
| Stage 2 Upper | 8 |
| Easy path total | 4 |
| Hard path total | 12 |

## Example

**Academic talk transcript** (~200 words):

"Did you see that new thriller movie that came out last week? I did and loved it. The action, the plot twists… I was totally captivated. Time just flew by. Not a single thought occurred to me that was unrelated to the movie. What I experienced is what psychologists call hard fascination. Hard fascination means intense focus and concentration. Whether it's TV programs, video games... hard fascination is all too easy to come by in this modern world.

There's another type of fascination — soft fascination. There's still effortless attention, meaning that no special effort is required for you to stay focused, but there's still room for other thoughts. When I take a walk in the park and look at the flowers and trees, for example, I might be thinking in the back of my mind about my dinner plans.

Now, one thing to know is hard fascination causes mental fatigue. The mind is so intensely focused that it gets tired fast. What follows mental fatigue? You might find yourself easily distracted, irritable, and stressed. Soft fascination, in contrast, engages a different part of the brain — the DMN, or Default Mode Network, which soothes the mind and helps combat mental fatigue. So next time you feel like your mind is on overload, turn off the TV, put down your phone. Take a walk, or simply sit and stare at the clouds."

- Pronunciation is easily intelligible; rhythm and intonation effectively convey meaning
- A range of accurate grammar and vocabulary allows clear expression of precise meanings

## Score 4 — Typical Features
- The response is on topic and elaborated, but may lack effective sentence-level connectors
- Good speaking pace is generally maintained, with some pausing that may minimally affect flow
- Intelligibility and meaning are not impeded by pronunciation, rhythm and intonation, although occasional words/phrases may require minor effort to understand
- Grammar and vocabulary are adequate to express general meanings most of the time

## Score 3 — Typical Features
- The response is generally on topic, but elaboration may be relatively limited
- Frequent or lengthy pauses result in a choppy pace; filler words are frequent
- Intelligibility is sometimes affected by inaccuracies in word-level pronunciation or stress/rhythm
- Limited range and accuracy of grammar and vocabulary noticeably restrict the precision and clarity of meanings

## Score 2 — Typical Features
- The response is minimally connected to the interviewer's question, but has little or no relevant elaboration or consists mainly of language from the question

# Listen and Repeat — Scoring Rubric

> Source: TOEFL iBT® Technical Manual, Figure A3 (Appendix A)

| Score | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **5** | The response exactly repeats the prompt. Fully intelligible and an exact repetition. |
| **4** | Captures the meaning but is not an exact repetition. Minor changes that do not substantially change meaning. |
| **3** | Essentially full, but does not accurately capture the original meaning. Contains a majority of the content words/ideas. |
| **2** | Missing a significant part of the prompt and/or is highly inaccurate. Important original meaning is left out. |
| **1** | Captures very little of the prompt or is largely unintelligible. Minimal response of a few words. |
| **0** | No response, entirely unintelligible, no English, or entirely unconnected to the prompt. |

## Score 5 — Detail
- The response is fully intelligible and is an exact repetition of the prompt.

## Score 4 — Detail
Minor changes in words or grammar are present that do not substantially change the meaning. For example:
- One or two function words may be missing or changed
- A content word may be missing (in longer stimuli) or replaced with a related word
- Markers of tense/aspect/number may be missing or incorrect
- Two words may be transposed
- One or two content words may be ambiguous because of imprecise pronunciation
- The speaker may self-correct but successfully completes the response

## Score 3 — Detail
- The response contains a majority of the content words or ideas in the prompt
- Multiple function words may be changed or missing; one or more content words may be missing or substantively changed
- The response is a full sentence
- In some cases, intelligibility issues cause occasional difficulty in understanding meaning
- The speaker may struggle over a word or phrase or run words together, reducing intelligibility

## Score 2 — Detail
- A large portion of the prompt is missing, and important original meaning is left out
- The speaker may repeat the first part of the sentence, then stop or fill with inaccurate content and/or include the last few words
- The response is not a self-standing sentence; meaning is fragmentary
- Intelligibility is low; the response would be difficult to understand for a listener unfamiliar with the prompt

## Score 1 — Detail
- A minimal response of a few words is made; most of the prompt is missing
- The response is recognizable as an attempt to repeat the prompt, but it is mostly unintelligible

# Write for an Academic Discussion — Scoring Rubric

> Source: TOEFL iBT® Technical Manual, Figure A2 (Appendix A)

| Score | Level | Description |
|-------|-------|-------------|
| **5** | Fully successful | A relevant and very clearly expressed contribution to the online discussion, demonstrating consistent facility in the use of language. |
| **4** | Generally successful | A relevant contribution to the online discussion; facility in the use of language allows the writer's ideas to be easily understood. |
| **3** | Partially successful | A mostly relevant and mostly understandable contribution to the online discussion; some facility in the use of language. |
| **2** | Mostly unsuccessful | Reflects an attempt to contribute to the online discussion, but limitations in the use of language may make ideas hard to follow. |
| **1** | Unsuccessful | Reflects an ineffective attempt to contribute to the online discussion; limitations in the use of language may prevent the expression of ideas. |
| **0** | No scorable response | Blank, rejects topic, not in English, entirely copied from prompt, entirely unconnected to prompt, or arbitrary keystrokes. |

## Score 5 — Typical Features
- Relevant and well-elaborated explanations, exemplifications and/or details
- Effective use of a variety of syntactic structures and precise, idiomatic word choice
- Almost no lexical or grammatical errors other than those expected from a competent writer writing under timed conditions (e.g., common typos or substitutions like there/their)

## Score 4 — Typical Features
- Relevant and adequately elaborated explanations, exemplifications and/or details
- A variety of syntactic structures and appropriate word choice
- Few lexical or grammatical errors

## Score 3 — Typical Features
- Elaboration in which part of an explanation, example or detail may be missing, unclear or irrelevant
- Some variety in syntactic structures and a range of vocabulary
- Some noticeable lexical and grammatical errors in sentence structure, word form or use of idiomatic language

## Score 2 — Typical Features
- Ideas that may be poorly elaborated or only partially relevant
- A limited range of syntactic structures and vocabulary
- An accumulation of errors in sentence structure, word forms or use

## Score 1 — Typical Features
- Words and phrases that indicate an attempt to address the task, but with few or no coherent ideas
- Severely limited range of syntactic structures and vocabulary
- Serious and frequent errors in the use of language
- Minimal original language; any coherent language is mostly borrowed from the stimulus
