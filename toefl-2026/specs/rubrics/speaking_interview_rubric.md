## Score 5 — Typical Features
- The response is on topic and well elaborated

## Score 4 — Typical Features
- The response is on topic and elaborated, but may lack effective sentence-level connectors
- Good speaking pace is generally maintained, with some pausing that may minimally affect flow
- Intelligibility and meaning are not impeded by pronunciation, rhythm and intonation, although occasional words/phrases may require minor effort to understand
- Grammar and vocabulary are adequate to express general meanings most of the time

## Score 3 — Typical Features
