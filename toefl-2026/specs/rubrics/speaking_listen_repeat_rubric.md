> Source: TOEFL iBT® Technical Manual, Figure A3 (Appendix A)

| Score | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **5** | The response exactly repeats the prompt. Fully intelligible and an exact repetition. |
| **4** | Captures the meaning but is not an exact repetition. Minor changes that do not substantially change meaning. |
| **3** | Essentially full, but does not accurately capture the original meaning. Contains a majority of the content words/ideas. |
| **2** | Missing a significant part of the prompt and/or is highly inaccurate. Important original meaning is left out. |
| **1** | Captures very little of the prompt or is largely unintelligible. Minimal response of a few words. |
| **0** | No response, entirely unintelligible, no English, or entirely unconnected to the prompt. |

## Score 5 — Detail
- The response is fully intelligible and is an exact repetition of the prompt.

## Score 4 — Detail
Minor changes in words or grammar are present that do not substantially change the meaning. For example:
- One or two function words may be missing or changed
- A content word may be missing (in longer stimuli) or replaced with a related word
- Markers of tense/aspect/number may be missing or incorrect
- Two words may be transposed
- One or two content words may be ambiguous because of imprecise pronunciation
- The speaker may self-correct but successfully completes the response

## Score 3 — Detail
- The response contains a majority of the content words or ideas in the prompt
- Multiple function words may be changed or missing; one or more content words may be missing or substantively changed
- The response is a full sentence
- In some cases, intelligibility issues cause occasional difficulty in understanding meaning
- The speaker may struggle over a word or phrase or run words together, reducing intelligibility

## Score 2 — Detail
- A large portion of the prompt is missing, and important original meaning is left out
- The speaker may repeat the first part of the sentence, then stop or fill with inaccurate content and/or include the last few words
- The response is not a self-standing sentence; meaning is fragmentary
- Intelligibility is low; the response would be difficult to understand for a listener unfamiliar with the prompt

## Score 1 — Detail
- A minimal response of a few words is made; most of the prompt is missing
- The response is recognizable as an attempt to repeat the prompt, but it is mostly unintelligible
