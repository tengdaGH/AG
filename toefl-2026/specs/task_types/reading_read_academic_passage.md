## 3. Interaction & Delivery Mechanics
### Delivery Sequence & States
1. **Initial State (Passage Only)**: When the item first loads, only the passage is visible (full width). The user must scroll to the bottom of the passage.
2. **Interactive State (Split-Screen)**: Only after clicking "Next" from the passage-only view does the screen split (50/50). The passage is anchored on the left, and the question appears on the right.
3. **Scroll Behavior**: The left and right panels scroll completely independently.
4. **Text Selection**: Highlighting behavior depends on the question type. Sometimes a vocabulary word is pre-highlighted in yellow (`#FFF2CC`) and clicking the highlight may anchor the scroll.
5. **Navigation**: Native free navigation. The user has access to `Back`, `Next`, and `Review` buttons to jump between questions within the Reading section safely.
