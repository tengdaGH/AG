**Section**: Listening
**CEFR Range**: A1–B2 (foundational listening, daily life dialogues)

## Construct

Measures the ability to understand a short, spoken question or statement and recognize an appropriate response in short dialogues on everyday life topics. Requires understanding both literal and implied meaning — essential for social interactions.

## Format

- **Stimulus**: A spoken question or statement forming the first part of a short two-speaker exchange. Audio only — NOT written on screen.
- **Response**: Test taker reads 4 written response options and selects the most appropriate response to the speaker's question/statement.
- **Questions**: Single-selection multiple choice

## Constraints

- **MCQ Quality**: All multiple-choice questions MUST strictly adhere to the guidelines in `.agent/knowledge/item-quality/mcq_item_quality.md` to ensure psychometric validity.
- Topics related to everyday life
- Speakers from four accent regions: North America, UK, Australia, New Zealand
- Audio stimulus only (no text shown for the spoken prompt)

## Skills Assessed

- Understand common vocabulary and formulaic phrases
- Understand simple grammatical structures, including question-formation patterns
- Recognize socially appropriate responses in short spoken exchanges
- Recognize and distinguish English phonemes and common intonation/stress patterns to convey meaning in carefully articulated speech
- Infer implied meaning, speaker role, or context in short spoken exchanges

## Example

**Audio**: "Didn't I just see you in the library an hour ago?"

**Options**:
- (A) Yes, I returned my books an hour ago.
- (B) No, I haven't been to the library today.
- (C) The library closes in an hour.
- (D) I usually study at the library.


## Visual Asset Generation (Pic Gen)

All visual assets must strictly adhere to the ETS testing visualization guidelines:
- **Style**: Clean, flat, educational textbook style vector art; minimalist and non-distracting.
- **Color Palette**: Muted colors, neutral backgrounds. Avoid overly vibrant or aggressive contrasting colors.
- **Characters**: Use distinct figures (e.g., specific male/female silhouettes) for dialogues, or generic/unisex figures for monologues.
- **No Text**: Do NOT include any readable English text or numbers in the illustrations.
- **Cultural Neutrality**: Settings must be universally recognizable (e.g., standard library, cafeteria) unless specifically dictated by the scenario.

## Interaction & Delivery Mechanics
### Delivery Sequence & States
1. **Introductory Prompt**: The narrator introduces the short utterance.
2. **Audio Playback**: The short utterance plays once. 
3. **Question State**: The question "What is the best response?" is often shown, but the exact audio options might not be read aloud depending on the variant, or they appear directly after the prompt.
4. **Strict Navigation**: Forward-only. No back button.
5. **Selection Mechanism**: The user clicks to select the most appropriate response from the list. Clicking Next and OK confirms the choice.
