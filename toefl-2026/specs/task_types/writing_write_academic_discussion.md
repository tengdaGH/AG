## Format

- **Stimulus**:
  1. A professor's post that briefly frames a topic and poses a related opinion question
  2. Brief posts from other students providing different positions on the issue
- **Task**: Test taker contributes their own position on the question, supporting their opinion with their own reasoning, experiences, or knowledge
- **Questions**: 1 written response per test form

- See `rubrics/writing_academic_discussion_rubric.md` for full rubric

## Scoring Dimensions & AI Features

| Dimension | Feature Examples |
|-----------|-----------------|
| Content ("Relevant and well-elaborated explanations … details") | Number of sentences, discourse coherence, similarity to question prompt |
| Syntactic/Lexical variety ("variety of syntactic structures and precise, idiomatic word choice") | Sentence variety, word frequency, correctness of collocations |

## Constraints

- The professor's question must be an opinion question (not factual)
- Student posts must present genuinely different positions
- Topic must be accessible without specialized knowledge
- The question should elicit argumentation, not just description

## Skills Assessed

- Clearly elaborate an argument for a position by responding to arguments and/or using information provided in short texts
- Produce adequately supported, clear, and cohesive text
- Make accurate and appropriate use of a range of grammatical structures and vocabulary
- Follow mechanical conventions of English (spelling, punctuation, capitalization)


## Interaction & Delivery Mechanics
### Delivery Sequence & States
1. **Split-Screen State**: The item loads immediately in a split-screen layout. The academic scenario and student responses are anchored on the left, while the writing area is on the right.
2. **Writing Area Rules**: The textarea is strictly plain-text. No rich text formatting (bold, italics) is available.
3. **Copy/Paste Restrictions**: Copying text from the left prompt and pasting it into the writing area is strictly disabled by the test shell to prevent plagiarism. Copy/pasting text *within* the user's own writing area may be allowed.
4. **Word Count**: A real-time word counter updates live as the user types (usually displayed near the top-right of the writing area).
5. **Auto-save**: The text input auto-saves periodically in the background.
6. **Navigation**: Forward-only. Once the user clicks "Next" or the total section timer expires, the response is submitted and they cannot return.
