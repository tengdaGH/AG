# Complete the Words (C-test)

**Section**: Reading
**CEFR Range**: A1–C2 (foundational skill, full spectrum)

## Construct

Measures the ability to process written texts for meaning and form. Tests vocabulary knowledge, syntactic awareness, and general reading proficiency through a cloze-type format. Highly predictive of global L2 proficiency.

## Format

- **Stimulus**: Paragraph-length text drawn from authentic sources (~10 truncated words per text)
- **Structure**: First sentence is intact. Starting from the second sentence, the second half of every second word is deleted.
- **Response**: Test taker provides the missing letters for each truncated word.
- **Questions per text**: 10 truncated words

## Constraints

- Each text must be a coherent, self-contained meaning unit — meaning should not depend on preceding/following passages.
- Texts are sampled and adapted from authentic, first-language sources.
- Topics must be common, widely accessible — not highly specialized.
- No technical vocabulary or jargon.
- No excessive use of proper nouns.
- Standard, grammatically accurate written English only.
- No hybridized forms of written communication (e.g., chat).
- No transcribed/reported dialogue.

## Skills Assessed

- Process written texts for meaning and form
- Vocabulary knowledge (predicts overall language proficiency)
- Knowledge of English syntax and word order rules
- Ability to reconstruct partially deleted words using contextual and morphological cues

## 3. Interaction & Delivery Mechanics
### Delivery Sequence & States
1. **Initial State (Passage Only)**: When the item first loads, only the passage is visible. The user must read to the end.
2. **Interactive State (Split-Screen)**: Clicking "Next" splits the screen. The passage moves to the left and the first "Complete the Word" question appears on the right.
3. **Scroll Behavior**: Independent scrolling. The relevant paragraph for the current blank may be contextually brought into view.
4. **Input Rules**: Text input is usually disabled; the user selects from a standardized dropdown or list of options for the exact blank.
5. **Navigation**: Native free navigation (`Back`, `Next`, `Review`).
