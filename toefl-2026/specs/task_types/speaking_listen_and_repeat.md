# Listen and Repeat

**Section**: Speaking
**CEFR Range**: A1–C2 (foundational speaking skill, full spectrum)

## Construct

Measures the ability to process spoken sentences and then accurately and intelligibly reproduce them. Tests speech processing, fluency, pronunciation, and intelligibility — foundational skills that predict overall speaking proficiency.

## Format

- **Stimulus**: A series of sentences within a scenario set in an academic or daily life setting
- **Visual**: A visual representation of the setting; progress through sentences corresponds to visual movement through the illustration
- **Structure**: After each sentence, there is a pause, then the test taker repeats exactly what was said
- **Progression**: Sentences get progressively longer and more complex
- **Questions**: 7 sentences per test form

## Scoring

- Scored 0–5 by AI engine + human raters
- See `rubrics/speaking_listen_repeat_rubric.md` for full rubric

## Scoring Dimensions & AI Features

| Dimension | Feature Examples |
|-----------|-----------------|
| Fluency | Speaking rate, length of uninterrupted runs (word sequences without pauses), number of pauses, number of hesitations |
| Intelligibility | Correctness of pronunciation, naturalness of speech rhythm, naturalness of prosody (e.g., syllable stress) |
| Repeat accuracy | Correctly repeated words, similarity to prompt |

## Constraints

- Scenario must provide a communicative purpose for listening and repeating
- Sentences must progress in length and complexity
- Setting must be visually representable
- Sentences must be natural, authentic English

## Skills Assessed

- Process spoken sentences for meaning and form
- Produce a spoken response that is an accurate repetition
- Produce clearly intelligible speech

## Example

**Scenario**: A tour guide at a zoo

**Sentences** (progressive difficulty):
1. "We have a variety of wildlife."
2. "Bears, wolves, and large cats are to the right."
3. "You can find sea lions and elephants further down the path."
4. "Please, no outside food or drinks, and do not feed the animals."
5. "Avoid banging or tapping on the displays and enclosures."
6. "For those with children, we offer summer camps and educational opportunities."
7. "The visitor's center, located near the front entrance, can give you more information."


## 3. Interaction & Delivery Mechanics
### Delivery Sequence & States
1. **Instruction State**: Brief instructions are shown and read.
2. **Audio Prompt**: The short sentence phrase is played exactly once.
3. **Beep**: A beep signals the start of recording. (Often there is no preparation time for this rapid-fire task).
4. **Recording State**: "Recording Time" counts down (e.g., 5-10 seconds). The mic visualizer is active.
5. **Stop & Save**: Recording stops automatically at 00:00.
6. **Auto-Advance**: The screen automatically transitions to the next item in the sequence.
