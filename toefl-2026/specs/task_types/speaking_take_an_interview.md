- **Situations**: Applying for scholarships, participating in a research study, and similar interview scenarios
- **Structure**:
  - Initial questions focus on factual information and personal experience
  - Later questions ask test takers to express and support opinions regarding broader issues
- **Questions**: 4 spoken responses per test form

## Scoring

- Scored 0–5 by AI engine + human raters
- See `rubrics/speaking_interview_rubric.md` for full rubric

## Scoring Dimensions & AI Features

| Dimension | Feature Examples |
|-----------|-----------------|
| Fluency | Speaking rate, length of uninterrupted runs (word sequences without pauses), number of pauses, number of hesitations |
| Intelligibility | Correctness of pronunciation, naturalness of speech rhythm, naturalness of prosody (e.g., syllable stress) |
| Language Use: Vocabulary & Grammar | Vocabulary diversity (wide range), vocabulary richness (less common words), grammaticality, grammatical accuracy |
| Organization | Discourse coherence, use of discourse connectives |

## Constraints

- Interview scenario must be realistic and accessible
- Questions must progress from factual/personal to opinion-based
- Topics must not require specialized knowledge
- The interviewer's prompts must provide natural conversational cues

## Skills Assessed

- Answer questions with appropriate and coherent elaboration
- Maintain a good conversational speaking pace
- Produce intelligible speech with good use of rhythm and intonation to convey meaning
- Make effective and accurate use of a range of vocabulary and grammatical structures

## Example

**Scenario**: Research study about experiences and perceptions of city living

**Interview prompts** (progressive):
1. "Do you currently live in a big city, a small town, or a village?"
2. "Cities affect people in different ways. Some people find cities dynamic and exciting. Others find that cities are overwhelming and drain them of energy. What kind of reaction do you have to cities? Why do you think you react in this way?"
3. "Some people believe that those who live in cities lead more interesting lives. They would argue, for example, that people who live in cities have more access to professional opportunities and interesting leisure activities. Do you agree that people who live in cities lead more interesting lives? Why or why not?"
4. "For some time now, researchers have been interested in whether green spaces, such as parks, make people who live in cities happier. Do you think that city governments should create more parks in urban areas to promote a general sense of happiness and life satisfaction? Why or why not?"


## Visual Asset Generation (Pic Gen)

All visual assets must strictly adhere to the ETS testing visualization guidelines:
- **Style**: Clean, flat, educational textbook style vector art; minimalist and non-distracting.
- **Color Palette**: Muted colors, neutral backgrounds. Avoid overly vibrant or aggressive contrasting colors.
- **Characters**: Use distinct figures (e.g., specific male/female silhouettes) for dialogues, or generic/unisex figures for monologues.
- **No Text**: Do NOT include any readable English text or numbers in the illustrations.
- **Cultural Neutrality**: Settings must be universally recognizable (e.g., standard library, cafeteria) unless specifically dictated by the scenario.

## Interaction & Delivery Mechanics
### Delivery Sequence & States
1. **Instruction State**: The narrator reads the overarching instructions for the interview task.
2. **Video Playback**: The virtual interviewer asks the question via video/audio. There are no pause/play controls.
3. **Preparation State**: A "Preparation Time" countdown timer (e.g., 20 seconds) appears and counts down to 00:00.
4. **Beep**: A distinct auditory "beep" signals the start of the recording window.
5. **Recording State**: A "Recording Time" countdown timer starts (e.g., 60 seconds). A microphone visualizer (e.g., a volume bar or pulsing icon) provides feedback that audio is being captured.
6. **Saving State**: When the timer hits 00:00, recording stops immediately. A brief "Saving..." indicator appears.
7. **Auto-Advance**: The test automatically advances to the next item. The user does not (and cannot) manually click "Next".
