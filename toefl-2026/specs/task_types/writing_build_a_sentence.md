# Build a Sentence

**Section**: Writing
**CEFR Range**: A1–C2 (foundational syntax skill, full spectrum)

## Construct

Measures command of English sentence structures — a skill essential for all written communication. Tests knowledge of syntax, word order rules, and grammatical accuracy.

## Format

- **Stimulus**: Several sentences with words or phrases displayed in the wrong order
- **Response**: Test taker moves (reorders) the words/phrases to form a grammatical sentence or question
- **Questions**: 10 sentences total per test form

## Scoring

- Each sentence scored correct (1) or incorrect (0)
- Raw score range: 0–10
- Key-scored (no AI or human rater scoring)

## Constraints

- Sentences must be unambiguous — only one correct word order
- Must test meaningful syntactic patterns, not trivial rearrangements
- Difficulty should progress across the set

## Skills Assessed

- Knowledge of English sentence structure and word order
- Understanding of grammatical relationships between sentence elements
- Recognition of question formation patterns


## Example

**Target Sentence**: The library is closed on Sundays during the summer.

**Word Bank** (scrambled): [during] [closed] [is] [summer] [Sundays] [the] [The] [on] [library]

**Correct Response**: The library is closed on Sundays during the summer.

## Interaction & Delivery Mechanics
### Delivery Sequence & States
1. **Split-Screen State**: The target image and word bank are displayed on the left, and the text input area is on the right.
2. **Writing Area Rules**: Strictly plain-text input.
3. **Word Bank Interaction**: The words provided are just text references; the task usually requires typing them out manually rather than dragging and dropping them into the input box.
4. **Navigation**: Forward-only. Clicking "Next" confirms the sentence.
