## Test Structure

| # | Section | Stages | Task Types | Scored Qs | Raw Score | Band Score |
|---|---------|--------|------------|-----------|-----------|------------|
| 1 | Reading | 2 (MST) | Complete the Words; Read in Daily Life; Read an Academic Passage | 35 | 0–35 | 1–6 |
| 2 | Listening | 2 (MST) | Listen and Choose a Response; Listen to a Conversation; Listen to an Announcement; Listen to an Academic Talk | 35 | 0–35 | 1–6 |
| 3 | Writing | 1 (linear) | Build a Sentence; Write an Email; Write for an Academic Discussion | 12 | 0–20 | 1–6 |
| 4 | Speaking | 1 (linear) | Listen and Repeat; Take an Interview | 11 | 0–55 | 1–6 |

**Total scored questions: 93** | **Overall band: 1–6** (average of section bands, 0.5 increments)

## MST Design (Reading & Listening)

- **Stage 1 (Router)**: Moderate difficulty (CEFR B1–B2). May include unscored tryout questions (Reading: up to 15; Listening: up to 12).
- **Stage 2**: Lower or Upper difficulty module, selected based on Stage 1 performance.
- **Paths**: Router + Lower OR Router + Upper. Both paths yield 35 scored questions.
- Scoring uses IRT true score equating across paths.

- **Writing (Email, Academic Discussion)**: Scored 0–5 by AI engine + human raters. Features: content elaboration, syntactic variety, social conventions, accuracy.
- **Speaking (Listen and Repeat)**: Scored 0–5. Features: fluency, intelligibility, repeat accuracy.
- **Speaking (Take an Interview)**: Scored 0–5. Features: fluency, intelligibility, vocabulary/grammar, organization.
- **Linking**: Writing and Speaking raw scores → scaled via weighted equipercentile linking.

## Construct Definition

The test measures a **hybrid construct**: (a) foundational skills (vocabulary knowledge, syntax/word order, aural/written processing for meaning and form) that predict global L2 proficiency, and (b) task-based communicative abilities in contextualized reading, listening, writing, and speaking tasks drawn from academic and daily life domains.

## Content Development Constraints

- No specialized background knowledge required
- Topics: history, art/music, business/economics, life science, physical science, social science
- Standard written English only (no chat/hybridized forms, no transcribed dialogue for reading)
- No excessive proper nouns or technical jargon
- Content reviewed for fairness (gender, L1, age, nationality)
- DIF analysis conducted; biased items removed
- Listening speakers: accents from North America, UK, Australia, New Zealand
