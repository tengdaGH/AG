    "topic": "Requiring Volunteer Work for Graduation",
    "professor_prompt": "This week we discussed the fact that in some education systems, doing volunteer work is a requirement for graduation from high school. That is, students would not receive their high school diplomas until they provide evidence of doing volunteer work to serve their community; for example, they might distribute food to the needy and document how many hours they spent doing that. In your post, discuss whether you agree or disagree with the idea of requiring volunteer work for graduation and why you feel that way.",
    "student_1_name": "Claire",
    "student_1_response": "While volunteering is important, I do not think requiring it is acceptable. An integral part of volunteering is one's willingness to sacrifice time and effort for the good of others without expecting a reward. If volunteering becomes a requirement, it loses that essential quality of not expecting a reward—because there would be a reward, namely, graduation.",
    "student_2_name": "Paul",
    "student_2_response": "While I agree with parts of Claire's argument, I like the idea of making volunteering a requirement. By having students practice the act of volunteering during high school, even if it is required and not merely out of goodwill, it will become a part of their lives that they will continue doing after they graduate.",

    "professor_prompt": "This week, we'll be talking about continuing education. Many people who have university degrees and work full-time jobs want to deepen their knowledge and skills. Some of them decide to continue their education by enrolling in advanced degree programs, such as master's or doctorate programs. Do you think that it is a good idea to pursue an advanced degree while continuing to work full-time? Why or why not?",
    "student_1_name": "Andrew",
    "student_1_response": "I think it's better to stop working and become a full-time student. It's challenging to combine a full-time job and studies, and one may easily fall behind. Focus on one thing at a time and do it well rather than try to do both and do neither very well. Overextending yourself can lead to disappointment.",

We have been discussing different ways people go about choosing what products to buy, and there are many potential sources of information and advice for consumers. In your opinion, which is the better strategy for making purchasing decisions, relying on advice from friends and family, or depending on information from online sources? Why?",
    "student_1_name": "Claire",
    "student_1_response": "I believe depending on online sources is the better strategy for making purchasing decisions. The internet provides access to numerous reviews, ratings, and detailed product comparisons that friends and family simply cannot match. When I researched my last laptop online, I found comprehensive specifications and user experiences that helped me make an informed choice. Online resources offer objectivity and a wider range of opinions from actual product users.",
    "student_2_name": "Paul",
    "student_2_response": "Asking friends and family members for product recommendations might seem like an easier option, but it might take too much time to get all the information you need. An internet search would be much more efficient. There are many consumer magazines available online that compile lots of data to compare the advantages and disadvantages of one product versus another. The last time I bought a computer, I just watched a few videos online to make a decision, and now I regret that. My friends could have advised me better because they know my preferences and the kind of features that I am interested in. Consumers should get advice from the people around them to find the most suitable products.",

    "professor_prompt": "This week, we'll be learning about different ways to help students develop good study skills. Let's begin by discussing the following situation. According to administrators at some universities, first-year students often arrive with poor study skills. These administrators believe that the best way to address the situation is to require all first-year students to take a course on good study habits. Do you agree that this requirement is a good idea? Why or why not?",
    "student_1_name": "Andrew",
    "student_1_response": "I support requiring all first-year students to attend a course on good study habits. Even basic skills such as how to take good notes are very important for succeeding in university studies, and I don't think all students acquire these skills while in high school. Many students would benefit from learning or refreshing these skills in a required course.",
    "student_2_name": "Paul",
    "student_2_response": "In my view, such a course should not be a university requirement. The efforts to improve study skills should begin in high school instead. That seems more appropriate.

  "Limiting Teaching of Fictional Texts": {
    "topic": "Education: Teaching Fiction vs. Nonfiction Texts",
    "professor_prompt": "Some educators think that in our global, tech-oriented world, students need to focus on nonfiction texts, such as news stories, technical manuals, or other informational materials. They say that reading poetry, novels, and short stories is not the optimal use of the limited time that students have in the classroom. How do you view this approach to education? Should schools limit the teaching of fictional texts in favor of teaching more practical, nonfiction texts?",
    "student_1_name": "Claire",
    "student_1_response": "In my point of view, I believe that the school should also provide students with the opportunity of learning literature and analyzing fictional texts. First, it is true that students who have chosen scientific fields of study could easily find their ideal occupations in the future, but studying literature would also enable students to find a wide range of jobs. For example, literature majors could choose to become editors or writers in the publishers; they could also choose to become reporters because they are more skillful in delivering messages of ideas orally; they could also become teachers and impart knowledge to other students. Therefore, studying literature would also help students find suitable jobs in the future. Besides, learning fictional texts would enable students to develop a good reading habit, increasing their interest in terms of reading books.",
    "student_2_name": "David",
    "student_2_response": "From my point of view, schools should teach more practical, nonfiction texts. Firstly, practical texts are more useful in job hunting than fiction texts do, since practical texts would solely focus on providing knowledge and theories that can be applied to people's future work. Therefore, schools need to offer students practical knowledge in order to provide a chance for them to secure ideal jobs. Especially, in these days, there are lots of people craving for one job now and one person needs to be truly outstanding enough so that he or she needs to have the practical skills that can be used immediately in the workplace. Fiction may be enjoyable, but it does not prepare students for the realities of the job market.",

    "professor_prompt": "In the past, progress in science and technology was generally slow. However, in recent decades, the pace of scientific and technological progress has increased dramatically, with new discoveries and inventions being developed almost every day. Some people think that this rapid progress in science and technology is beneficial for society overall and should be encouraged. Others believe this progress is happening too quickly and could create serious problems. Which view do you agree with, and why?",
    "student_1_name": "Andrew",
    "student_1_response": "The faster discoveries are made, the better. Thanks to advances in medicine, for example, our lives are so much better than those of our great-great-grandparents. Back then, life expectancy was much shorter because of a lack of medicines that today are inexpensive and widely available. Anyone with a serious medical condition hopes for rapid scientific progress.",
    "student_2_name": "Kelly",
    "student_2_response": "In my opinion, I believe that this progress is happening too fast and could have serious concerns. First, because these new technologies are not well developed yet, many negative impacts that people haven't thought about could exist. Our development of technology happened just a few hundred years ago, and it is still developing in a very fast speed. These will raise many concerns such as environmental issues, things could damage human health such as radiation and many more. Just like what happened during the Industrial Revolution, when people couldn't foresee the impact of greenhouse gases. Therefore, these underdeveloped and new technologies would cause more damage to people in the future if these rate isn't going to slow down. Furthermore, conflicts caused by technology are increasing, too. Due to the production of more variety of products, more and more resources are needed, which further forces the countries to fight over a certain raw material. For example, the conflict element, which are rare elements that are located in less developed countries causes forced labor, war, and serious human rights issues.",

In your response, you should do the following: Express and support your opinion. Make a contribution to the discussion in your own words. An effective response will contain at least 100 words. Dr. Achebe Today, we will examine what economists call incentives—the motivations that lead people to make certain choices. Cost is a major category of economic incentives. People tend to change their behavior when a particular choice gets more expensive. Let's discuss an example. Some economists argue that a good way to reduce air pollution is for governments to raise the cost (through taxes or other means) of fuel for cars. Do you agree or disagree with this viewpoint?",
    "student_1_name": "Andrew",
    "student_1_response": "I think it would be a good idea to raise fuel prices. Making it more expensive to drive cars would cause many people to choose public transportation or use bicycles instead. In my city, they've just added bicycle lanes to all of the major roads. So, it would be easy to give up driving.",
    "student_2_name": "Claire",
    "student_2_response": "I disagree. Why should individuals be punished with such an added expense in their daily lives? The argument for a consumer fuel tax makes the assumption that cars are the biggest source of air pollution, and we need to question if that's an accurate assumption.",

    "professor_prompt": "This semester, we are studying how children learn and what influences their cognitive development. We know that children are affected both positively and negatively by what they see and hear. Many parents allow their children to watch entertaining or educational videos on devices like smartphones or tablets. Overall, do you think watching a lot of online videos is harmful to children? Why or why not?",
    "student_1_name": "Andrew",
    "student_1_response": "I think watching online videos is harmful to children. Children under two years old need to develop communication skills by interacting with other people; passively watching videos exposes them to language, but it's not the same. Also, even for older children, sitting and staring at a device means they are not moving and exercising. I agree with Andrew that very young children who are learning to communicate should not watch a lot of videos. However, for children who are past that stage, videos can be great. Lots of kids' videos are about animals and nature. Most kids will never see a whale in its natural environment, but online, they can learn all about whales.",
    "student_2_name": "Aaire",
    "student_2_response": "From my point of view, young children shouldn't be exposed to online videos. First of all, watching online videos is not good for children's eyes. Since young children's eyes are still not fully developed and sensitive to long-term exposure to screens, the use of electronic devices will increase the risk of shortsightedness for young children, which will be clearly a significant drawback for their future life. Although some may argue that young children should be allowed to watch educational videos, the truth is that children's eye will be harmed by the screen of electronic devices regardless of what video they watch. In addition, addition to electronic devices is another crucial problem. Nowadays lots of apps have the mechanism that could send you the video that you'd like to watch, and children are likely to become indulged in it since their self-discipline skills are still not fully developed.",

Despite the emergence of digital platforms, traditional media such as television and books continue to have significant influence, shaping perspectives and opinions. In your view, is TV more important, or do books have a bigger effect on people in today's world? Share your thoughts and explain why you think that way.",
    "student_1_name": "Andrew",
    "student_1_response": "Books play a major role in our modern world because they offer specialized and in-depth knowledge. TV may give us the basics or a broad overview, but books really dig deep into various subjects, offering a full understanding and expert insights. This lets readers see different viewpoints and helps them think more critically. As a result, they can form well-rounded opinions based on comprehensive information.",
    "student_2_name": "Claire",
    "student_2_response": "From my perspective, TV has a greater impact on people's live in today's world. To begin with, more people prefer watching TV. Nowadays, with the development of Internet, almost everyone has a television in his or her home. During the free time, all people would choose watching TV as their best way of finding relaxation because it contains variety of recreational channels like argument channel, cartoon channel, shopping channel and so on. Through browsing through the TV, people sooth their pressure. On the contrary, reading books tend to further take people's energy because it's impossible to read without thinking, making it less appeal when it comes to free time. Besides, TV could benefit people's real life. Many of the TV channels contain advertisements, which are likely to encounter people's need. For example, my uncle has found his job when he noticed the employment advertisement on TV. However, books could not provide such realistic aid, but instead, they tend to be merely a form of escaping from the reality by indulging into a fictional world.",

What is one poor eating habit that would be important for most people to change, and why?",

Lecturing involves the teacher talking about a topic for an extended period of time and expecting students to learn by listening attentively. Today, some educators believe that teachers should limit how much time they spend lecturing and instead teach by encouraging in-class discussions and having students work in groups. However, some teachers still teach primarily by lecturing. Do you believe lecturing is an effective teaching method? Why or why not?",
    "student_1_name": "Claire",
    "student_1_response": "I think lecturing can be effective. Some teachers can explain even complex concepts by telling interesting stories and by providing memorable examples. When teachers lecture in an entertaining way, students enjoy attending class and feel motivated to learn. Whether a teacher's lectures are effective depends on the teacher.",
    "student_2_name": "Paul",
    "student_2_response": "In my opinion, lecturing is mainly ineffective because a teacher who only gives lectures can't know what's going on in students' minds. When a teacher lectures and students are just required to sit there, the teacher can't really check if students understand the lecture. Students have to contribute somehow to show whether or not they are learning. Active participation through discussions and group work allows teachers to identify misconceptions immediately and adjust their instruction accordingly. Relying solely on lectures creates a passive learning environment where students may become disengaged and retain less information.",

You know that if you stay in one place for a long time, you will always have friends you can rely on when you need help. Moving from one city to another has some advantages. Adapting to different situations is an important skill to have in life, and moving forces a person to develop this skill. Having to make new friends and start over in a new city is a challenging exercise that builds character.",

Do you agree? Why or why not?",
    "student_1_name": "Alex",

What do you believe and why?",
    "student_1_name": "Kelly",

Businesses, for example, often spend a lot of money on scientific research in order to make a discovery that can lead to profit. Even if that discovery benefits everyone, the business has a right to keep the discovery secret so that it can develop a profitable product from the research. Sharing knowledge is crucially important to most scientists. Scientists usually publish the details of their discoveries in scientific journals, which means that everyone can see what the scientists have accomplished. Being recognized as the person who made a discovery is the biggest reward for any scientist. When scientists keep their discoveries secret, they lose that recognition. That is very unsatisfying.",

To begin with, the action of sharing scientific information would contribute to a faster development of the whole society. Many scientists would spend numerous hours working in their labs to conduct research and wait for the results; however, if other researchers have already finished the same kind of experiment upon the same subjects, it would save other scientists a great deal of time if the outcome of the experiment is to be shared. Therefore, all scientists could have more time focusing on more pressing subjects and topics. Second, such behavior would also encourage more people to participate in the scientific world, since a lot of data and key information are easily available in the shared community.",

Rural living typically has less noise from traffic and crowds. The quiet allows more relaxation and connection with nature. The less hurried pace of rural life appeals to those wanting to escape the stress of urban environments.",
    "student_2_name": "Andrew",

The air tends to be cleaner and fresher with less pollution from factories, cars, and high population density.

Socializing in smaller groups versus larger circles can have varying effects on one's health and happiness. Some argue that smaller groups foster deeper connections, allowing for more meaningful interactions and a sense of closeness. Conversely, larger friend circles offer diversity and exposure to different perspectives. Which do you think contributes more to a person's health and happiness: spending time with a close-knit few or a larger group of friends?",
    "student_1_name": "Andrew",
    "student_1_response": "Developing strong bonds with a few close friends fosters deeper connections and enhances emotional support. These intimate relationships often lead to increased trust and understanding, allowing for genuine empathy and shared experiences. Small friend groups offer a sense of security and authenticity in interactions, promoting mental well-being. For me, a closer, smaller social circle is better. The first reason is that small social circles foster close emotion supports. In a large social group, since everyone has to maintain their relationship with other group members, the opportunity of close communication between each team members will be very small. As a result, close emotional connection are not likely to form between team members in a large team. However, in a small social group, each team member will have enough time and chance to understand others, and whenever who needs an emotional support, other members could easily help him or her. In addition, living in a smaller group is more relaxing. Since we only need to contact a few members in a small social circle, the pressure of living in that group will be much less comparing to a large group, and we will be more relaxed as well.",
    "student_2_name": "Claire",
    "student_2_response": "Having a wide circle of friends offers diverse perspectives and experiences, enriching one's social life. Numerous friendships provide a larger support network, creating opportunities for various activities and interests. Engaging with a larger group cultivates adaptability, social skills, and exposure to different cultures or ideas, contributing to personal growth. From my perspective, spending time with a larger group of friends contributes more to a person's health and happiness. The main reason is that larger group of friends creates more chances of sharing activities and obtaining thoughts. Since numerous friendships means numerous different individual thoughts and hobbies, we would expose ourselves to tremendous numbers of diverse communication and party. For instance, I could learn about philosophical ideas from my philosophy major friends or be informed with knowledge of physical perspective from my physics major friends. I could also go hiking with the people I met in a trip, or go fishing with friends known from my fishing class. There are numerous opportunities to try more engagements and gain relaxation. However, only having a small range of friends, our engagement type could be restrained based on the characteristics of few people and would not be that diversified.",

Some educators argue that online courses provide greater flexibility and accessibility, while others contend that the lack of face-to-face interaction significantly diminishes the educational experience. In your opinion, can online learning be as effective as traditional classroom instruction? Please explain your reasoning and support your position with specific examples.",

Many students, particularly working adults, would not have access to quality education without online options.",

  "Online Shopping Is Affecting Society？": {
    "topic": "Online Shopping and Its Effect on Society",
    "professor_prompt": "More and more, online shopping is becoming the primary way that many people obtain everyday goods. But what are the ramifications for the society in which we live? On the one hand, online shopping has advantages -for example, I can make a purchase without ever leaving my home. However, with fewer people shopping at local shops, in some places, these establishments are having a hard time competing. Do you think that online shopping is, on the whole, affecting society?",
    "student_1_name": "Paul",
    "student_1_response": "I think that online shopping has had negative impacts on society. In my city, many local stores have shelves filled with various products that you can find in online stores. This has forced some of them to close down, which not only affects the amount of tax revenue generated in our local community but also impacts the number of job opportunities available to the community members.",
    "student_2_name": "Kelly",
    "student_2_response": "It's unfortunate that some local stores are forced to close down, but that's the nature of competition. As consumers, we benefit greatly from online shopping due to lower prices. Even if I find a physical store that can compete with online sellers in terms of pricing, I am still likely to make the purchase online because it means I don't have to spend money on transportation to the store. From my point of view, online shopping has a positive influence on society overall. First of all, online shopping can enhance the economy. Online shopping allows customers to make purchases at their home rather than going to shops in person, and people will be more motivated to buy products online since the effort they need to spend on taking a walk to shops is saved. As a result, the economy will be enhanced by the online shopping services. For instance, readers may be reluctant to buy new books that are sold only in bookstores that are far away from them, but problems like that won't exist if they could buy them online. In addition, online shopping can save time for people. Since they don't need to travel to the physical stores to buy products, the time on the road will be saved, which will allow people to spend more time on other things, including academic works or pursuing their own interests.",

Consumers don't use physical money to pay for things as much as they used to. Online shopping has a big impact on this. But even when shopping in person, more people are using credit cards, cash cards, and phone apps to make purchases. So do you think the decrease in using cash is positive or negative? Why?",
    "student_1_name": "Andrew",
    "student_1_response": "I think it's great. I avoid using physical money. The main reason is that I don't want to carry around a wallet stuffed with paper bills and coins. I carry my mobile phone with me anyway, so why carry two things when I only need one? Using my phone to pay for things in the store is a huge convenience.",
    "student_2_name": "Claire",
    "student_2_response": "I think it's negative. It's easier to keep track of your spending when you use cash. When paying with cards or phone apps, it's easy to ignore how much you spend and go over your budget. But with physical money, you are more aware of your spending, and if you run out of cash, you can't spend any more! Moreover, putting all the money on apps or cards would have risks. Due to the development of technology, online scamming is getting more and more popular.

One advertising strategy that companies often use is to ask celebrities, famous entertainers, or sports figures to promote their products. However, some experts believe that it is more effective to have ordinary people talk about the product. Which of these two advertising strategies do you think is better?",
    "student_1_name": "Paul",
    "student_1_response": "I like the \"ordinary people\" approach. People are more interested in a product when they see people like themselves using the product. I think this is even true for clothing advertisements, which traditionally use famous models. People get a better idea of whether they like the clothes when they see all kinds of different people wearing them, and not just models.",
    "student_2_name": "Claire",
    "student_2_response": "I agree with Paul's point of view over this matter. Of course, it is effective to get celebrities or famous entertainers to advocate or endorse a product, because these people are always well recognized and very influential. However, getting ordinary people to talk about a product can be very influential as well. When people see others like themselves discussing a product authentically, they tend to trust the recommendation more.

On one hand, investing in the arts can have many benefits for society, such as promoting creativity, cultural awareness, and preserving history. On the other hand, there are concerns about the high cost of supporting the arts, and the argument that funding should be directed towards more practical and tangible improvements for the community, such as improving public facilities and infrastructure. What do you think? Should the government spend more money on art and music museums than on facilities like playgrounds and public swimming pools? Why or why not?",
    "student_1_name": "Kelly",
    "student_1_response": "From my perspective, the money should be spent on facilities like playgrounds and public swimming pools. The main reason is that such fund would generate economic benefit. Nowadays, facilities are considered as one of the most imperative factors when it comes to the choice of residence. Many people would choose the city with premium facilities as their ideal living place because those facilities could guarantee living standard. If the government provides fund to a city's facility, it would make the city a tremendously appealing place to work and live, attracting sufficient labors to promote local economy. Besides, the increasing quality of facilities may improve tourism, further developing economic growth. On the contrary, funding art museums may not have such an obvious impact on the economy, since fewer people are interested in arts due to the higher level of pressure that people bear in modern life.",
    "student_2_name": "Andrew",
    "student_2_response": "In my opinion, the government should allocate more funding to art and music museums rather than playgrounds and swimming pools. The primary reason is that museums play a crucial role in preserving our cultural heritage and history for future generations. Art and music museums house priceless collections that teach us about our ancestors, different civilizations, and the evolution of human creativity. Without proper funding, these invaluable artifacts could deteriorate or be lost forever. Additionally, museums provide unique educational opportunities that playgrounds and swimming pools cannot offer. Schools frequently organize field trips to museums to expose students to art, history, and culture, which broadens their perspectives and nurtures appreciation for the arts. While playgrounds and swimming pools certainly have value for physical recreation, the intangible benefits of cultural enrichment and education that museums provide are far more significant and lasting for society as a whole.",

    "student_1_name": "Andrew",
    "student_1_response": "In my opinion, governments should not charge drivers additional fees to drive during rush hours. Imposing such financial burdens on citizens, especially during peak commuting times, would create significant economic disadvantage for many working families. Many employees have no choice but to drive to work early in the morning or late in the evening, and adding extra costs would simply punish those who rely on their vehicles for livelihood. Furthermore, such policies would disproportionately affect lower-income workers who cannot afford alternative transportation options. Instead of penalizing drivers, governments should focus on improving public transportation infrastructure and expanding road capacity to genuinely address congestion issues.",
    "student_2_name": "Claire",
    "student_2_response": "As far as I'm concerned, governments should charge drivers for certain amount of fees to drive during rush hours. To begin with, as is known to all, traffic congestion is a serious social problem nowadays and many drivers are stuck on the road for a long time. By setting such a rule, many people will consider a lot before deciding whether they will drive their private cars or not. In this way, many citizens, especially the relatively less wealthy ones, will probably select an alternate way of transportation, such as the subway, due to their heavy financial burden. Moreover, the governments can earn money to solve the rushing hour problem more directly. For example, the government can use their budget to build additional roads in the city to support multiple choices for drivers in order to relieve traffic congestion.",

When products first come out, they're often quite expensive, but once they've been on the market for a while, the price usually drops. That's why I usually wait to buy new technology.",
    "student_2_name": "Claire",
    "student_2_response": "New tech products might not always be more expensive—sometimes the company will give people a new product at a discount in exchange for trying it out and giving feedback on it.

Some people conclude that inaction— that is, doing nothing—makes the world a worse place. In your post, please discuss the causes or the effects of this social phenomenon; in other words, what are some reasons why people might choose not to help others, or what are some results of this inaction?",
    "student_1_name": "Andrew",
    "student_1_response": "In my opinion, one of the main causes behind this phenomenon of people not helping others is concern for one's own interests. If I come across someone in a situation who needs help, I will want to help that person—but not if it creates some significant problem for me. Doing so will simply put us both in a bad situation.",
    "student_2_name": "Kelly",
    "student_2_response": "I agree that inaction makes the world worse. That means that we all have the responsibility to make the world a better place. An important effect of people not taking on this responsibility is that we may feel less trusting of our neighbors. Conversely, when others show that they are willing to help people, our community becomes stronger. In my opinion, I believe there are several reasons why people nowadays might not be willing to help others. First, helping other people might cause unnecessary trouble for us. For example, many commuters might have to reach their destination as soon as possible in the morning, but if they see someone in need on the street and choose to help them, such as giving other people a ride, they might have to face the consequence of being late for their work or other important matter. Second, some urgent situation might demand professional people to deal with, and it might be the best option for common people not intervene. For example, if a person suddenly experiences a heart attack, what he or she really needs is a professional doctor or people equipped with medical knowledge. Only people who understand how to do CPR could save that person. As a result, many people might not choose to help even if their inaction might delay the best timing of saving that person.",

Others believe that using only a mobile app is not a very effective way to learn a foreign language well. In this discussion post, I would like you to indicate which of those views you support, and why.",
    "student_1_name": "Student 1",
    "student_1_response": "In my opinion, I believe that learning a foreign language only on a mobile app is not an effective way. To begin with, this lack of communication with people who are fluent could cause a hard time for people to understand the idioms. In a language, people would have to create their own idiom to describe things or to communicate efficiently. Talking to a person who is fluent in that language for example their teachers, could help people to better understand that culture and pick up different idioms during the conversation. However, if people just study it on a phone, they would have a hard time linking it to the knowledge they already have. Admittedly, it is true that people could learn all those vocabularies and grammar online easily, but it would be harder for them to remember comparing to having a class. Furthermore, many apps might contain errors that could cause a misunderstanding of knowledge. Nowadays, even the most well-developed app could have errors and bugs, which could decrease the quality and efficiency of learning the target language.",

My classmates will probably all be at a similar proficiency level as me and are just as motivated as me to learn the language. I believe that mobile applications are probably the way to go when it comes to language learning. I do see the points made by my peer, but for me, the benefits of mobile apps are way better. For example, using a mobile app allows you to learn at your own convenience without the limitations of time and location that often characterize learning in a classroom with a teacher.",

It might sound unimportant at first, but I have heard of companies that provide their employees with a variety of food options in their facility.

By increasing the working condition, the hygiene factor would be achieved, leading to greater happiness of the employees. The employees would also compare the working environment of all those companies when the salaries they receive is the same amount as from the company with better working condition would be more attractive. Furthermore, having this good working environment could help the old employees to give compliments to the company.

    "student_1_name": "Paul",
    "student_1_response": "In my opinion, I believe teacher's salaries should be raised. To begin with, it is known to all that the general salary for teachers is not in the same league as that for other industries such as finance or business. Therefore, many talented people would consider those more profitable occupations when deciding their careers. However, if the overall salary for teachers could be increased, more capable and competitive people would start choosing teachers as their professions. With more experts and professionals in education industry, the quality of students' courses will also be significantly boosted, which would in turn result in better academic performances among students. These students would have a bigger chance to make more valuable contribution to the whole society and make the world a better place. Admittedly, some people believe that spending money on additional resources is a good option, but raising teachers' salaries and encouraging them to do more research and improve their teaching skills would generate far more benefit than buying more advanced computers or books for students.",
    "student_2_name": "Kelly",
    "student_2_response": "I believe that additional resources for students are more important than raising teachers' salaries. For one thing, many students in schools do not have a good access to a wide range of information due to the lack of proper computers and books. It is the school's duty to install more equipment to facilitate students' studies. For example, students could learn more details about certain animals during biology class if they have a good projector to cast images; they could go comfortably to the schools' libraries to do their researches instead of going to other places if schools have a vast collection of books covering more topics and fields. For another thing, raising teachers' salaries might result in some negative consequence. For instance, some teachers might spend more time pursuing their personal interests rather than focusing on their teaching responsibilities if they are already well-compensated.",

  "Shop at Small Local Stores Or Superstores": {
    "topic": "Retail Sales: Small Local Stores vs Superstores",
    "professor_prompt": "This week, we will be discussing retail sales. One popular model of retail is \"superstores\"—very large stores, typically owned by corporations—that sell many kinds of different products. We will compare this business model to local retailers, typically small or specialized stores with local owners, such as a camera shop or a small neighborhood grocery store. Do you think it is more beneficial for people to shop at small local stores rather than at superstores? Why or why not?",
    "student_1_name": "Kelly",
    "student_1_response": "Shopping at small local stores benefits consumers in many ways. One of the benefits is that small stores often offer better services than large stores. For example, if you need your bicycle repaired, usually the small shop can do it right there in the shop. At the large stores, they have to send it to the manufacturer to be repaired. Although I understand the importance of shopping at small stores to support the local community, there are obvious benefits to shopping at superstores. Because large retailers procure products in bulk, they can offer their customers a wide variety of products, usually at low prices. So, by shopping at large stores, consumers get better value for their money.",
    "student_2_name": "Andrew",
    "student_2_response": "From my perspective, I don't think it's more beneficial for people to shop at small local stores rather than at superstores. To begin with, the local supermarket usually closes early, so its opening hours are not long enough to meet the requirements of most people. For instance, small local supermarkets are usually run by individuals, so we cannot guarantee that the shops will be open all day. Although some small supermarkets have a better service, just imagine, when we go to the small stores at midnight with no one to help, it would be even more inconvenient. In contrast, superstores not only operate all day, but also help us solve problems better since they have more staff to provide necessary aid for consumers. On top of that, superstores usually have a variety of goods. When people shop in a large supermarket, they usually buy more than they need to use. In that case, it decreases the number of times they go shopping, thus, reducing their chances of driving and reducing air pollution.",

    "professor_prompt": "While owning lots of consumer products is believed to increase the quality of life, these products can also impose responsibilities on those who own them. For example, electronic devices, appliances, and vehicles require constant attention and regular maintenance. Possessions also need to be stored and organized, taking up time and space. For these reasons, some people argue that having many possessions can actually decrease the quality of life. Do you agree or disagree? Why?",
    "student_1_name": "Claire",
    "student_1_response": "I totally agree that an excess of possessions can drag down our quality of life. Just think about the time we spend organizing closets or garages. I spend hours every month sorting and storing clothes in my closet. This clutter and the time it takes to manage it can become overwhelming and detract from enjoying life.",
    "student_2_name": "Paul",

  "Social Media Influencers": {
    "topic": "Social Media Influencers",
    "professor_prompt": "This week, we discussed the importance of role models and opinion makers in society. One idea we discussed was the widespread impact of 'influencers.' Influencers are people who are very active posting on social media and who have many followers. Influencers' posts and opinions can influence their followers' choices on everything from fashion to politics. In your opinion, do social media influencers generally have a positive or negative effect on their followers? Why do you think so?",
    "student_1_name": "Paul",
    "student_1_response": "In my point of view, social media influencers have largely created negative impacts on society as well as their followers. To start with, being a social media influencer means that they have to gain enough network traffic from users, so that they could sell products through their accounts. However, in order to gain such online exposure, some influencers might choose to display some reckless or even aggressive behaviors. For example, they might choose to record videos of fighting with people randomly on the street; or they might do some illegal things while doing livestreaming, such like a big livestreaming scandal uncovered in South Korea last year, where people were being manipulated. Such things would create terrible influence on the whole society. For instance, some young adolescents might imitate such course of actions with a false hope of making money or becoming famous, which would in turn create turmoil and instability in the community.",
    "student_2_name": "Kelly",
    "student_2_response": "I think the influencers' effect is generally positive. People can learn about the latest trends and topics in a very quick and efficient way by following influencers. In the past, people had to spend time looking through magazines or visiting boutiques to even know what was trending. Additionally, many influencers use their platform for good causes. They often participate in charity or government projects to bring awareness to important social issues. They also encourage people to get involved in their communities and share the experience of becoming more active citizens. While it is true that some influencers might do inappropriate things for more exposure and attention, I believe that platforms could implement strict laws and regulations to prevent such behaviors.",

Now, though, some people advocate a shorter workweek: a four-day workweek with no decrease in workers' pay. There are advantages and disadvantages to this, of course. What is your opinion about instituting a shorter, four-day workweek, and why?",
    "student_1_name": "Andrew",
    "student_1_response": "I like that idea, but on one condition: that the workday is no longer than eight hours. I have heard some plans require ten hours a day for a four-day week. Most employees would find that exhausting, and it could actually be counterproductive to tire out your workers. Yes to four-day weeks, but no to ten-hour days!",
    "student_2_name": "Claire",
    "student_2_response": "I totally agree with the idea of having a four-day workweek. To begin with, shorter working hours can give people time to relax and promote the happiness index of residents in such a stressful world. Personally, I will choose to spend that spare time with my family or devote it for my hobbies, and doing this will surely ease my anxiety. Moreover, it will also promote a relaxed atmosphere in the workplace leading to a better work experience and results. Some people might say doing the same amount of work within four days will cause an increase on people's working pressure on every single work day. However, the four-day workweek will lead to a higher working efficiency on each work day. And efficiency is what people admire the most in such high pace world life, not to mention the pressure mentioned above can be easily compensated by the weekend with an extra day.",

For example, some governments have programs that focus on space exploration. They spend great sums of money to train astronauts and build spacecraft that can travel beyond Earth's atmosphere. Do you think that space exploration is a good use of a government's money and resources? Why or why not?",
    "student_1_name": "Andrew",
    "student_1_response": "I don't think space exploration is a good use of public funds. I've noticed that sometimes when a government introduces a new spacecraft, it has years of technical difficulties or fails to reach its destination. That's quite a waste of years of work and money. In my opinion, space exploration is not worth the expense.",
    "student_2_name": "Claire",
    "student_2_response": "Just because a space program doesn't go exactly as planned doesn't mean it was a waste. Government space programs are worthwhile because they allow people to work together to achieve something great, even if it takes a long time.

Others choose to work while slowly progressing towards a degree. Given these options, I'm curious to know your thoughts. After finishing your undergraduate studies, do you prefer pursuing an advanced degree full-time or continuing work while studying part-time?",
    "student_1_name": "Andrew",
    "student_1_response": "I think it's better to go to college full-time instead of trying to balance part-time classes and a full-time job. For me, I know I wouldn't be able to focus on my studies if I was exhausted from work all the time. Full-time college allows me to put all my energy into my classes and get the most out of my education. Trying to do both college and work full-time seems way too stressful for me to handle. I'd rather get my degree done faster by being a full-time student.",
    "student_2_name": "Claire",
    "student_2_response": "I think going to college part-time while working is better because I can use what I learn in class at my job right away. The classes feel more relevant when I'm able to apply the material to real work situations. Instead of just memorizing concepts, I get to see how they work in practice. And getting work experience while I study looks good on my resume. I think balancing the two helps me get more out of my classes and prepares me for my career at the same time.

  "Take Breaks from Reading Or Watching News": {

    "professor_prompt": "In this course, we've been studying current events and discussing the value of being educated consumers of news. However, there is also an opinion that we should periodically limit our exposure to current events and even take breaks from the news. Do you think it is beneficial to take breaks from reading or watching the news for a period of a few days or weeks? Why or why not?",
    "student_1_name": "Claire",
    "student_1_response": "In my opinion, it is beneficial for people to take breaks from all the different news. First, it can reduce people's anxiety and stress levels. With the development of technology, many different kinds of news appear in people's daily lives. People are also being exposed to numerous negative news reports every day, which will easily affect people's moods and contribute to their stress and anxiety. Taking a break allows individuals to disconnect from the constant flow of information, and prioritize their mental well-being. In this way, they can be well prepared for new pieces of information they are facing, and reduce mental stress. Second, it can also improve people's productivity. News consumption is usually time-consuming, taking a break from reading news allows people to have more free time, and they can spend that time with more valuable uses to improve efficiency and productivity.",
    "student_2_name": "Andrew",
    "student_2_response": "Beneficial or not, it would be impossible. Today, we're exposed to the news everywhere—on our phones, on our computers, on big TV screens in waiting rooms and in airport lounges. To take a break from the news, you would have to withdraw from all activities in society, which is unrealistic. I think that taking a break from the news could be helpful psychologically. It obviously depends on how long a break we take. Completely avoiding watching or reading the news may be too extreme, but taking a short break from the news could help us avoid news stories that may affect us negatively.",

Some educators believe that the best way to motivate young students is to give them interesting, hands-on activities that make learning fun. Others believe that rewarding young learners with extra playtime or treats for remaining focused and completing activities is the best way to motivate them. Which approach do you think teachers should emphasize in their classrooms? Why?",
    "student_1_name": "Andrew",
    "student_1_response": "Making learning fun is a way to get students interested in learning. If they're having fun, they may grow to value learning in and of itself. My fourth-grade teacher made history come alive, and I've been an avid history buff ever since. If children are shown that learning itself is worthwhile, they're more likely to become lifelong learners.",

    "professor_prompt": "Your professor is teaching a class on educational psychology. Write a post responding to the professor's question. In your response, you should do the following: Express and support your opinion. Make a contribution to the discussion in your own words. An effective response will contain at least 100 words. Dr. Diaz: Secondary or high school students (ages 14-18) who plan to attend university must begin thinking about what field of study they'll enter. Some students might be directed into certain fields by their parents and teachers. Others prefer to make their own choice based on their own interests and feelings. Do you believe that secondary school students should be allowed to choose their own field of study at university without being guided by parents and teachers? Why?",
    "student_1_name": "Kelly",
    "student_1_response": "I think it's a mistake to let students at that age make such an important decision on their own. They usually don't have the wisdom to choose appropriately. The people who know them best—their parents and teachers—will be more objective and give the best guidance. In my opinion, I believe that students who are currently studying in secondary school should not be allowed to choose their own field of study at university without any guide from parents or teachers. To begin with, many secondary students do not have a clear picture as to different field of studies, whereas teachers or parents, who are more experienced than young adolescents, would be equipped with more information and thus are able to make better choice. For example, professional teachers would know the future careers of studying different field, and they would thus inform students what it would be like in the future if they choose certain majors, helping them to understand the bigger picture. Besides, many parents would have a better understanding regarding their children's strength, making their advice on students' future majors far more useful and valuable. Therefore, secondary students should consult their parents or teachers about their future majors.",
    "student_2_name": "Andrew",
    "student_2_response": "Choosing a field of study, and perhaps a career in that field, based mainly on what others tell you to do seems wrong to me. My parents wanted me to study engineering, but I'm not interested in that; I want to help people learn. I know I'll struggle more financially as a teacher, but I'm sure I'll be happier. In my point of view, students studying in secondary school should have the opportunity to choose their future field of study. For starters, only students could know where their true interests lie, which is the reason why their own choice would be the best fit for themselves. For example, my cousin James is extremely interested in language studying, and he has started analyzing different languages in Europe at a young age. However, his parents forced him to study computer science as a college major, believing that this would increase his chance of securing a better job in the future. The consequence of this was that my cousin could not learn anything about his course work because he had absolutely no passion for this subject. Second, many children are able to acquire far more information regarding different subjects than before, thanks to the development of Internet. Such technology allowed for an easy availability for students to gain access to what it would be like if they choose certain field of study, enabling them to make great choice without being guided by parents or teachers.",

To begin with, many people would develop this addiction which could lead to more trouble due to the amount of time they spend on it. In modern society, it is easy for people to develop an addiction and be unaware of it due to the development of technology. Many people would sit on the sofa watching sports for the whole day and not feeling tired, which is a really bad habit. This unawareness could lead to conflict between families because they don't spend time with them; lack of exercise due to the amount of time they spend watching sports; or extreme expenditure like buying extreme amounts of sports events tickets. All of those would further damage them physically, financially, and socially. Furthermore, having this extreme affection toward sport could also cause conflict between people. Because many sports fans are quite extreme sometimes due to this strong support for their team, they could have conflicts with fans of other teams. This could lead to very extreme actions like riots and physical combats, that could damage the countries' reputation and individuals' health.",
