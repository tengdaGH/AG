    "raw_ocr_text": "In my point of view, there are several disadvantages to being an early adopter. Firstly, being a new\nadopter to always buy the company's newest product can cost a person more money than\nwaiting to buy it later. This is because the new products just launched by the company are usually\nmore expensive, and the price would like to drop along time. For example, the iPhones are about\n10 thousand RMB at first since it is brand new with updated designs and functions. However, as\nmore and more people buy it, the marginal profit of the product gets more and more, along with\nthe devaluation of electronic devices due to the fast development of technologies and the fact\nthat the materials it is being made of are consumable. This will lead to a continuous decline in\nthe price of the iPhone. Such is the disadvantage of being an early adopter. Moreover, trying the\nlatest product can contain not only high prices but high risks on the usage experience. The fact\nthat the product is new means whether the product is good or not is uncertain. Therefore, the\nnew adopters could take the risk of getting a terrible product or service at a high cost, which is\n\nnot worthy at all. 210words\n"
