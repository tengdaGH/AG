    "topic": "Business Skills: Sales vs Management",
    "professor_prompt": "Let's discuss the skills most needed by people who want to start and run their own business. Some experts propose that future businesspeople should focus on improving their sales techniques —after all, if you cannot sell your product, you will soon be out of business. Others believe that these future businesspeople would benefit most from learning management skills, such as how to lead teams and motivate employees. Which view do you agree with? Why?",
    "student_1_name": "Andrew",
    "student_1_response": "I think that management skills are most important. Sales tasks are something that a businessperson can delegate to a team of salespeople once the business gets going, so it is really important that the future businessperson develops skills to manage teams of people. Without that, it is not very likely that the business will grow.",
    "student_2_name": "Kelly",
    "student_2_response": "Learning how to sell your product is the most essential task. I've read about people who had ideas about exciting new products to build a business around. They borrowed capital and started their business, but they could not explain to the public what made the products exciting. Since they could not sell enough products, their business failed.",

Often it is children who ask to keep and care for a pet of their own, or who share the responsibility of caring for a pet with other family members. In your opinion, do children gain important benefits from caring for a pet animal? Why or why not?",
    "student_1_name": "Kelly",
    "student_1_response": "I can think of one clear benefit. When you read interviews with famous scientists, especially biologists, you learn that their interest in science was often awakened because they had a pet animal or animals as children. Playing with the animals and observing them led those people to develop an interest in natural science.",
    "student_2_name": "Andrew",
    "student_2_response": "I think there often isn't any real benefit. What typically happens, unfortunately, is that parents get a pet animal for their child because the child likes animals in books or films. But when they have to take care of a real animal, those children lose interest, and it's the parents who end up taking care of it.",

One way is to require companies to pay penalties, such as higher taxes or large fines, when they pollute and damage the environment. We're going to explore this topic in depth tomorrow, but first I'd like to get your thoughts: Do you think imposing these taxes and fines would be a good way to stop companies from harming the environment? Why or why not?",

    "student_2_name": "Claire",
    "student_2_response": "I think it's an excellent idea. As long as there is no penalty for polluting the environment, these companies will not bother searching for alternatives to practices that contribute to air, water, or land pollution.

Let's focus now on the following viewpoint: it is no longer useful to spend many years pursuing a traditional, specialized university degree in a single field, such as communications or economics. Instead, it makes more sense for most people to complete several shorter certification programs and earn certificates in, for example, project management, computer programming, graphic design, and so on. Do you agree or disagree with this viewpoint? Why?",
    "student_1_name": "Andrew",
    "student_1_response": "I agree that completing short certification programs makes a lot of sense these days because people are more likely to change careers now than they were in the past. Certification programs allow people to quickly learn a variety of professional skills that are in demand at the moment. And acquiring such skills leads to more job opportunities.",
    "student_2_name": "Claire",
    "student_2_response": "I see the advantages of earning certificates, but I don't think that they can completely replace university degrees. Certification programs provide only superficial knowledge, while university degrees offer a well-developed and organized approach to studying. By pursuing university degrees, students gain foundational knowledge and a broader understanding of their field of study and develop many skills as well.",

Other than recycling, what is one action that a person could take that would have the greatest impact on protecting the environment? Why?",
    "student_1_name": "Kelly",
    "student_1_response": "It might be better to pay more attention when we are shopping and to avoid purchasing items that aren't environmentally friendly, such as single-use plastic items.

    "student_2_name": "Andrew",

On the discussion board, I want you to exchange ideas about what schools can do to make the transition to a new school easier for teenagers.",
    "student_1_name": "Student 1",

Others argue that this approach is not effective. What is your opinion on this policy?",
    "student_1_name": "Student 1",
    "student_1_response": "I believe that taxing fuel and using the revenue to subsidize electricity is a reasonable policy approach. By making fuel more expensive, the government can encourage people to reduce their fuel consumption, which would help protect the environment. Additionally, subsidizing electricity costs would make it more affordable for families and businesses to use energy. This could be especially helpful for low-income households that struggle to pay their electricity bills.",
    "student_2_name": "Student 2",
    "student_2_response": "While I understand the reasoning behind this policy, I think it may not be the most effective approach. Taxing fuel heavily could place a significant financial burden on people who rely on vehicles for their daily commute or work, such as delivery drivers or construction workers. Instead, the government should invest in extra training programs for workers in fossil fuel industries to help them transition to cleaner energy jobs.

In your view, what strategy should teachers use to increase high school students' interest in learning? Please explain why you think this one particular strategy will be effective.",
    "student_1_name": "Kelly",
    "student_1_response": "I believe teachers should incorporate more group work activities into their lessons. While completing tasks in groups or teams, students will have an opportunity to share their opinions and learn from their peers.

Let's focus now on online classes, which are becoming more and more popular. In online classes, students communicate with their professors and other students completely online. Do you think that online classes offer advantages to both students and teachers that make them preferable to traditional in-person classes? Why or why not?",
    "student_1_name": "Paul",
    "student_1_response": "I believe online classes are preferable to traditional face-to-face classes, both for students and teachers. Because online classes allow more flexibility (for example, in terms of location and time), they better accommodate students and teachers with busy schedules. The quality of online classes has considerably improved, so online classes now present excellent learning options.",

One very important topic for educational policy involves what courses should be taught in schools.

The question I want you to discuss is whether new, innovative subjects should be taught in public schools.",

The main purpose of most courses in high school is to prepare students for higher education, and those basic requirements haven't changed.

    "student_1_response": "I enjoy art as much as anyone does, but public funds come from taxes, and I don't think taxpayers' hard-earned money should be spent on impractical or inessential items and services.

Petroleum, also known simply as oil, is one of the most important international commodities. When the global market price of oil goes up, fuels such as gasoline (petrol) also become more expensive. Many people think governments should step in to protect consumers from increases in fuel prices. What is your view? Do you think governments should actively keep fuel prices low for consumers?",
    "student_1_name": "Kelly",
    "student_1_response": "I think it's a good government policy. Most people have to drive or use public transportation, like a bus, to get to work. When the price of gasoline goes up, it costs them more to get to work. People don't have a choice about whether to go to work or not, so they should be protected from price increases.",
    "student_2_name": "Andrew",
    "student_2_response": "I think the government keeping gas prices low is a bad policy. The biggest problem we face now is global climate change.

Today, I would like to know what you think. Do you agree that the benefits of switching jobs often outweigh the disadvantages? Why or why not?",
    "student_1_name": "Kelly",

    "student_1_name": "Student",
    "student_1_response": "From my perspective, donating money locally would be a better choice. First, donating locally is less likely to cross out of the bound of one's actual financial ability. Donating locally tends to be less costly in comparison to globally because of its smaller range, meaning that money can be used more fully when distributing certain amount of money to a smaller area. In this way, donating locally can be achieved by many people such as college students who take a part-time job, or regular workers who hold strong social responsibility. However, it is always commercial leaders who possess hundreds of wealth would be capable of donating globally which may require the money several times than that of workers gain from his or her whole life. Second, donating locally would have a higher possibility of receiving feedback. Within donors community, their fame would increase because of the donation. When they need help, people would be willing to give a hand. However, donating globally seems too far from donors' lives, and those who benefit from the donation may not even know the name of the donor.",
    "student_2_name": "Student",
    "student_2_response": "In my opinion, donating to international organizations can create a more significant impact. While local donations are convenient, global organizations have the resources and expertise to address large-scale issues like climate change, pandemics, and poverty that transcend national borders. These organizations can pool donations from around the world to fund major projects that no single country could accomplish alone. Additionally, helping people in other countries promotes cross-cultural understanding and global solidarity. While local donations are valuable for immediate community needs, supporting international causes allows us to contribute to solutions that benefit humanity as a whole.",

    "student_1_response": "In my point of view, I believe that the school should also provide students with the opportunity of learning literature and analyzing fictional texts. First, it is true that students who have chosen scientific fields of study could easily find their ideal occupations in the future, but studying literature would also enable students to find a wide range of jobs. For example, literature majors could choose to become editors or writers in the publishers; they could also choose to become reporters because they are more skillful in delivering messages of ideas orally; they could also become teachers and impart knowledge to other students. Therefore, studying literature would also help students find suitable jobs in the future. Besides, learning fictional texts would enable students to develop a good reading habit, increasing their interest in terms of reading books.",
    "student_2_name": "David",
    "student_2_response": "From my point of view, schools should teach more practical, nonfiction texts. Firstly, practical texts are more useful in job hunting than fiction texts do, since practical texts would solely focus on providing knowledge and theories that can be applied to people's future work. Therefore, schools need to offer students practical knowledge in order to provide a chance for them to secure ideal jobs. Especially, in these days, there are lots of people craving for one job now and one person needs to be truly outstanding enough so that he or she needs to have the practical skills that can be used immediately in the workplace. Fiction may be enjoyable, but it does not prepare students for the realities of the job market.",

That is, students would not receive their high school diplomas until they provide evidence of doing volunteer work to serve their community; for example, they might distribute food to the needy and document how many hours they spent doing that. In your post, discuss whether you agree or disagree with the idea of requiring volunteer work for graduation and why you feel that way.",
    "student_1_name": "Claire",

We know that children are affected both positively and negatively by what they see and hear. Many parents allow their children to watch entertaining or educational videos on devices like smartphones or tablets. Overall, do you think watching a lot of online videos is harmful to children? Why or why not?",
    "student_1_name": "Andrew",
    "student_1_response": "I think watching online videos is harmful to children. Children under two years old need to develop communication skills by interacting with other people; passively watching videos exposes them to language, but it's not the same. Also, even for older children, sitting and staring at a device means they are not moving and exercising. I agree with Andrew that very young children who are learning to communicate should not watch a lot of videos. However, for children who are past that stage, videos can be great. Lots of kids' videos are about animals and nature. Most kids will never see a whale in its natural environment, but online, they can learn all about whales.",
    "student_2_name": "Aaire",
    "student_2_response": "From my point of view, young children shouldn't be exposed to online videos. First of all, watching online videos is not good for children's eyes. Since young children's eyes are still not fully developed and sensitive to long-term exposure to screens, the use of electronic devices will increase the risk of shortsightedness for young children, which will be clearly a significant drawback for their future life. Although some may argue that young children should be allowed to watch educational videos, the truth is that children's eye will be harmed by the screen of electronic devices regardless of what video they watch. In addition, addition to electronic devices is another crucial problem. Nowadays lots of apps have the mechanism that could send you the video that you'd like to watch, and children are likely to become indulged in it since their self-discipline skills are still not fully developed.",

TV may give us the basics or a broad overview, but books really dig deep into various subjects, offering a full understanding and expert insights. This lets readers see different viewpoints and helps them think more critically. As a result, they can form well-rounded opinions based on comprehensive information.",

Nowadays, with the development of Internet, almost everyone has a television in his or her home. During the free time, all people would choose watching TV as their best way of finding relaxation because it contains variety of recreational channels like argument channel, cartoon channel, shopping channel and so on. Through browsing through the TV, people sooth their pressure. On the contrary, reading books tend to further take people's energy because it's impossible to read without thinking, making it less appeal when it comes to free time. Besides, TV could benefit people's real life. Many of the TV channels contain advertisements, which are likely to encounter people's need. For example, my uncle has found his job when he noticed the employment advertisement on TV.

However, in recent decades, the pace of scientific and technological progress has increased dramatically, with new discoveries and inventions being developed almost every day. Some people think that this rapid progress in science and technology is beneficial for society overall and should be encouraged. Others believe this progress is happening too quickly and could create serious problems. Which view do you agree with, and why?",

Anyone with a serious medical condition hopes for rapid scientific progress.",

First, because these new technologies are not well developed yet, many negative impacts that people haven't thought about could exist. Our development of technology happened just a few hundred years ago, and it is still developing in a very fast speed. These will raise many concerns such as environmental issues, things could damage human health such as radiation and many more. Just like what happened during the Industrial Revolution, when people couldn't foresee the impact of greenhouse gases. Therefore, these underdeveloped and new technologies would cause more damage to people in the future if these rate isn't going to slow down. Furthermore, conflicts caused by technology are increasing, too. Due to the production of more variety of products, more and more resources are needed, which further forces the countries to fight over a certain raw material.

Do you agree? Why or why not?",

Businesses, for example, often spend a lot of money on scientific research in order to make a discovery that can lead to profit. Even if that discovery benefits everyone, the business has a right to keep the discovery secret so that it can develop a profitable product from the research. Sharing knowledge is crucially important to most scientists. Scientists usually publish the details of their discoveries in scientific journals, which means that everyone can see what the scientists have accomplished. Being recognized as the person who made a discovery is the biggest reward for any scientist. When scientists keep their discoveries secret, they lose that recognition. That is very unsatisfying.",

To begin with, the action of sharing scientific information would contribute to a faster development of the whole society. Many scientists would spend numerous hours working in their labs to conduct research and wait for the results; however, if other researchers have already finished the same kind of experiment upon the same subjects, it would save other scientists a great deal of time if the outcome of the experiment is to be shared.

Today, some educators believe that teachers should limit how much time they spend lecturing and instead teach by encouraging in-class discussions and having students work in groups. However, some teachers still teach primarily by lecturing. Do you believe lecturing is an effective teaching method? Why or why not?",

Socializing in smaller groups versus larger circles can have varying effects on one's health and happiness. Some argue that smaller groups foster deeper connections, allowing for more meaningful interactions and a sense of closeness. Conversely, larger friend circles offer diversity and exposure to different perspectives. Which do you think contributes more to a person's health and happiness: spending time with a close-knit few or a larger group of friends?",
    "student_1_name": "Andrew",
    "student_1_response": "Developing strong bonds with a few close friends fosters deeper connections and enhances emotional support. These intimate relationships often lead to increased trust and understanding, allowing for genuine empathy and shared experiences. Small friend groups offer a sense of security and authenticity in interactions, promoting mental well-being. For me, a closer, smaller social circle is better. The first reason is that small social circles foster close emotion supports. In a large social group, since everyone has to maintain their relationship with other group members, the opportunity of close communication between each team members will be very small. As a result, close emotional connection are not likely to form between team members in a large team. However, in a small social group, each team member will have enough time and chance to understand others, and whenever who needs an emotional support, other members could easily help him or her. In addition, living in a smaller group is more relaxing. Since we only need to contact a few members in a small social circle, the pressure of living in that group will be much less comparing to a large group, and we will be more relaxed as well.",

Numerous friendships provide a larger support network, creating opportunities for various activities and interests. Engaging with a larger group cultivates adaptability, social skills, and exposure to different cultures or ideas, contributing to personal growth. From my perspective, spending time with a larger group of friends contributes more to a person's health and happiness. The main reason is that larger group of friends creates more chances of sharing activities and obtaining thoughts. Since numerous friendships means numerous different individual thoughts and hobbies, we would expose ourselves to tremendous numbers of diverse communication and party. For instance, I could learn about philosophical ideas from my philosophy major friends or be informed with knowledge of physical perspective from my physics major friends. I could also go hiking with the people I met in a trip, or go fishing with friends known from my fishing class. There are numerous opportunities to try more engagements and gain relaxation.

On the other hand, there are concerns about the high cost of supporting the arts, and the argument that funding should be directed towards more practical and tangible improvements for the community, such as improving public facilities and infrastructure.

Nowadays, facilities are considered as one of the most imperative factors when it comes to the choice of residence. Many people would choose the city with premium facilities as their ideal living place because those facilities could guarantee living standard. If the government provides fund to a city's facility, it would make the city a tremendously appealing place to work and live, attracting sufficient labors to promote local economy. Besides, the increasing quality of facilities may improve tourism, further developing economic growth. On the contrary, funding art museums may not have such an obvious impact on the economy, since fewer people are interested in arts due to the higher level of pressure that people bear in modern life.",

Art and music museums house priceless collections that teach us about our ancestors, different civilizations, and the evolution of human creativity. Without proper funding, these invaluable artifacts could deteriorate or be lost forever. Additionally, museums provide unique educational opportunities that playgrounds and swimming pools cannot offer. Schools frequently organize field trips to museums to expose students to art, history, and culture, which broadens their perspectives and nurtures appreciation for the arts.

Some educators argue that online courses provide greater flexibility and accessibility, while others contend that the lack of face-to-face interaction significantly diminishes the educational experience. In your opinion, can online learning be as effective as traditional classroom instruction? Please explain your reasoning and support your position with specific examples.",
    "student_1_name": "Michelle",
    "student_1_response": "I believe online learning can be just as effective as traditional classroom instruction, if not more so in certain respects. The flexibility allows students to learn at their own pace and review materials as needed. Additionally, online courses often incorporate interactive elements like discussion forums and video demonstrations that can enhance understanding. Many students, particularly working adults, would not have access to quality education without online options.",

The interpersonal dynamics and spontaneous discussions that occur in person are essential to deep learning. Students benefit from immediate feedback and the ability to ask questions in real-time. Furthermore, the social aspect of college involves building networks and relationships that are difficult to develop virtually.",

  "Online Shopping Is Affecting Society？": {
    "topic": "Online Shopping and Its Effect on Society",
    "professor_prompt": "More and more, online shopping is becoming the primary way that many people obtain everyday goods. But what are the ramifications for the society in which we live? On the one hand, online shopping has advantages -for example, I can make a purchase without ever leaving my home. However, with fewer people shopping at local shops, in some places, these establishments are having a hard time competing. Do you think that online shopping is, on the whole, affecting society?",
    "student_1_name": "Paul",
    "student_1_response": "I think that online shopping has had negative impacts on society. In my city, many local stores have shelves filled with various products that you can find in online stores. This has forced some of them to close down, which not only affects the amount of tax revenue generated in our local community but also impacts the number of job opportunities available to the community members.",
    "student_2_name": "Kelly",
    "student_2_response": "It's unfortunate that some local stores are forced to close down, but that's the nature of competition. As consumers, we benefit greatly from online shopping due to lower prices. Even if I find a physical store that can compete with online sellers in terms of pricing, I am still likely to make the purchase online because it means I don't have to spend money on transportation to the store. From my point of view, online shopping has a positive influence on society overall. First of all, online shopping can enhance the economy. Online shopping allows customers to make purchases at their home rather than going to shops in person, and people will be more motivated to buy products online since the effort they need to spend on taking a walk to shops is saved. As a result, the economy will be enhanced by the online shopping services. For instance, readers may be reluctant to buy new books that are sold only in bookstores that are far away from them, but problems like that won't exist if they could buy them online. In addition, online shopping can save time for people. Since they don't need to travel to the physical stores to buy products, the time on the road will be saved, which will allow people to spend more time on other things, including academic works or pursuing their own interests.",

Many people migrate from rural areas to cities for economic reasons. However, some continue living in rural areas despite fewer job opportunities. For this discussion, please explain in a post what you think are the main reasons people choose to live in rural areas rather than moving to urban areas.",
    "student_1_name": "Elly",
    "student_1_response": "I believe a major reason some people choose to live in rural areas rather than urban centers is the quieter, slower-paced lifestyle. Rural living typically has less noise from traffic and crowds. The quiet allows more relaxation and connection with nature. The less hurried pace of rural life appeals to those wanting to escape the stress of urban environments.",
    "student_2_name": "Andrew",
    "student_2_response": "I think a major appeal of living in rural areas is the natural environment and air quality. The air tends to be cleaner and fresher with less pollution from factories, cars, and high population density. For people who value the ability to breathe fresh air, grow gardens, and spend time outdoors, rural living provides a healthier lifestyle. The scenic, less-congested environment offers a higher quality of life that can outweigh economic factors for some.",

    "student_1_name": "Andrew",
    "student_1_response": "In my opinion, governments should not charge drivers additional fees to drive during rush hours. Imposing such financial burdens on citizens, especially during peak commuting times, would create significant economic disadvantage for many working families. Many employees have no choice but to drive to work early in the morning or late in the evening, and adding extra costs would simply punish those who rely on their vehicles for livelihood. Furthermore, such policies would disproportionately affect lower-income workers who cannot afford alternative transportation options. Instead of penalizing drivers, governments should focus on improving public transportation infrastructure and expanding road capacity to genuinely address congestion issues.",
    "student_2_name": "Claire",
    "student_2_response": "As far as I'm concerned, governments should charge drivers for certain amount of fees to drive during rush hours. To begin with, as is known to all, traffic congestion is a serious social problem nowadays and many drivers are stuck on the road for a long time. By setting such a rule, many people will consider a lot before deciding whether they will drive their private cars or not. In this way, many citizens, especially the relatively less wealthy ones, will probably select an alternate way of transportation, such as the subway, due to their heavy financial burden. Moreover, the governments can earn money to solve the rushing hour problem more directly. For example, the government can use their budget to build additional roads in the city to support multiple choices for drivers in order to relieve traffic congestion.",

In today's discussion, I would like you to describe at least one advantage or disadvantage of being an early adopter. Please explain why you think this way.",
    "student_1_name": "Andrew",

We learned that some people believe that they get so much benefit from using a mobile app that they see no need to use any other method, such as attending a class led by a teacher. Others believe that using only a mobile app is not a very effective way to learn a foreign language well. In this discussion post, I would like you to indicate which of those views you support, and why.",
    "student_1_name": "Student 1",
    "student_1_response": "In my opinion, I believe that learning a foreign language only on a mobile app is not an effective way. To begin with, this lack of communication with people who are fluent could cause a hard time for people to understand the idioms. In a language, people would have to create their own idiom to describe things or to communicate efficiently. Talking to a person who is fluent in that language for example their teachers, could help people to better understand that culture and pick up different idioms during the conversation. However, if people just study it on a phone, they would have a hard time linking it to the knowledge they already have. Admittedly, it is true that people could learn all those vocabularies and grammar online easily, but it would be harder for them to remember comparing to having a class. Furthermore, many apps might contain errors that could cause a misunderstanding of knowledge. Nowadays, even the most well-developed app could have errors and bugs, which could decrease the quality and efficiency of learning the target language.",
    "student_2_name": "Andrew",
    "student_2_response": "An integral part of language learning from my point of view is practice, and what better way to practice than in a class, with classmates and a teacher? My classmates will probably all be at a similar proficiency level as me and are just as motivated as me to learn the language. I believe that mobile applications are probably the way to go when it comes to language learning. I do see the points made by my peer, but for me, the benefits of mobile apps are way better. For example, using a mobile app allows you to learn at your own convenience without the limitations of time and location that often characterize learning in a classroom with a teacher.",

When companies choose a location for a facility, they should think about whether it's a place that employees want to be. For example, locating a workplace in a big city where there are lots of shops and entertainment options could be a good way to attract new employees. It might sound unimportant at first, but I have heard of companies that provide their employees with a variety of food options in their facility. These companies don't just have a cafeteria; they also provide coffee bars and free snack stations for their employees to make working there more enjoyable. I think this also makes employees feel appreciated.",
    "student_2_name": "Claire",
    "student_2_response": "In my opinion, I believe that in order for a company to be attractive, it should develop a better working condition for the employees. First, comfortable working condition could help to increase their satisfaction level. For many people nowadays, earning money is no longer the essential goal, when they reach a certain income level the satisfaction they could get from the job is the one that matters. By increasing the working condition, the hygiene factor would be achieved, leading to greater happiness of the employees. The employees would also compare the working environment of all those companies when the salaries they receive is the same amount as from the company with better working condition would be more attractive. Furthermore, having this good working environment could help the old employees to give compliments to the company. When the old employees are satisfied of the working condition they would more likely to suggest the company to other people.

    "student_1_name": "Claire",

Some people think schools should spend more money on schoolteachers' salaries because, if the salaries improved, more qualified people will be attracted to the profession. Others believe the money should be spent on additional resources such as books and computers. Which viewpoint do you agree with?",
    "student_1_name": "Paul",

To begin with, it is known to all that the general salary for teachers is not in the same league as that for other industries such as finance or business. Therefore, many talented people would consider those more profitable occupations when deciding their careers. However, if the overall salary for teachers could be increased, more capable and competitive people would start choosing teachers as their professions. With more experts and professionals in education industry, the quality of students' courses will also be significantly boosted, which would in turn result in better academic performances among students. These students would have a bigger chance to make more valuable contribution to the whole society and make the world a better place. Admittedly, some people believe that spending money on additional resources is a good option, but raising teachers' salaries and encouraging them to do more research and improve their teaching skills would generate far more benefit than buying more advanced computers or books for students.",
    "student_2_name": "Kelly",
    "student_2_response": "I believe that additional resources for students are more important than raising teachers' salaries. For one thing, many students in schools do not have a good access to a wide range of information due to the lack of proper computers and books. It is the school's duty to install more equipment to facilitate students' studies. For example, students could learn more details about certain animals during biology class if they have a good projector to cast images; they could go comfortably to the schools' libraries to do their researches instead of going to other places if schools have a vast collection of books covering more topics and fields.

    "student_1_name": "Paul",

To start with, being a social media influencer means that they have to gain enough network traffic from users, so that they could sell products through their accounts. However, in order to gain such online exposure, some influencers might choose to display some reckless or even aggressive behaviors. For example, they might choose to record videos of fighting with people randomly on the street; or they might do some illegal things while doing livestreaming, such like a big livestreaming scandal uncovered in South Korea last year, where people were being manipulated.

One popular model of retail is \"superstores\"—very large stores, typically owned by corporations—that sell many kinds of different products. We will compare this business model to local retailers, typically small or specialized stores with local owners, such as a camera shop or a small neighborhood grocery store. Do you think it is more beneficial for people to shop at small local stores rather than at superstores? Why or why not?",
    "student_1_name": "Kelly",
    "student_1_response": "Shopping at small local stores benefits consumers in many ways. One of the benefits is that small stores often offer better services than large stores. For example, if you need your bicycle repaired, usually the small shop can do it right there in the shop. At the large stores, they have to send it to the manufacturer to be repaired. Although I understand the importance of shopping at small stores to support the local community, there are obvious benefits to shopping at superstores. Because large retailers procure products in bulk, they can offer their customers a wide variety of products, usually at low prices. So, by shopping at large stores, consumers get better value for their money.",
    "student_2_name": "Andrew",
    "student_2_response": "From my perspective, I don't think it's more beneficial for people to shop at small local stores rather than at superstores. To begin with, the local supermarket usually closes early, so its opening hours are not long enough to meet the requirements of most people. For instance, small local supermarkets are usually run by individuals, so we cannot guarantee that the shops will be open all day. Although some small supermarkets have a better service, just imagine, when we go to the small stores at midnight with no one to help, it would be even more inconvenient. In contrast, superstores not only operate all day, but also help us solve problems better since they have more staff to provide necessary aid for consumers. On top of that, superstores usually have a variety of goods. When people shop in a large supermarket, they usually buy more than they need to use. In that case, it decreases the number of times they go shopping, thus, reducing their chances of driving and reducing air pollution.",

    "professor_prompt": "In this course, we've been studying current events and discussing the value of being educated consumers of news. However, there is also an opinion that we should periodically limit our exposure to current events and even take breaks from the news. Do you think it is beneficial to take breaks from reading or watching the news for a period of a few days or weeks? Why or why not?",
    "student_1_name": "Claire",
    "student_1_response": "In my opinion, it is beneficial for people to take breaks from all the different news. First, it can reduce people's anxiety and stress levels. With the development of technology, many different kinds of news appear in people's daily lives. People are also being exposed to numerous negative news reports every day, which will easily affect people's moods and contribute to their stress and anxiety. Taking a break allows individuals to disconnect from the constant flow of information, and prioritize their mental well-being. In this way, they can be well prepared for new pieces of information they are facing, and reduce mental stress. Second, it can also improve people's productivity. News consumption is usually time-consuming, taking a break from reading news allows people to have more free time, and they can spend that time with more valuable uses to improve efficiency and productivity.",
    "student_2_name": "Andrew",
    "student_2_response": "Beneficial or not, it would be impossible. Today, we're exposed to the news everywhere—on our phones, on our computers, on big TV screens in waiting rooms and in airport lounges. To take a break from the news, you would have to withdraw from all activities in society, which is unrealistic. I think that taking a break from the news could be helpful psychologically. It obviously depends on how long a break we take. Completely avoiding watching or reading the news may be too extreme, but taking a short break from the news could help us avoid news stories that may affect us negatively.",

After finishing your undergraduate studies, do you prefer pursuing an advanced degree full-time or continuing work while studying part-time?",
    "student_1_name": "Andrew",
    "student_1_response": "I think it's better to go to college full-time instead of trying to balance part-time classes and a full-time job. For me, I know I wouldn't be able to focus on my studies if I was exhausted from work all the time. Full-time college allows me to put all my energy into my classes and get the most out of my education. Trying to do both college and work full-time seems way too stressful for me to handle. I'd rather get my degree done faster by being a full-time student.",
    "student_2_name": "Claire",

The classes feel more relevant when I'm able to apply the material to real work situations. Instead of just memorizing concepts, I get to see how they work in practice. And getting work experience while I study looks good on my resume. I think balancing the two helps me get more out of my classes and prepares me for my career at the same time.

In your response, you should do the following: Express and support your opinion. Make a contribution to the discussion in your own words. An effective response will contain at least 100 words. Dr. Diaz: Secondary or high school students (ages 14-18) who plan to attend university must begin thinking about what field of study they'll enter. Some students might be directed into certain fields by their parents and teachers. Others prefer to make their own choice based on their own interests and feelings. Do you believe that secondary school students should be allowed to choose their own field of study at university without being guided by parents and teachers? Why?",
    "student_1_name": "Kelly",
    "student_1_response": "I think it's a mistake to let students at that age make such an important decision on their own. They usually don't have the wisdom to choose appropriately. The people who know them best—their parents and teachers—will be more objective and give the best guidance. In my opinion, I believe that students who are currently studying in secondary school should not be allowed to choose their own field of study at university without any guide from parents or teachers. To begin with, many secondary students do not have a clear picture as to different field of studies, whereas teachers or parents, who are more experienced than young adolescents, would be equipped with more information and thus are able to make better choice. For example, professional teachers would know the future careers of studying different field, and they would thus inform students what it would be like in the future if they choose certain majors, helping them to understand the bigger picture. Besides, many parents would have a better understanding regarding their children's strength, making their advice on students' future majors far more useful and valuable. Therefore, secondary students should consult their parents or teachers about their future majors.",
    "student_2_name": "Andrew",
    "student_2_response": "Choosing a field of study, and perhaps a career in that field, based mainly on what others tell you to do seems wrong to me. My parents wanted me to study engineering, but I'm not interested in that; I want to help people learn. I know I'll struggle more financially as a teacher, but I'm sure I'll be happier. In my point of view, students studying in secondary school should have the opportunity to choose their future field of study. For starters, only students could know where their true interests lie, which is the reason why their own choice would be the best fit for themselves. For example, my cousin James is extremely interested in language studying, and he has started analyzing different languages in Europe at a young age. However, his parents forced him to study computer science as a college major, believing that this would increase his chance of securing a better job in the future. The consequence of this was that my cousin could not learn anything about his course work because he had absolutely no passion for this subject. Second, many children are able to acquire far more information regarding different subjects than before, thanks to the development of Internet. Such technology allowed for an easy availability for students to gain access to what it would be like if they choose certain field of study, enabling them to make great choice without being guided by parents or teachers.",

Consider the following question: When people spend a lot of time watching sports or following their favorite team, does it have a negative effect on their lives? Why or why not?",
    "student_1_name": "Claire",
    "student_1_response": "I agree that focusing on sports too much can have negative impacts. For example, some people who like watching sports on television have few other interests. In fact, it seems like watching sports is all they're interested in. I sometimes find such people annoying because they care too much about things that don't matter. I am not sure what we mean by spending \"a lot of time\" following sports. But following sports has helped me in life.

To begin with, many people would develop this addiction which could lead to more trouble due to the amount of time they spend on it. In modern society, it is easy for people to develop an addiction and be unaware of it due to the development of technology. Many people would sit on the sofa watching sports for the whole day and not feeling tired, which is a really bad habit. This unawareness could lead to conflict between families because they don't spend time with them; lack of exercise due to the amount of time they spend watching sports; or extreme expenditure like buying extreme amounts of sports events tickets. All of those would further damage them physically, financially, and socially. Furthermore, having this extreme affection toward sport could also cause conflict between people. Because many sports fans are quite extreme sometimes due to this strong support for their team, they could have conflicts with fans of other teams. This could lead to very extreme actions like riots and physical combats, that could damage the countries' reputation and individuals' health.",
