    "student_1_response": "In my point of view, I believe that the school should also provide students with the opportunity of learning literature and analyzing fictional texts. First, it is true that students who have chosen scientific fields of study could easily find their ideal occupations in the future, but studying literature would also enable students to find a wide range of jobs. For example, literature majors could choose to become editors or writers in the publishers; they could also choose to become reporters because they are more skillful in delivering messages of ideas orally; they could also become teachers and impart knowledge to other students. Therefore, studying literature would also help students find suitable jobs in the future. Besides, learning fictional texts would enable students to develop a good reading habit, increasing their interest in terms of reading books.",

Some experts propose that future businesspeople should focus on improving their sales techniques —after all, if you cannot sell your product, you will soon be out of business. Others believe that these future businesspeople would benefit most from learning management skills, such as how to lead teams and motivate employees. Which view do you agree with? Why?",
    "student_1_name": "Andrew",
    "student_1_response": "I think that management skills are most important. Sales tasks are something that a businessperson can delegate to a team of salespeople once the business gets going, so it is really important that the future businessperson develops skills to manage teams of people. Without that, it is not very likely that the business will grow.",

First of all, for students, studying at universities while working will have a negative impact on both their academic progress and their work at companies. To receive an advanced degree, students must take a number of challenging courses, and they will undoubtedly become extremely overwhelmed if they have a full-time job as well. This great amount of pressure will not only affect their academic performance but also influence their work. For instance, students like this may be asked to contact their customers the day before the exam, and circumstances like that will surely impose a great deal of pressure on them, or even further causing anxiety. In addition, it's not good for companies as well. Since students in the companies who still have to take classes at universities are not able to do as much work as other employers, recruiting students who are taking advanced degrees to work will decrease the companies' efficiency, which will eventually harm the profit.",

Let's focus now on the following viewpoint: it is no longer useful to spend many years pursuing a traditional, specialized university degree in a single field, such as communications or economics. Instead, it makes more sense for most people to complete several shorter certification programs and earn certificates in, for example, project management, computer programming, graphic design, and so on. Do you agree or disagree with this viewpoint? Why?",
    "student_1_name": "Andrew",
    "student_1_response": "I agree that completing short certification programs makes a lot of sense these days because people are more likely to change careers now than they were in the past. Certification programs allow people to quickly learn a variety of professional skills that are in demand at the moment. And acquiring such skills leads to more job opportunities.",
    "student_2_name": "Claire",

Since young children's eyes are still not fully developed and sensitive to long-term exposure to screens, the use of electronic devices will increase the risk of shortsightedness for young children, which will be clearly a significant drawback for their future life. Although some may argue that young children should be allowed to watch educational videos, the truth is that children's eye will be harmed by the screen of electronic devices regardless of what video they watch. In addition, addition to electronic devices is another crucial problem. Nowadays lots of apps have the mechanism that could send you the video that you'd like to watch, and children are likely to become indulged in it since their self-discipline skills are still not fully developed.",

Our development of technology happened just a few hundred years ago, and it is still developing in a very fast speed. These will raise many concerns such as environmental issues, things could damage human health such as radiation and many more. Just like what happened during the Industrial Revolution, when people couldn't foresee the impact of greenhouse gases. Therefore, these underdeveloped and new technologies would cause more damage to people in the future if these rate isn't going to slow down. Furthermore, conflicts caused by technology are increasing, too. Due to the production of more variety of products, more and more resources are needed, which further forces the countries to fight over a certain raw material.

    "student_1_name": "Student 1",
    "student_1_response": "I believe that taxing fuel and using the revenue to subsidize electricity is a reasonable policy approach. By making fuel more expensive, the government can encourage people to reduce their fuel consumption, which would help protect the environment. Additionally, subsidizing electricity costs would make it more affordable for families and businesses to use energy. This could be especially helpful for low-income households that struggle to pay their electricity bills.",

    "student_2_response": "While I understand the reasoning behind this policy, I think it may not be the most effective approach. Taxing fuel heavily could place a significant financial burden on people who rely on vehicles for their daily commute or work, such as delivery drivers or construction workers. Instead, the government should invest in extra training programs for workers in fossil fuel industries to help them transition to cleaner energy jobs.

During the free time, all people would choose watching TV as their best way of finding relaxation because it contains variety of recreational channels like argument channel, cartoon channel, shopping channel and so on. Through browsing through the TV, people sooth their pressure. On the contrary, reading books tend to further take people's energy because it's impossible to read without thinking, making it less appeal when it comes to free time. Besides, TV could benefit people's real life. Many of the TV channels contain advertisements, which are likely to encounter people's need.

However, this brings a series of problems in the long run: those food from commercialized companies often involves unhealthy oil and ingredients which adds heavy burdens on our digestive system and even blood circulation; moreover, those foods are often cold and simple dishes that provides limited nutrition to our body. Therefore, if this habit continues over a period of time, our body would suffer from serious digestive problems and nutrition shortages, which would then lead to further illnesses. A great way to improve this bad habit is to buy fresh ingredient and cook on daily basis.

When a teacher explains a topic, continuity would be very important, which could help the students to link those points together. Discussing one whole part would also help the students to feel more excited by slowly revealing the connections. For example, when studying biology class, the students will be excited to understand how DNA would link to the production of protein and further to how life functions. If there are constant interruptions caused by activities, it would be very unhelpful for the students' understanding because of the gap between each point. Furthermore, students would learn important skills while listening to lectures. Lectures require students to have self-learning skills and fast interpretation, which would be essential for their future studies.

To begin with, the action of sharing scientific information would contribute to a faster development of the whole society. Many scientists would spend numerous hours working in their labs to conduct researches and wait for the results; however, if other researchers have already finished the same kind of experiment upon same subjects, it would save other scientists a great deal of time if the outcome of the experiment is to be shared. Therefore, all scientists could have more time focusing on more pressing subjects and topics. Second, such behavior would also encourage more people to participate in scientific world, since a lot of data and key information are easily available in the shared community.",

    "student_1_response": "From my perspective, I believe that company should employ experienced workers. The main reason is that hiring experienced workers could benefit companies more than hiring young ones. Hiring young workers who have no experience would lead to the cost on training. Young workers must undergo training for at least several weeks before they could formally participate in company's project, which is both time and money consuming. However, experienced workers don't need such training since they have been trained before in previous jobs, rendering them more adaptive and productive, and therefore reducing the cost. Moreover, experienced workers are more likely to be sophisticated in negotiating with their colleagues because they have contacted with variety of people in previous jobs, equipping them with excellent ability to cooperate and get on well with others. On the contrary, young workers are usually not mature enough to be as sophisticated as those experienced workers, which may lead to problems when it comes to the collaboration within the company. For example, immature young workers may begin a fierce argument with his or her colleagues, which would definitely impede the cooperation and therefore reduce the working efficiency.",

To begin with, the living cost or expense of people dwelling in rural areas is far less than that of people in big cities. For those who have settled in metropolis, they would have so many things to worry about: high rent, commuting cost, increasing housing prices, or even higher item prices in grocery stores. However, for people choosing to live in the countryside, they would not have to rack their brains to deal with all those high living costs everyday, which, from my perspective, is the main reason why many people start settling down in the rural areas. In addition, regions in rural areas are indeed less polluted and the air quality there is much better than that in cities. Many factories have been emitting pollutants into the air or even river for many years, leading to lower air quality in cities: hazy days are very common in major cities in recent years.",

To begin with, adding an environmental tax on air travel would lead to serious implications to both air travel companies as well as individual passengers. After imposing the environmental tax on airline companies, these companies would have to pay additional fees to the government. In order to compensate such extra cost, the companies might have to raise the price of the airplane tickets, creating additional financial burden for passengers. Besides, higher ticket price might discourage passengers from using airplane as a means of transportation, which would in turn hurt the profits of airline business, leading to high unemployment rate or lower salaries for workers in those companies. Besides, imposing more environmental tax would not allow planes to burn less fossil fuel, which is the main cause for air pollution!",

In a large social group, since everyone has to maintain their relationship with other group members, the opportunity of close communication between each team members will be very small. As a result, close emotional connection are not likely to form between team members in a large team. However, in a small social group, each team member will have enough time and chance to understand others, and whenever who needs an emotional support, other members could easily help him or her. In addition, living in a smaller group is more relaxing.

    "student_1_response": "In my point of view, there are several disadvantages to being an early adopter. Firstly, being a new adopter to always buy the company's newest product can cost a person more money than waiting to buy it later. This is because the new products just launched by the company are usually more expensive, and the price would like to drop along time. For example, the iPhones are about 10 thousand RMB at first since it is brand new with updated designs and functions. However, as more and more people buy it, the marginal profit of the product gets more and more, along with the devaluation of electronic devices due to the fast development of technologies and the fact that the materials it is being made of are consumable. This will lead to a continuous decline in the price of the iPhone. Such is the disadvantage of being an early adopter. Moreover, trying the latest product can contain not only high prices but high risks on the usage experience. The fact that the product is new means whether the product is good or not is uncertain.

Writing down tasks not only aids in organizing and prioritizing daily or weekly goals, but it also combats the natural human tendency towards procrastination. Personally, I have noticed a significant improvement in my productivity since I started documenting my tasks. It is true that I do not forget important tasks, which used to be a frequent issue for me. This method also aligns with what I have observed in professional settings: for instance, my father mentions that his company maintains detailed tasks lists, enhancing their overall efficiency. Thus, I advocate for the use of to-do lists as they can be a substantial aid in both academic and professional environments.",

    "student_1_response": "From my perspective, I believe factories should make more efforts than individuals when it comes to environmental protection. The main reason is that the environmental issues should be counted on industries more than on the individual. The industries could generate million tons of wasted materials and products overnight because of massive production. The quantity of wasted materials being produced is far more numerous than that of individuals. For example, I cannot produce even a pound of junks within a week. However, the volume of wasted materials made by industries can be as massive as a mountain within days. Therefore, as long as the industries undertake the responsibility of protecting environment, the amount of waste can be reduced dramatically. In addition, waste produced by industries is more harmful than that produced by individuals. Many chemical industries generate poisonous substances, which would be poured into rivers for disposal and might turn the whole river into a brown and red liquid line, killing thousands of living organisms, whose existence depends on its living environment.",

When there are no online reviews, people can't find a place to refer to others' appraise, so they can only look at the company's descriptions about that product. But in order to attract more customers, a company will usually exaggerate the strength of a product, and ignore the drawbacks. Then, we can't know the comprehensive description of an item, and buy it without knowing the flaws. Second, it can help companies to improve their products and services.

    "student_1_name": "Student",
    "student_1_response": "From my perspective, donating money locally would be a better choice. First, donating locally is less likely to cross out of the bound of one's actual financial ability. Donating locally tends to be less costly in comparison to globally because of its smaller range, meaning that money can be used more fully when distributing certain amount of money to a smaller area. In this way, donating locally can be achieved by many people such as college students who take a part-time job, or regular workers who hold strong social responsibility. However, it is always commercial leaders who possess hundreds of wealth would be capable of donating globally which may require the money several times than that of workers gain from his or her whole life. Second, donating locally would have a higher possibility of receiving feedback. Within donors community, their fame would increase because of the donation. When they need help, people would be willing to give a hand. However, donating globally seems too far from donors' lives, and those who benefit from the donation may not even know the name of the donor.",
    "student_2_name": "Student",
    "student_2_response": "In my opinion, donating to international organizations can create a more significant impact. While local donations are convenient, global organizations have the resources and expertise to address large-scale issues like climate change, pandemics, and poverty that transcend national borders. These organizations can pool donations from around the world to fund major projects that no single country could accomplish alone. Additionally, helping people in other countries promotes cross-cultural understanding and global solidarity. While local donations are valuable for immediate community needs, supporting international causes allows us to contribute to solutions that benefit humanity as a whole.",

For instance, some people might do random interviews on the street, and use cameras to record the process and post it on online platform. Such behavior would disturb other people's daily life and many influencers are posting their videos without any consent.

However, if the overall salary for teachers could be increased, more capable and competitive people would start choosing teachers as their professions.

These students would have a bigger chance to make more valuable contribution to the whole society and make the world a better place.

For example, electronic devices, appliances, and vehicles require constant attention and regular maintenance. Possessions also need to be stored and organized, taking up time and space. For these reasons, some people argue that having many possessions can actually decrease the quality of life. Do you agree or disagree? Why?",

    "student_1_name": "",
    "student_1_response": "From my perspective, I don't think it's more beneficial for people to shop at small local stores rather than at superstores. To begin with, the local supermarket usually closes early, so its opening hours are not long enough to meet the requirements of most people. For instance, small local supermarkets are usually run by individuals, so we cannot guarantee that the shops will be open all day. Although some small supermarkets have a better service, just imagine, when we go to the small stores at midnight with no one to help, it would be even more inconvenient. In contrast, superstores not only operate all day, but also help us solve problems better since they have more staff to provide necessary aid for consumers. On top of that, superstores usually have a variety of goods. When people shop in a large supermarket, they usually buy more than they need to use. In that case, it decreases the number of times they go shopping, thus, reducing their",

Moreover, it will also promote a relaxed atmosphere in the workplace leading to a better work experience and results. Some people might say doing the same amount of work within four days will cause an increase on people's working pressure on every single work day. However, the four-day workweek will lead to a higher working efficiency on each work day.

As a result, we are more likely to be recruited by a better company with a higher salary, and we will have enough money to do other thing, like tour. However, if we choose to take a job before completing an advanced degree, we will be less competitive comparing to others who have completed their degrees, which means that we might end up with an undesirable job. In addition, taking a job will disturb our studies as well, since we can no longer put our full time into our studies.",

To begin with, many secondary students do not have a clear picture as to different field of studies, whereas teachers or parents, who are more experienced than young adolescents, would be equipped with more information and thus are able to make better choice. For example, professional teachers would know the future careers of studying different field, and they would thus inform students what it would be like in the future if they choose certain majors, helping them to understand the bigger picture. Besides, many parents would have a better understanding regarding their children's strength, making their adivce on students' future majors far more useful and valuable.

In this way, the teacher's teaching quality might decrease, and have a negative impact on students' academic performance. Also, when students need extra play time, the number of teachers might not be enough so the school needs to hire extra teachers, which will be another expense.

To begin with, many people would develop this addiction which could lead to more trouble due to the amount of time they spend on it. In modern society, it is easy for people to develop an addiction and be unaware of it due to the development of technology. Many people would sit on the sofa watching sports for the whole day and not feeling tired, which is a really bad habit. This unawareness could lead to conflict between families because they don't spend time with them; lack of exercise due to the amount of time they spend watching sports; or extreme expenditure like buying extreme amounts of sports events tickets. All of those would further damage them physically, financially, and socially. Furthermore, having this extreme affection toward sport could also cause conflict between people. Because many sports fans are quite extreme sometimes due to this strong support for their team, they could have conflicts with fans of other teams. This could lead to very extreme actions like riots and physical combats, that could damage the countries' reputation and individuals' health.",

    "student_1_response": "From my perspective, the most important factor for employers to consider when deciding where employees should work is the time cost. The main reason is that time determines profits. When office is too far from employees' home, they may have to spend hours on commuting, which means they may have to get up quite early if employers requires them to reach the company, and that is an obviously unreasonable option. Under that situation and considering the time cost, employers would find that allowing employees to work at home would enable companies to produce more each day because employees receive more rest by saving the time spent on traveling long distance to the company, prompting their working efficiency. In this way, the whole company could be more productive, increasing the profit.",
