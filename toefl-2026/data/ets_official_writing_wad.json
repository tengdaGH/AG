      "student_1_name": "Student A",
      "student_1_response": "Yes, I think high schools should require volunteer hours because it helps students build a sense of civic responsibility.

Some have part-time jobs or take care of younger siblings after school. Adding a mandatory volunteer requirement could create extra stress and make it harder for those students to balance their existing responsibilities.",
