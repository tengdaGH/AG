CHAPTER 2: READING SECTION
Reflections Through Time 
Mirrors have fascinated humans for millennia, serving as practical tools and objects of mystery.  
The earliest mirrors, crafted from polished obsidian or metal, date back over 6,000 years. These early 
devices provided only dim, distorted reflections, but they were (begin highlight) prized (end highlight) for their rarity and symbolic 
power. In some ancient cultures, mirrors were believed to reveal hidden truths or act as portals to 
other worlds. 
The invention of glass mirrors in the first century C.E. marked a turning point. By the Renaissance, 
Venetian artisans had perfected the technique of coating glass with a thin layer of metal, producing 
clear, bright reflections. This innovation made mirrors more accessible and transformed their role 
in society. [A] Mirrors became essential in art, allowing painters to study their own features for self-
portraits. [B] They also played a part in scientific discovery, as telescopes and microscopes relied 
on reflective surfaces to reveal the unseen. [C] The spread of affordable mirrors changed daily life, 
influencing (begin highlight) fashion, architecture, and even ideas about selfhood (end highlight). [D] 
Today, mirrors are everywhere—from vehicles and satellites to lasers and quantum experiments.  
Their evolution reflects advances in technology and shifts in how we see ourselves. 
Directions: Now answer the questions. 
14. The word (begin highlight) “prized” (end highlight) in the passage is closest in meaning to 
A. valued 
B. rare 
C. broken 
D. hidden 
15. What can be inferred about the impact of glass mirrors on society? 
A. They made mirrors less important in daily life. 
B. They led to new uses for mirrors in art and science. 
C. They replaced all metal objects. 
D. They were only used by royalty. 
16. According to the passage, what was one use of mirrors in scientific discovery? 
A. To create jewelry 
B. To build bridges 
C. To improve telescopes and microscopes 
D. To make coins

CHAPTER 2: READING SECTION
Practice Set 1 Answers and Explanations 
Questions 1–10. 
Rainforests constitute a vital component of Earth’s biogeochemical systems, exerting significant 
influence over atmospheric regulation and thermal balance. They are full of tall trees and plants that 
use sunlight to make food. This process also takes carbon dioxide out of the air, which helps to keep 
our planet cool. When trees are cut down, the amount of heat-trapping gases in the air can increase, 
making the planet warmer. The sustained conservation of rainforest biomes is crucial for ensuring 
climatic homeostasis on a planetary scale. 
Explanation 
 The missing words in this paragraph are completed using both environmental context and sentence 
structure. Words like trees, plants, use, and food describe the biological activity taking place in 
rainforests. These choices are supported by the topic and the verbs that follow. 
Function words such as are, of, and to help establish relationships between ideas and maintain 
sentence flow. In the third sentence, process, takes, and out describe how rainforests contribute 
to climate regulation. These words fit naturally into the sentence and help explain the role of  
carbon absorption. 
11. D — This is a Negative Factual question. The question asks you to identify an activity that is  
not mentioned in the advertised experience. All of the bullet points in the “Why You’ll Love It” section 
are relevant. 
The event includes a scenic walk, free health screenings, and wellness workshops, but cooking 
demonstrations are not mentioned in the advertisement. Therefore, Choice D correctly identifies an 
activity that is NOT included in the advertised experience. 
• Choices A, B, and C, are incorrect because they merely paraphrase aspects of the first three 
bullet points respectively and thus are mentioned in the advertised experience. 
12. D — This is a Vocabulary question. The word “scenic” appears in the phrase describing the walk 
as “scenic,” which suggests it is visually appealing. The context of a wellness walk along the waterfront 
implies a pleasant and attractive environment. Choice D, “beautiful,” is the best match and therefore 
correct for this meaning. 
• Choices A, B, and C — “difficult,” “dangerous,” and “expensive” — are incorrect because they do 
not fit the context and would not make sense in describing a wellness walk.
3064020100305f06092a864886f70d010701301e060960864801650304012e3011040c84ee114e87059056de0e218702011080324a5569a7f5756f23a7b4b96fc08bd1e158952bce8c1c8cde660a4f59

13. C — This is a Reference question. The word “participants” refers to those who take part in the 
Global Wellness Walk. The sentence is part of the advertisement’s “Awesome Giveaways” bullet point, 
which states that the first 200 participants will receive a water bottle and wellness kit. Choice C is 
therefore correct. 
• Choices A, B, and D — health professionals, event organizers, and staff at snack stations — are 
incorrect because they are not the ones receiving the giveaway. Only those who join the walk 
are described as “participants.” 
14. A — This is a Vocabulary question. The passage says that early mirrors were “prized for their 
rarity and symbolic power.” This suggests that they were highly appreciated or considered important. 
Choice A, “valued,” matches this meaning and is therefore correct. 
• Choice B is incorrect because rarity is one reason mirrors were prized, but “rare” is not what 
“prized” itself means. 
• Choice C is incorrect because “broken” contradicts the idea of being prized. 
• Choice D is incorrect because “hidden” is unrelated to the meaning of “prized.” 
15. B — This is an Inference question, which asks you to identify information that is implied but 
not directly stated. The passage describes how glass mirrors became clearer and more accessible, 
which allowed painters to use them for self-portraits and scientists to use them in telescopes and 
microscopes. These examples suggest that the invention of glass mirrors expanded their applications 
beyond decoration or symbolism. Therefore, the correct answer, choice B, is that they led to new uses 
in art and science. 
• Choice A is incorrect because the idea that glass mirrors made mirrors become less important 
contradicts the passage. 
• Choice C is incorrect because the idea that glass mirrors replaced all metal objects is not 
supported by the passage. 
• Choice D is incorrect because the idea that glass mirrors were only used by royalty is not 
supported by the passage. 
16. C — This is a Factual question, which asks about a detail explicitly stated in the passage.  
The second paragraph mentions that mirrors played a part in scientific discovery, specifically in 
telescopes and microscopes. These instruments rely on reflective surfaces to function, making  
Choice C the correct answer. 
• Choices A, B, and D — creating jewelry, building bridges, and making coins — are incorrect 
because they are not mentioned in the passage.
3064020100305f06092a864886f70d010701301e060960864801650304012e3011040c84ee114e87059056de0e218702011080324a5569a7f5756f23a7b4b96fc08bd1e158952bce8c1c8cde660a4f59

CHAPTER 2: READING SECTION
17. D — This is a Rhetorical Purpose question, which asks why the author included specific 
information. The phrase “fashion, architecture, and even ideas about selfhood” appears in a sentence 
discussing how affordable mirrors changed daily life. These examples show the wide-ranging impact of 
mirrors beyond their practical uses. The correct answer, Choice D, is that the author is illustrating the 
broad influence of mirrors on society. 
• Choice A is incorrect because the information, as well as the sentence it is contained in, does 
not include any details about how mirrors were made. 
• Choice B is incorrect because the information and the sentence it is contained in suggest that 
mirrors have been very important in daily life. 
• Choice C is incorrect because the information and the sentence it is contained in make a point 
about mirrors in daily life, different from the point made earlier in the paragraph about mirrors 
and artists. 
18. A — This is an Insert Text question, which asks where a new sentence best fits in the passage. 
The sentence refers to a development that allowed clearer self-reflection. In the passage, sentence A 
discusses the invention of glass mirrors and how they produced clear, bright reflections. Inserting the 
sentence after A, choice A, makes logical sense because it elaborates on the impact of clearer mirrors. 
Choice A is therefore correct. 
• Choices B and C are incorrect because they follow sentences about specific uses of mirrors; 
they are each somewhat far removed from the personal clarity idea. 
• Choice D is incorrect because it follows a sentence about the broader societal effects of 
mirrors; these are later consequences, far removed from the personal clarity idea.
3064020100305f06092a864886f70d010701301e060960864801650304012e3011040c84ee114e87059056de0e218702011080324a5569a7f5756f23a7b4b96fc08bd1e158952bce8c1c8cde660a4f59

Early Cinema 
The cinema did not emerge as a form of mass consumption until its technology evolved from the 
initial “peepshow” format to the point where images were projected on a screen in a darkened theater. 
[A] In the peepshow format, a film was viewed through a small opening in a machine that was created 
for that purpose. [B] Thomas Edison’s peepshow device, the Kinetoscope, was introduced to the 
public in 1894. (begin highlight) It was designed for use in Kinetoscope parlors, or arcades, whi
ch contained only a few individual machines and permitted only one customer to view a short, 
50-foot film at a time. (end highlight) [C] The first Kinetoscope parlors contained five machines. For the price of 25 cents (or 5 cents 
per machine), customers moved from machine to machine to watch five different films (or, in the 
case of famous prizefights, successive rounds of a single fight). [D] These Kinetoscope arcades were 
modeled on phonograph parlors, (begin highlight) which (end highlight) had proven successful for Edison several years earlier. In the 
phonograph parlors, customers listened to recordings through individual ear tubes, moving from one 
machine to the next to hear different recorded speeches or pieces of music. The Kinetoscope parlors 
functioned in a similar way. 
Directions: Now answer the questions. 
14. Which of the sentences below best expresses the essential information in the  
highlighted sentence? Incorrect choices change the meaning in important ways or leave out 
essential information. 
A. The Kinetoscope was designed so that customers could watch films in their homes. 
B. Kinetoscope parlors were large arcades where people could watch movies with friends. 
C. Kinetoscope parlors allowed many customers to watch long films together on several machines. 
D. The Kinetoscope was made for parlors that had a small number of machines, and each machine 
could show a short film to one person at a time. 
15. According to the passage, how did customers experience films in Kinetoscope parlors? 
A. By moving from one machine to another to view different short films 
B. By attending group screenings in large, darkened theaters 
C. By listening to recorded speeches through ear tubes 
D. By watching several films at once on a large screen 
16. What does the word (begin highlight) “which” (end highlight) refer to? 
A. Kinetoscope arcades 
B. Edison 
C. Phonograph parlors 
D. Several years earlier

Practice Set 2 Answers and Explanations 
Questions 1–10 
Mushrooms are a diverse group of fungi that thrive in a wide range of natural and cultivated 
environments, such as wooded areas and landscaped gardens. They are unique because they do not 
make their food like plants do. Instead, mushrooms absorb nutrients from the soil and dead plants. 
The most conspicuous anatomical feature of a mushroom is the cap, which constitutes its uppermost 
section. Beneath this structure are intricate, lamella-like ridges referred to as gills, where microscopic 
reproductive units are produced. These units enable the dissemination and ecological colonization of 
mushrooms across environments conducive to fungal growth. 
Explanation 
The missing words are completed using biological context and sentence structure. Words like do, 
make, food, and plants highlight how mushrooms differ from plants in their method of obtaining 
nutrients. 
Function words such as are, because, and instead help establish contrast and explanation. Later, 
absorb, from, and soil describe the alternative process mushrooms use to gather nutrients, fitting 
smoothly into the sentence’s structure. 
11. B — This is a Vocabulary question. In the context of the Course Overview, students are expected 
to “analyze case studies,” which means they will examine them in detail to understand environmental 
messaging. “Study carefully,” Choice B, is correct because it best captures this meaning. 
• Choices A, C, and D — “ignore,” “copy,” and “summarize briefly” — are incorrect because they do 
not fit the context and would misrepresent the course’s academic expectations. 
12. D — This is a Negative Factual question, which asks you to identify something that is not 
mentioned in the syllabus. The syllabus indicates that assignments such as reflections, quizzes, and 
group projects are associated with particular topics. However, there is no mention of an assignment 
associated with the topic Community Engagement. The correct answer therefore is choice D, 
“Community Engagement.” 
• Choices A, B, and C are incorrect because each is explicitly listed with an assignment. 
13. B — This is an Inference question. The syllabus mentions “Reflection #1” and “Group Project 
Topic,” indicating that students will complete both individual and group assignments. The correct 
answer, choice B, reflects this inference. 
• Choice A is incorrect because the class meets at a specific location. 
• Choice C is incorrect because assignments are due via the course portal —  
not during class time.

14. D — This is a Sentence Simplification question, which asks you to choose the option that best 
captures the essential meaning of the highlighted sentence. The original sentence explains that the 
Kinetoscope was designed for parlors with only a few machines, and each machine allowed one 
person to view a short film. Choice D accurately preserves both key ideas: the limited number of 
machines and the individual viewing experience. Choice D is therefore correct. 
• Choice A is incorrect in that it distorts the meaning by suggesting home use, which is not in the 
highlighted sentence. 
• Choice B is incorrect because it implies group viewing and therefore contradicts the  
highlighted sentence. 
• Choice C is incorrect because it suggests that many customers watched long films together, 
which is the opposite of “one person” and “short film.” 
15. A — This is a Factual question, which asks about a detail explicitly stated in the passage. The text 
explains that customers paid 25 cents to move from machine to machine, each showing a short film. 
This makes Choice A the correct answer. 
• Choice B is incorrect because it describes a later format of cinema, not the peepshow model. 
• Choice C is incorrect because it refers to phonograph parlors, not film viewing. 
• Choice D is incorrect because it misrepresents the technology, which did not involve large 
screens or simultaneous viewing. 
16. C — This is a Reference question, which asks you to identify what a pronoun or relative pronoun 
refers to. In this sentence, “which had proven successful for Edison” refers to “phonograph parlors,” the 
last noun before the relative clause. The sentence explains that Kinetoscope arcades were modeled 
after phonograph parlors, which had already been successful. Choice C is therefore correct. 
• Choices A, B, and D are incorrect because they refer to broader or unrelated elements  
in the sentence. 
17. B — This is a Rhetorical Purpose question, which asks why the author included a specific 
comparison. The passage explains that Kinetoscope parlors were modeled on phonograph parlors, 
where customers listened to recordings individually. This comparison highlights that the idea of using 
machines for solo entertainment was already familiar to audiences. The correct answer, choice B, 
reflects this purpose. 
• Choice A is incorrect because the passage does not emphasize differences between viewing 
films and listening to music. 
• Choice C is incorrect because the passage does not emphasize popularity. 
• Choice D is incorrect because the passage does not emphasize Edison’s 
motivation for invention.

18. C — This is an Insert Text question, which asks where a new sentence best fits in the passage. 
The sentence summarizes the nature of the Kinetoscope experience — brief and solitary. Choice C 
follows a sentence describing how customers moved from machine to machine to watch short films 
individually. Inserting the sentence here logically connects the description of the viewing format with 
its social implications. Choice C is therefore correct. 
• Choice A is incorrect because details about the brief, solitary nature of the Kinetoscope 
experience do not follow logically from a sentence about the emergence of cinema as  
an art form. 
• Choice B is incorrect because details about the viewing experience in “these parlors” do not 
follow logically from a sentence that does not mention parlors. 
• Choice D is incorrect because the preceding sentence emphasizes the number of films that 
could be watched, not the brief, solitary experience of Kinetoscope viewing.

Invitation 
Greetings from a former student! 
I am reaching out on behalf of the Green City Sustainability Council, where 
I am an intern this semester, to invite you to participate in our new 
Community Urban Beekeeping Initiative, launching this spring. The 
program aims to support local biodiversity by establishing rooftop beehives 
across several city buildings, while also providing relevant educational 
workshops. 
As a participant, you would receive hands-on training from certified 
apiarists, all necessary equipment, and ongoing support throughout the 
season. The initiative will culminate in a community honey-harvest event in 
September, where participants can share their experiences and celebrate 
their contributions to urban ecology. 
If you are interested in joining or would like more information, please reply 
to this email by March 15. Thank you for considering this opportunity to 
make a positive impact on our city’s environment.

CHAPTER 2: READING SECTION
Impact of Railroad Transportation in the United States 
Both the steamboat and the railroad system with its steam-powered trains revolutionized transport 
in the United States in the nineteenth century. Entire regions that would hardly have been touched, 
especially in the West, were opened up to settlement and exploitation. 
[A] In a geographic sense, the impact of the steamboat and railroad was simply (begin highlight) immense (end highlight). [B] Some 
historians have argued further that they were the key to the rapid economic growth experienced by 
the United States in the middle decades of the century. [C] The railroad, especially, not only lowered 
transport costs but caused a surge in the output of the iron, coal, and engineering sectors. [D] Thus, it 
was a driving force in economic development. 
The impact on local economies could be huge. Many towns began as division points where trains 
changed their crews and steam locomotives were resupplied with water. Others became industrial 
centers because the railroad linked them to materials and markets. Farmers who would otherwise 
have been limited to a local market were able to specialize in crops best suited to their soil and 
climate. (begin highlight) On the other hand, those towns and regions without access by rail
 to coal suffered competitively in the age of steam. (end highlight)
Directions: Now answer the questions. 
14. The word (begin highlight) “immense” (end highlight) in the passage is closest in meaning to 
A. limited 
B. enormous 
C. gradual 
D. temporary 
15. All of the following are mentioned in the passage as contributions of the railroad to 
economic development EXCEPT 
A. establishing national banking regulations 
B. lowering transport costs 
C. increasing output in iron, coal, and engineering 
D. serving as a driving force in overall development

Practice Set 3 Answers and Explanations 
Questions 1–10. 
The night sky has fascinated humans for centuries, leading to numerous discoveries about our 
universe. Stars, planets, and galaxies are observed using telescopes, which magnify distant 
objects. Many astronomers study star formations to learn about the origins of the universe. By 
analyzing the light emitted from stars, scientists can determine their composition and age. This 
exploration helps us understand the complex nature of cosmic development and our place within it. 
Explanation 
The missing words are completed using astronomical context and sentence structure. Words like 
planets, galaxies, and objects describe the celestial bodies being studied. These choices are 
guided by the topic and the descriptive flow. 
Terms such as observed, telescopes, and magnify explain how these bodies are examined, while 
astronomers, star, to, and about describe who conducts the research and what they aim to learn. 
These words fit naturally into the sentence and help maintain clarity and progression. 
11. B — This is a Factual question, which asks you to identify a detail explicitly stated in the email. The 
second paragraph of the email states that participants will receive “hands-on training from certified 
apiarists, all necessary equipment, and ongoing support.” This confirms that equipment is provided. 
Choice B is therefore correct. 
• Choices A, C, and D are incorrect because they are not mentioned in the email: There is no 
reference to a stipend, transportation, or a city-issued certification. 
12. A — This is a Rhetorical Purpose question, which asks why the author included a specific detail. 
The mention of the honey harvest event comes after describing the training and support participants 
will receive. It serves to highlight a celebratory and rewarding conclusion to the program, likely 
intended to motivate potential participants. Choice A is therefore correct. 
• Choices B, C, and D are incorrect because the email does not mention ticket sales, training start 
dates, or hive installation locations in connection with the harvest event. 
13. C — This is a Reference question, which asks you to identify what a phrase refers to in context. 
The sentence appears at the end of the email, following a description of the initiative and an invitation 
to participate. The phrase “this opportunity” clearly refers to the chance to join the beekeeping 
initiative. Choice C is therefore correct. 
• Choices A, B, and D are incorrect because they refer to specific events or actions that are part of 
the program (e.g., the harvest event, choice A) or unrelated (e.g., donating, choice B: or visiting as 
a guest, choice D).
3064020100305f06092a864886f70d010701301e060960864801650304012e3011040c84ee114e87059056de0e218702011080324a5569a7f5756f23a7b4b96fc08bd1e158952bce8c1c8cde660a4f59

14. B — This is a Vocabulary question. The word “immense” appears in the sentence: “In a 
geographic sense, the impact of the steamboat and railroad was simply immense.” The context 
suggests that the impact was very large or significant. “Enormous” is the best synonym in this context. 
Choice B is therefore correct. 
• Choices A, C, and D — “limited,” “gradual,” and “temporary” — do not match the meaning or 
tone of the sentence and would contradict the idea of a major transformation. 
15. A — This is a Negative Factual question, which asks you to identify the one item that is not 
mentioned in the passage. The passage discusses how railroads lowered transport costs, increased 
output in iron, coal, and engineering, and served as a driving force in economic development. However, 
there is no mention of banking regulations. The correct answer is choice A, “establishing national 
banking regulations.” 
• Choices B and C are incorrect because they are explicitly supported by the third sentence in the 
second paragraph. 
• Choice D is incorrect because it is explicitly supported by the final sentence in the  
second paragraph. 
16. C — This is a Select the Sentence question, which asks you to identify the sentence that 
describes the railroad’s impact on related industries. Sentence C states: “The railroad, especially, 
not only lowered transport costs but caused a surge in the output of the iron, coal, and engineering 
sectors.” This sentence directly explains how the railroad influenced other industries. Choice C is 
therefore correct. 
• Choice A is incorrect because it focuses only on broad economic impact. 
• Choice B is incorrect because it also only focuses on broad economic impact. 
• Choice D is incorrect because it makes a broad historical interpretation and does not mention 
specific industries. 
17. D — This is an Inference question, which asks you to identify information that is implied but not 
directly stated. The passage says that railroads allowed farmers to specialize in crops best suited to 
their soil and climate, which implies that before rail access, farmers were limited to growing a variety of 
crops for local consumption. The correct answer, choice D, reflects this inference. 
• Choice A is incorrect because it contradicts the final sentence of the passage. 
• Choice B is incorrect because the passage never mentions canals at all. 
• Choice C is incorrect because it contradicts the point made in the third sentence  
of the final paragraph.

18. C — This is a Sentence Simplification question, which asks you to choose the option that best 
captures the essential meaning of the highlighted sentence: “On the other hand, those towns and 
regions without access by rail to coal suffered competitively in the age of steam.” The correct answer, 
choice C, preserves the key ideas: lack of rail access to coal and resulting economic disadvantage. 
• Choice A is incorrect because it distorts the meaning by exaggerating the claim. 
• Choice B is incorrect because it misrepresents the cause and effect. 
• Choice D is incorrect because it introduces a comparison not supported by the passage.

Water and Ocean Life 
The physical and chemical properties of water, unsurprisingly, determine much about life in the ocean. 
(begin highlight) Water is dense (high mass per unit of volume), about 840 times as dense 
as air—roughly as dense as most life forms, as they are primarily made of water. (end highlight) This means that marine organisms 
fight no battle with gravity and possess none of the structures that we need on land to combat it. 
In the ocean, there are no tree trunks. The closest analogy would be the stipes (stalks) of the large 
seaweeds known as kelp, allowing kelp to form “forests.” But these stipes do not hold the kelp up— 
they just hold it in place. At low tide, the kelp collapses. 
[A] Likewise, marine animals can have flexible skeletons or no skeleton at all. [B] This makes it much 
easier to become large. [C] The major problem with the density of the ocean comes in the depths, 
where the weight of all that seawater bears down, creating (begin highlight) enormous pressures. (end highlight) [D] Related to 
density is viscosity—or, basically, thickness due to internal friction. It is about 60 times easier to move 
through air than water. 
Directions: Now answer the questions. 
14. Which of the following sentences best expresses the essential information in the 
highlighted sentence? Incorrect choices change the meaning in important ways or leave out 
essential information. 
A. Water is less dense than air, which is why most living things float easily. 
B. Water and air have about the same density, but most life forms are much denser than water. 
C. Water is much denser than air and has a similar density to most living things because they are 
mostly made of water. 
D. Water is about 840 times denser than air, but most life forms are made mostly of air. 
15. According to the passage, what is one reason marine animals do not need the same 
supportive structures as land animals? 
A. Marine animals are much smaller than land animals. 
B. Water reduces the effects of gravity on marine animals’ bodies. 
C. The thicker skin of marine animals provides sufficient support. 
D. Animals that live in the water have more bones. 
16. Which of the following statements is NOT true about kelp and supportive structures? 
A. Kelp can form “forests.” 
B. Kelp collapses at low tide.

Questions 1–10 
Fossils are the preserved remains of ancient organisms that provide a window into Earth’s distant 
past. They are typically found in sedimentary rocks and can include bones, shells, or imprints. By 
studying fossils, scientists can reconstruct the appearance and behavior of extinct species. Fossil 
records reveal the gradual changes that have occurred over millions of years, illustrating the process 
of evolution. This evidence helps us comprehend how life on Earth has transformed over time. 
Explanation 
The missing words are completed using scientific context and sentence structure. Words like 
found, sedimentary, shells, and imprints describe where fossils are located and what they consist 
of. These choices are supported by the topic and the descriptive detail. 
Function words such as are, and, and include help organize the sentence and list examples. 
Later, studying, scientists, and reconstruct describe the process of fossil analysis and its role in 
understanding extinct species. 
11. C — This is a Vocabulary question. The instructions state that the photo “must not exceed  
10 MB in size.” In this context, “exceed” means to go beyond a limit. “Be more than.” Choice C is 
therefore correct. 
• Choices A, B, and D — “replace,” “depend on,” and “be equal to” — are incorrect because they do 
not fit the meaning in this context and are not synonymous with exceed. 
12. D — This is a Reference question. The sentence appears in the final step of the submission 
process. The instructions are directed at the person submitting a photo, so “You” refers to that 
individual. Choice D is therefore correct. 
• Choices A, B, and C — “The festival staff,” “The contest judges,” and “the website administrators” 
— are not the intended audience of the instructions and are therefore incorrect. 
13. B — This is an Inference question. The instructions detail steps for uploading a photo, completing 
an online form, and receiving email confirmation. These steps suggest that the contest is conducted 
online. Choice B is therefore correct. 
• Choice A is incorrect because there is no mention of mailing entries. 
• Choice C is incorrect because there is no indication that the contest is  
restricted to professionals. 
• Choice D is incorrect because contest participants are explicitly instructed to  
title their submissions.

CHAPTER 2: READING SECTION
14. C — This is a Sentence Simplification question. The highlighted sentence explains that water is 
about 840 times denser than air and that most life forms are similarly dense because they are made 
mostly of water. The correct answer, choice C, preserves both key ideas: the comparison between 
water and air and the similarity between water and living organisms. 
• Choice A is incorrect because it contradicts the highlighted sentence in stating that water is less 
dense than air. 
• Choice B is incorrect because it also contradicts the highlighted sentence in stating that water 
and air have about the same density. 
• Choice D is incorrect because it falsely claims that life forms are made mostly of air and leaves 
out important information from the highlighted sentence. 
15. B — This is a Factual question. The passage explains that water is much denser than air and that 
marine organisms are primarily made of water. Because of this, they do not struggle against gravity 
the way land animals do. As a result, they do not need rigid support structures like tree trunks or heavy 
skeletons. Choice B is correct because it reflects this idea. 
• Choice A is incorrect because it contradicts the point made in the second sentence of the 
second paragraph about the size of marine animals. 
• Choice C is incorrect because the passage does not discuss or mention the skin of  
marine animals. 
• Choice D is incorrect because although the passage mentions that marine animals can have 
flexible skeletons or no skeletons, there is no explicit mention of the number of bones. 
16. D — This is a Negative Factual question, which asks you to identify the statement that is not true 
according to the passage. The passage states that kelp stipes hold the kelp in place but do not keep it 
upright. In fact, it says that kelp collapses at low tide. Therefore, the correct answer is that kelp stipes 
hold the kelp upright at all times, which contradicts the passage. Choice D is therefore correct. 
• Choice A is incorrect because the passage indicates that kelp can form forests. 
• Choice B is incorrect because the passage indicates that kelp collapses at low tide. 
• Choice C is incorrect because the passage indicates that stipes hold kelp in place, a subtle but 
crucial difference from holding kelp upright at all times.
3064020100305f06092a864886f70d010701301e060960864801650304012e3011040c84ee114e87059056de0e218702011080324a5569a7f5756f23a7b4b96fc08bd1e158952bce8c1c8cde660a4f59

17. A — This is a Select the Sentence question. Sentence A states: “Likewise, marine animals can 
have flexible skeletons or no skeleton at all.” This explains why it is easier for marine animals to grow 
large — because they do not need rigid support structures. The lack of skeletal constraints allows for 
greater size. Choice A is therefore correct. 
• Choice B is incorrect because although it states that marine animals can become large, it does 
not explain why. 
• Choice C is incorrect because the point it makes about pressure is not directly related to why 
marine animals can become large. 
• Choice D is incorrect because the point it makes about viscosity is not directly related to why 
marine animals can become large. 
18. B — This is a Rhetorical Purpose question. The passage first discusses how water’s density 
helps marine animals avoid the need for support structures. Then it contrasts this advantage with 
a challenge: the enormous pressure in deep water. The author uses this contrast to show that while 
water supports large size and buoyancy, it also presents difficulties at great depths. Choice B is 
therefore correct. 
• Choice A is incorrect because the passage does not claim that marine lifeforms avoid 
deep water. 
• Choice C is incorrect because the passage does not discuss the chemical properties of 
seawater and how these affect salinity. 
• Choice D is incorrect because the discussion of kelp makes a separate, distinct point made 
earlier in the passage.

Something magical is happening on campus! 
Have you seen the new public pianos popping up in the 
parks and plazas around campus? Yesterday, I stumbled 
upon one at Willow Square and ended up listening to an 
impromptu jazz session with fellow students and staff 
members. 
It's all part of the "Play Me, I'm Yours" project going on 
around town, inviting anyone—no matter your skill 
level—to sit down and share a song. How fun it is to see 
the project on campus! 
The best part? Local artists, including students here at 
the university, have decorated each piano, using paints 
to make each one a unique piece of art. I even met a 
retired professor who played a lullaby she wrote for her 
grandchildren. If you're looking for a little inspiration or 
just a break between classes, stop by and play a tune! 
Tag your piano moments with #CityPlaysTogether.

CHAPTER 2: READING SECTION
Frederick Taylor and United States Industry 
By the twentieth century, making workers more “cost-efficient” had become the single most important 
management goal in large-scale industries. Everywhere in industrial America, managers were drafting 
work rules and designing tasks with an eye to increasing worker output. The leading supporter 
of productivity was Frederick Winslow Taylor, (begin highlight) whose (end highlight) time-and-motion studies revolutionized the 
industrial workplace and whose writings had unquestionable authority among industrial engineers 
and factory managers. Taylor was obsessed with order and efficiency. 
[A] In the iron and steel factories that Taylor visited during the 1870s and 1880s, he saw only disorder 
and inefficiency on shop floors where skilled workers controlled the rhythms and division of labor. [B] 
Taylor believed that scientific study could break down the industrial process into its simplest parts, 
which, once understood, would allow managers to increase production and lower costs by reducing 
unnecessary motion and workers. [C] In his most famous demonstration, Taylor designed fifteen kinds 
of ore shovels, each for a specific task and each to be used in a specific way. [D] He was able to show 
that 140 men could do the work of 600. (begin highlight) The company thereupon fired the “e
xcess” shovelers, cutting its ore-shoveling costs by half. (end highlight) It also gave the remaining shovelers a raise in salary. 
Directions: Now answer the questions. 
14. What is this passage mainly about? 
A. How Taylor’s scientific approach reshaped the United States industrial productivity  
and labor practices 
B. The history of iron and steel manufacturing in the United States during the late  
nineteenth century 
C. Reasons managers restricted skilled workers’ autonomy to improve quality 
D. The evolution of ore-shoveling tools in heavy industry 
15. What can be inferred about managers in large-scale United States industries by  
the early twentieth century? 
A. They focused primarily on improving worker morale rather than production metrics. 
B. They prioritized standardizing tasks to raise output and reduce costs. 
C. They allowed skilled workers to set their own pace to maximize quality. 
D. They opposed analytical studies of work because such studies slowed production.

Practice Set 5 Answers and Explanations 
Questions 1–10. 
The concept of consciousness is central to philosophical debates about the nature of the mind. 
Consciousness refers to the awareness of one’s thoughts, sensations, and surroundings. 
Philosophers have long questioned whether consciousness can be fully explained by physical 
processes or if it transcends material explanations. Some argue that consciousness is an emergent 
property of complex neural networks, while others suggest it may involve nonphysical dimensions. 
This ongoing inquiry continues to challenge our understanding of human cognition. 
Explanation 
The missing words are completed using both philosophical context and sentence structure. Words 
like refers and thoughts help define the concept of consciousness and its components. These 
choices are guided by the topic and the descriptive flow of ideas. 
Function words such as the, of, and and support sentence cohesion and clarify relationships 
between ideas. Philosophers, long, and whether introduce the debate and its duration, while  
can and fully reflect the central question of whether consciousness can be explained through 
physical means. 
11. B — This is a Factual  question, which asks you to identify a detail explicitly stated in the post. 
The second paragraph mentions that “local artists, including students here at the university, have 
decorated each piano, using paints to make each one a unique piece of art.” This confirms that artists 
have contributed to the project by painting the pianos. Choice B is therefore correct. 
• Choice A is incorrect because music lessons are not mentioned in the post. 
• Choice C is incorrect because the post does not mention any contest. 
• Choice D is incorrect because the post does not mention a registration requirement. 
12. C — This is a Vocabulary question. The word “impromptu” appears in the sentence describing a 
jazz session that happened unexpectedly at Willow Square. The context suggests that the music was 
unplanned and informal. “Spontaneous,” Choice C, is therefore correct. 
• Choices A, B, and D — “scheduled,” “private,” and “competitive” — are incorrect because 
they do not fit the context and would misrepresent the nature of the event; they are also not 
synonymous with “impromptu”.

13. D — This is a Rhetorical Purpose question, which asks why the author included a specific  
detail. The mention of the retired professor and her lullaby illustrates how the piano project 
encourages meaningful interactions and emotional connections. The correct answer, choice D,  
reflects this purpose. 
• Choice A is incorrect because the post does not compare the project to music performed in 
concert halls. 
• Choice B is incorrect because the post emphasizes that there is no restriction on participation 
in the project. 
• Choice C is incorrect because the project described in the post is not a formal music workshop. 
14. A — This is a Factual question that asks about the main idea of the passage. The passage 
focuses on Frederick Winslow Taylor’s time-and-motion studies and how they influenced industrial 
management, particularly in increasing productivity and reducing labor costs. It describes Taylor’s 
observations, his scientific methods, and their impact on factory operations. The correct answer, 
choice A, summarizes this central theme. 
• Choice B is incorrect because it neglects to mention the innovations of Frederick Winslow Taylor 
and thus misrepresents the focus of the passage. 
• Choice C is incorrect because while the passage mentions that skilled workers originally 
controlled the rhythms of labor, it does not explore the reasons managers restricted workers’ 
autonomy or focus on improving quality. The idea is too narrow and not supported by the text. 
• Choice D is incorrect because it merely focuses on one example in the passage, not the overall 
point of the passage. 
15. B — This is an Inference question, which asks you to identify information implied but not directly 
stated. The passage explains that managers were designing tasks to increase worker output and 
reduce inefficiency, aligning with Taylor’s principles. This suggests that standardization and cost-
efficiency were key priorities. Choice B is therefore correct. 
• Choice A is incorrect because the passage never mentions morale or worker satisfaction. 
• Choice C is incorrect because the passage indicates the opposite; Taylor’s system restricted 
worker autonomy by the early twentieth century. 
• Choice D is incorrect because the passage indicates that managers embraced Taylor’s time-
and-motion studies.
3064020100305f06092a864886f70d010701301e060960864801650304012e3011040c84ee114e87059056de0e218702011080324a5569a7f5756f23a7b4b96fc08bd1e158952bce8c1c8cde660a4f59

CHAPTER 2: READING SECTION
16. D — This is a Reference question, which asks you to identify what the word “whose” refers 
to. The sentence begins by naming Taylor as the leading supporter of productivity, and the clause 
“whose time-and-motion studies…” provides more information about him. Therefore, “whose” refers to 
Frederick Winslow Taylor, and therefore choice D is correct. 
• Choices A, B, and C are incorrect because they are mentioned later in the sentence and are not 
the subject being described. 
17. A — This is a Sentence Simplification question, which asks you to choose the option that best 
captures the essential meaning of the highlighted sentence: “The company thereupon fired the 
‘excess’ shovelers, cutting its ore-shoveling costs by half.” The correct answer, choice A, preserves both 
key ideas: the dismissal of excess workers and the resulting cost reduction. 
• Choice B is incorrect because it distorts the meaning in stating that all shovelers were fired. 
• Choice C is incorrect because it also distorts the meaning by reversing the action. 
• Choice D is incorrect because it summarizes a different sentence — the one that follows the 
highlighted sentence. 
18. B — This is an Insert Text question, which asks where a new sentence best fits in the passage. 
The sentence expresses Taylor’s belief that skilled workers should not control production decisions. 
Choice B is correct because it follows a sentence describing Taylor’s belief in scientific study to 
improve efficiency, making it the most logical place to insert a sentence that elaborates on his critique 
of traditional labor practices. 
• Choice A is wrong because the sentence that follows focuses on what Taylor saw, not why he 
objected to what he saw. 
• Choices C and D are incorrect because the sentences that follow are about the shovel 
experiment and results — too far into the example for the inserted sentence to fit without 
breaking the flow.

Review: Night at the Table 
Looking for an unforgettable evening on campus? Once a 
month, Night at the Table turns dining into theater inside the 
university's historic main dining hall. This innovative 
dinner-theater, developed and staffed by students from the 
drama department, invites guests to become part of an 
unfolding story. Costumed hosts guide visitors into a candlelit 
hall, where each table serves as a stage. 
The evening unfolds over a five-course meal, each dish tied to 
a different act. Actors move among the tables, delivering lines 
and engaging guests, who are drawn into the plot. The menu 
complements the drama, with each course introduced by a 
theatrical monologue.

The Distribution of Plants and Animals 
There is a much greater similarity between the flowering-plant floras of different continents—South 
America, Africa, Asia, and Australia—than between the mammalian faunas (animals) of these regions. 
Only in the comparison between Africa and Asia do the plant and animal (begin highlight) figures, (end highlight) in terms of diversity 
and presence, reach a comparable level. Three factors seem to have caused these differences. [A] 
First, the families of flowering plants evolved and dispersed earlier than the families of mammals. 
[B] Secondly, there has been more extinction and replacement during the history of mammals than 
during that of flowering plants. [C] Finally, of course, not all floral similarities were merely the result of 
early dispersal across insignificant barriers rather than a later colonization across wider gaps. [D] The 
extent of the spread of flowering plants across the Pacific shows clearly that they can cross even quite 
wide stretches of ocean, especially where intermediate island stepping stones were available. 
For all these reasons, it is not surprising that the floras of the different continents show more 
similarities to one another than do their mammalian faunas. (begin highlight) This contrast 
between plant and animal distributions underscores the importance of evolutionary tim
ing and dispersal mechanisms in shaping global biodiversity patterns. (end highlight)
Directions: Now answer the questions. 
14. What is this passage mainly about? 
A. Why flowering plants show greater cross-continental similarity than mammals 
B. Why mammals evolved differently on separate continents 
C. How island chains facilitate plant dispersal across oceans 
D. How extinction events have eliminated mammals more often than plants 
15. Which continent is NOT listed among those being compared for flowering-plant floras? 
A. South America 
B. Africa 
C. Australia 
D. Europe 
16. The word (begin highlight) “figures” (end highlight) in the passage is closest in meaning to 
A. people 
B. shapes 
C. numbers 
D. illustrations

Practice Set 6 Answers and Explanations 
Questions 1–10 
Industrialization marked a significant turning point in modern history, leading to profound social and 
economic changes. As factories emerged, cities expanded rapidly, drawing people from rural 
areas. This urban migration brought new challenges, including overcrowded living conditions and 
environmental pollution. The industrial era also sparked technological innovations that transformed 
transportation and communication. Despite these advances, the period prompted critical debates 
over workers’ rights and the ethical implications of industrial growth. 
Explanation 
The missing words in this paragraph are completed using a mix of contextual meaning and 
grammatical structure. Words like factories, cities, rapidly, and people reflect the historical 
setting and describe the pace and direction of change. Rural contrasts with urban expansion and 
helps clarify the source of migration. 
This and migration work together to refer back to the movement described earlier, maintaining 
cohesion across sentences. Toward the end, new, including, and living introduce the 
consequences of industrial growth, supported by the sentence’s structure and the buildup of ideas. 
11. C — This is a Reference question, which asks you to identify what a pronoun refers to in context. 
The sentence appears at the beginning of the review, immediately after the name of the dinner theater 
experience, “Night at the Table.” The phrase “This innovative dinner theater” clearly refers to the named 
experience, with the demonstrative adjective “This,” in particular, pointing to the entire event. Choice C 
is therefore correct. 
• Choice A is incorrect because it refers to the broader location of the dinner theater experience, 
not the dinner theater itself. 
• Choice B is incorrect because it refers to the specific location of the dinner theater experience, 
not the dinner theater itself. 
• Choice D is incorrect because it refers to a specific activity within the dinner theater, not the 
entire event itself.

CHAPTER 2: READING SECTION
12. A — This is an Inference question, which asks you to identify information that is implied but not 
directly stated. The review explains that each course is inspired by a different act in the story, with 
actors saying their lines as they move among the tables. This suggests that the menu is not just food 
— it is part of the performance. The correct answer, choice A, reflects this integration. 
• Choice B is incorrect because it contradicts information in the passage; the menu is five 
courses, not three. 
• Choice C is incorrect because the passage does not indicate that the menu changes every night 
based on guest input. 
• Choice D is incorrect because it contradicts information in the passage; the menu items are 
served during the performance. 
13. D — This is a Rhetorical Purpose question, which asks why the author included a specific 
detail. The “hidden clue” game is described as one of the highlights of the evening, occurring between 
courses and contributing to the immersive experience. It exemplifies how guests are actively involved 
in the unfolding drama. The correct answer, choice D, reflects this purpose. 
• Choice A is incorrect because the passage does not criticize the pacing of the meal; the game is 
presented as a feature, not a complaint. 
• Choice B is wrong because there is no tone of warning in the passage, and nothing suggests that 
participation is required. 
• Choice C is wrong because the passage does not mention other theaters or make comparisons. 
14. A — This is a Factual question that asks about the main idea of the passage. The passage 
compares the global distribution of flowering plants and mammals and explains why plants tend to 
be more similar across continents. It presents three reasons for this pattern: earlier evolution and 
dispersal of plants, lower extinction rates, and the ability of plants to cross oceans. The correct answer, 
choice A, summarizes this central theme. 
• Choice B is wrong because it is too narrow; the passage mentions mammals only to contrast 
with plants, not to explain their evolution in detail. 
• Choice C is wrong because it is too specific; it provides one example, not the overall point; the 
passage mentions island chains and ocean crossings as an illustration of one factor. 
• Choice D is also wrong because it is too specific; the passage mentions extinction and 
replacement in mammals as one of three factors, but the main idea is broader.

15. D — This is a Negative Factual question. The first sentence of the passage lists South America, 
Africa, Asia, and Australia as the continents being compared. Europe is not mentioned. Therefore, the 
correct answer is Europe, choice D. 
• Choices, A, B, and C — ”South America,” Africa,” and “Australia” — are incorrect because they 
are all explicitly named in the passage. 
16. C — This is a Vocabulary question. The sentence says that “Only in the comparison between 
Africa and Asia do the plant and animal figures, in terms of diversity and presence, reach a comparable 
level.” In this context, “figures” refers to statistical data or quantities being compared — specifically, 
the number of plant and animal families. “Numbers,” choice C, is therefore correct because it is  
best synonym. 
• Choices A, B, and D — “people,” “shapes,” and “illustrations” — are incorrect because they do not 
fit the context and are therefore not contextually synonymous with figures. 
17. D — This is a Select the Sentence question. Sentence C introduces the idea that some floral 
similarities may be the result of flowering plants moving across wide areas into new regions. Sentence 
D then provides the specific evidence: “The extent of the spread of flowering plants across the Pacific 
shows clearly that they can cross even quite wide stretches of ocean, especially where intermediate 
island stepping stones were available.” Since sentence D provides direct evidence that floral 
similarities can result from long-distance dispersal, choice D correct. 
• Choice A is incorrect because the sentence talks about early evolution and dispersal, not long-
distance dispersal. 
• Choice B is incorrect because it focuses on extinction and replacement in mammals. 
• Choice C is incorrect because it introduces the idea that similarities are not only from early 
dispersal, but it does not give concrete evidence of long-distance dispersal. 
18. B — This is a Sentence Simplification question. Choice B is correct because it preserves both 
key ideas: (1) the contrast in distribution patterns and (2) the role of evolutionary timing and dispersal 
in shaping biodiversity. 
• Choice A is incorrect because it oversimplifies the highlighted sentence by not mentioning 
timing and dispersal. 
• Choice C is incorrect because it contradicts the main point of the highlighted sentence: the 
contrast between plant and animal distributions. 
• Choice D is incorrect because it focuses only on extinction, ignoring timing and dispersal, thus 
misrepresenting the highlighted sentence.

Emma Lee 
I can’t believe I’m already halfway through my exchange 
semester in Japan. Time really flies when you have a busy class 
schedule! Last weekend, after wrapping up midterms, I finally 
headed out of Osaka. My destination? Kyoto. 
Day 1: Temples and Shrines: I started my day at the Fushimi 
Inari Shrine, famous for its thousands of torii gates. It was a 
steep climb, but the view was absolutely worth it. Later, I visited 
the Kinkaku-ji, the Golden Pavilion, which was stunning, with its 
gold-leaf-covered exterior reflecting on the tranquil pond. 
Day 2: Exploring Gion Kobu, one of Kyoto's historic districts, 
was fascinating. I walked through the narrow streets lined with 
traditional wooden teahouses. The atmosphere was magical, 
and it seemed as if I was stepping back in time. 
I'll share more about Kyoto. Stay tuned for updates!

CHAPTER 6: TOEFL iBT® PRACTICE TEST — READING
Ancient Aqueducts 
Aqueducts are among the most impressive engineering (begin highlight) feats (end highlight) of ancient civilizations. [A] Aqueducts 
are structures built to transport water from a distant source to cities and towns. [B] The Romans, in 
particular, perfected the construction of aqueducts, using gravity to carry water over long distances. 
[C] Roman aqueducts were made of stone, brick, and concrete and included tunnels, bridges, and 
pipes. [D] The aqueducts were essential to the growth and sustainability of Roman cities. They 
supplied water for public baths, fountains, households, and agriculture. One famous example is the 
Pont du Gard in France. Built in the first century A.D., it spans 50 kilometers and features a three-tiered 
bridge that remains standing today. 
Aqueducts were not unique to the Roman Empire. Ancient Greece, Persia, and India also developed 
systems for water transport. Persian aqueducts, known as qanats, were underground channels 
tapping groundwater sources. These systems were exceptionally durable and could last for centuries. 
However, constructing and maintaining aqueducts required significant resources and labor. Despite 
these challenges, aqueducts were essential investments in ancient infrastructure and played a crucial 
role in development. 
26. The word (begin highlight) “feats” (end highlight) in the passage is closest in meaning to 
A. examples 
B. achievements 
C. skills 
D. investments 
27. Why does the author mention public baths, fountains, households, and agriculture? 
A. To imply that the construction of Roman aqueducts required a lot of effort 
B. To indicate that Roman cities needed more water than aqueducts could provide 
C. To emphasize the rapid growth and impressive sustainability of Roman cities 
D. To explain the usefulness of Roman aqueducts 
28. What specific ancient structure is mentioned in the passage as still existing today? 
A. A tunnel 
B. A bridge 
C. A fountain 
D. A channel

CHAPTER 6: TOEFL iBT® PRACTICE TEST — READING
Advancements in Renewable Energy Engineering 
[A] Photovoltaic (PV) cells that convert sunlight into electricity are one innovative solution to harness 
renewable energy. [B] When sunlight hits the PV cell, it is absorbed by a semiconductor material, 
usually silicon. The energy from the light knocks electrons loose from atoms, creating a flow of 
electric current. This current is then captured and can be used to power electrical devices. A common 
misconception is that, at night, PV cells store energy like a battery. [C] In fact, they convert sunlight 
into electricity in real time; to store energy, a separate energy storage system, like a battery, is required. 
[D] Researchers are also developing what are called moonlight solar panels, which can generate 
electricity at night, during rain, and under overcast skies. They make renewable energy a more (begin highlight) viable (end highlight) 
option in diverse environments. 
Floating wind farms are another interesting innovation. Mounted on buoyant platforms tethered to 
the ocean floor, they can be deployed far from land, where wind speeds are often stronger and more 
consistent than those on land. Underwater cables transmit electricity they generate back to shore. 
While challenges such as maintenance and initial costs persist, the long-term benefits are substantial. 
31. According to the passage, what does NOT occur inside PV cells? 
A. Silicon or another material absorbs sunlight. 
B. Electrons become less tightly bound to atoms. 
C. A flow of electric current is captured. 
D. Electricity is stored in a battery. 
32. What does the author indicate about moonlight solar panels? 
A. They are more efficient and cost-effective than traditional PV cells. 
B. They can function in low-light conditions. 
C. They can be used to store energy over a long period of time. 
D. They do not convert energy in real time. 
33. The word (begin highlight) “viable” (end highlight) in the passage is closest in meaning to 
A. practical 
B. predictable 
C. valuable 
D. adaptable

CHAPTER 6: TOEFL iBT® PRACTICE TEST — READING
Urbanization and Social Geography 
Urbanization is the transformation of rural areas into urban ones. [A] Social geography studies 
these changes and helps us understand urbanization’s implications on human societies. Unlike 
geography, which examines landscapes, climates, and natural hazards, social geography focuses 
on the interaction between society and landscapes. The term “social geography” was first used by 
French geographer Élisée Reclus and by followers of the French sociologist Frédéric Le Play, possibly 
independently of each other, at the end of the nineteenth century. [B] 
As cities grow, they attract people from rural areas seeking employment and better living conditions. 
This migration leads to higher population densities, affecting social relationships and community 
structures. Dense populations can foster anonymity, as the sheer number of people in urban 
environments often reduces the likelihood of repeated interactions with the same individuals. [C] 
Cities offer better access to healthcare, education, and public services than rural areas. [D] However, 
this concentration can lead to (begin highlight) disparities, (end highlight) with some urban residents benefiting more than others. 
Social geography seeks solutions to ensure equitable resource distribution. 
Cities are melting pots, bringing together people from various backgrounds. This diversity can enrich 
urban life but also presents challenges in integration and social cohesion. Social geographers analyze 
cultural dynamics and propose measures to enhance inclusivity. 
11. Why does the author mention Élisée Reclus and Frédéric Le Play? 
A. To identify the origins of social geography as a field of study 
B. To suggest that social geography has evolved significantly over the years 
C. To contrast the differences between geography and social geography 
D.  To explain the existence of two independent schools of thought  
within the field of social geography

On the next page is a table that converts your Reading practice section total into a TOEFL iBT® Reading 
scaled score. Take the total of raw points from your Answer Key/Self-Scoring Chart for both modules 
and find that number in the Raw Point Total column of the table. The Scale Score column of the table 
provides the equivalent TOEFL iBT® Reading score for each number of raw points. An equivalent CEFR 
(Common European Framework of Reference for Languages) Level is also shown. 
For example, if the Raw Point Total from your Answer Key is 23, the table shows a Scale Score of 4. 
Each Scale Score maps to an equivalent CEFR Level. The CEFR Level for a Raw Point Total of 23 is B2. 
You should use your Scale Score and CEFR level estimate as a general guide only. Your actual score on 
the TOEFL iBT® test may be higher or lower than your score on the practice version.

21. B — This is an Inference question, which asks what can be inferred about Maria Lopez’s spot in 
the class. The correct answer, choice B, is supported by the instruction that Maria must respond to the 
email to confirm her registration, indicating she will lose her spot if she does not reply.  
• Choice A is incorrect because the email does not state that Maria is currently on the waiting list, 
only that there is one.  
• Choice C is incorrect because paying the fee is required at check-in, not to secure her spot.  
• Choice D is incorrect because there is no indication that Maria has told Michael Brown she 
cannot attend. 
22. A — This is a Factual question, which asks what Maria Lopez must take to the class.  
The correct answer, choice A, is supported by the statement that there is a $10 fee payable at check-in. 
• Choice B is incorrect because ingredients are provided by the class (and covered by the  
$10 fee). 
• Choice C is incorrect because hair nets will be provided at the event.  
• Choice D is incorrect because aprons are available to borrow or she may bring her own,  
but bringing one is not required. 
23. C — This is an Inference question, which asks what is suggested about Emma’s semester.  
The correct answer, choice C, is supported by Emma’s statement that she finally traveled after 
wrapping up midterms, indicating she was too busy with coursework to travel until last weekend.  
• Choice A is incorrect because Emma is studying in Osaka, not Kyoto.  
• Choice B is incorrect because there is no mention of her visiting many cities before this trip.  
• Choice D is incorrect because she mentions completing her midterms, not neglecting them. 
24. C — This is an Inference question, which asks what can be inferred about the Kinkaku-ji. The 
correct answer, choice C, is supported by Emma’s description of the Golden Pavilion’s “gold-leaf-
covered exterior reflecting on the tranquil pond,” indicating it is located next to a small body of water.  
• Choice A is incorrect because Kinkaku-ji and Fushimi Inari Shrine are separate locations.  
• Choice B is incorrect because the gold-leaf exterior refers to the building’s surface, not leaves 
from trees. “Leaf” in “gold-leaf” refers to a piece of metal that is flat and thin.  
• Choice D is incorrect because there is no mention of Kinkaku-ji being on top of a hill. 
25. B — This is a Factual question, which asks which statement best characterizes Emma’s 
experience in Gion Kobu. The correct answer, choice B, is supported by Emma’s comment that the 
atmosphere “was magical, and it seemed as if I was stepping back in time,” showing she felt like she was 
visiting a different historical period.  
• Choice A is incorrect because there is no mention of street magicians.

• Choice C is incorrect because Emma does not mention being rushed or missing out on sights.  
• Choice D is incorrect because, while she notes the presence of traditional teahouses, Emma 
does not say she drank tea there. 
26. B — This is a Vocabulary question, which asks for the meaning of the word “feats” as used in 
the passage. The correct answer, choice B, is supported by the context describing aqueducts as 
“impressive engineering feats,” meaning remarkable achievements.  
• Choice A is incorrect because “examples” does not capture the sense of accomplishment.  
• Choice C is incorrect because “skills” refers to ability, not the result of using that ability.  
• Choice D is incorrect because “investments” refers to resources put into something, not the 
accomplishment itself. 
27. D — This is a Rhetorical Purpose question, which asks why the author mentions public baths, 
fountains, households, and agriculture. The correct answer, choice D, is supported by the sentence 
explaining that aqueducts supplied water for these uses, showing their usefulness to Roman cities.  
• Choice A is incorrect because the sentence does not discuss the effort required to 
 build aqueducts.  
• Choice B is incorrect because there is no suggestion that aqueducts could not provide  
enough water.  
• Choice C is incorrect because, while the aqueducts were important for “growth and 
sustainability,” the uses of the aqueducts are not mentioned to emphasize this point. Also, there 
is no mention of “rapid” growth in the text. 
28. B — This is a Factual question, which asks what specific ancient structure is mentioned as 
still existing today. The correct answer, choice B, is supported by the reference to the Pont du Gard, 
described as a “three-tiered bridge that remains standing today.”  
• Choice A is incorrect because, although tunnels are mentioned, none are identified as  
still existing.  
• Choice C is incorrect because, while ancient fountains are mentioned, none are identified as  
still existing.  
• Choice D is incorrect because channels are discussed in relation to Persian qanats but not as 
structures that survive today. 
29. D — This is a Factual question, which asks what problem with ancient aqueducts is mentioned  
in the passage. The correct answer, choice D, is supported by the statement that constructing  
and maintaining aqueducts “required significant resources and labor,” indicating the cost and  
effort involved.  
• Choice A is incorrect because, although Persian qanats used groundwater, there is no mention 
of environmental damage.

• Choice B is incorrect because the passage does not state that aqueducts provided a limited 
amount of water.  
• Choice C is incorrect because Persian qanats are described as “exceptionally durable,” not 
lacking durability. 
30. C — This is an Insert Text question, which asks where the sentence “This meant that the source 
of the water had to be higher than the city to which it was brought” best fits in the passage. The correct 
answer, choice C, is supported by the preceding sentence about the Romans using gravity to carry 
water over long distances; inserting the sentence here clarifies why elevation was necessary. “This,”  
the first word in the inserted sentence, refers to “using gravity.” 
• Choice A is incorrect because it would interrupt the definition of aqueducts.  
• Choice B is incorrect because it would come before the explanation of how water  
was transported.  
• Choice D is incorrect because it would separate the description of Roman aqueduct 
construction from its uses. 
31. D — This is a Negative Factual question, which asks what does NOT occur inside PV cells. The 
correct answer, choice D, is supported by the passage’s clarification that PV cells do not store electricity 
like a battery; instead, they convert sunlight into electricity in real time, and a separate storage system 
is needed.  
• Choice A is incorrect because the passage DOES state that sunlight is absorbed by a 
semiconductor material.  
• Choice B is incorrect because the passage DOES explain that energy from light knocks electrons 
loose from atoms.  
• Choice C is incorrect because the passage DOES describe how the flow of electric current is 
captured and used to power devices. 
32. B — This is a Factual question, which asks what the author indicates about moonlight solar panels. 
The correct answer, choice B, is supported by the statement that moonlight solar panels “can generate 
electricity at night, during rain, and under overcast skies,” showing they function in low-light conditions. 
• Choice A is incorrect because the passage does not compare their efficiency or cost-
effectiveness to traditional PV cells.  
• Choice C is incorrect because the passage does not mention energy storage as a feature of 
moonlight solar panels.  
• Choice D is incorrect because the passage states that they generate electricity in real time.

33. A — This is a Vocabulary question, which asks for the meaning of the word “viable” in the passage. 
The correct answer, choice A, is supported by the context describing moonlight solar panels as making 
renewable energy “a more viable option in diverse environments,” meaning more practical or feasible.  
• Choice B is incorrect because “predictable” does not fit the context.  
• Choice C is incorrect because “valuable” refers to worth, not practicality.  
• Choice D is incorrect because “adaptable” means able to change, which is not the  
intended meaning here. 
34. A — This is an Inference question, which asks for an advantage of floating wind farms compared  
to traditional wind farms. The correct answer, choice A, is supported by the passage’s explanation  
that floating wind farms can be deployed far from land, “where wind speeds are often stronger and 
more consistent than those on land,” allowing them to harness wind energy in larger amounts and  
more consistently.  
• Choice B is incorrect because the passage mentions maintenance and initial costs as 
challenges, not ease of installation or maintenance.  
• Choice C is incorrect because the cost-effectiveness of underwater cables is not discussed.  
• Choice D is incorrect because the passage does not mention longevity as an advantage. 
35. B — This is an Insert Text question, which asks where the sentence “How do they work?” best 
fits in the passage. The correct answer, choice B, is supported by the fact that the following sentences 
provide an answer to this question (explaining the process of how PV cells function). 
• Choice A is incorrect because it would precede the introduction of PV cells.  
• Choice C is incorrect because it would interrupt the explanation about energy conversion  
and storage.  
• Choice D is incorrect because it would come after the discussion of moonlight solar panels,  
not before the explanation of the functioning of PV cells.

11. A — This is a Rhetorical Purpose question, which asks why the author mentions Élisée Reclus and 
Frédéric Le Play. The correct answer, choice A, is supported by the passage’s statement that the term 
“social geography” was first used by these individuals at the end of the nineteenth century, identifying 
the origins of the field.  
• Choice B is incorrect because the passage does not discuss the evolution of social geography.  
• Choice C is incorrect because the reference to Reclus and Le Play is not used to contrast 
geography and social geography.  
• Choice D is incorrect because the passage does not focus on two schools of thought within the 
field of social geography.

12. C — This is a Factual question, which asks about the result of increased population densities. 
The correct answer, choice C, is supported by the passage’s explanation that dense populations “can 
foster anonymity, as the sheer number of people in urban environments often reduces the likelihood of 
repeated interactions with the same individuals.”  
• Choice A is incorrect because the passage does not mention sharp declines in living conditions. 
• Choice B is incorrect because stronger bonds are not discussed; instead, anonymity 
is emphasized.  
• Choice D is incorrect because the passage states that cities offer better access to resources, 
not a reduction. 
13. A — This is a Vocabulary question, which asks for the meaning of the word “disparities” in the 
passage. The correct answer, choice A, is supported by the context describing how some urban 
residents benefit more than others, indicating inequalities.  
• Choice B is incorrect because “difficulties” does not capture the sense of unequal outcomes.  
• Choice C is incorrect because “debates” refers to arguments, not differences.  
• Choice D is incorrect because “shortages” means lack of resources, not unequal distribution. 
14. B — This is a Negative Factual question, which asks what is NOT mentioned as a topic included 
in social geography. The correct answer, choice B, is supported by the fact that the passage does not 
discuss how population growth affects employment.  
• Choice A is incorrect because the passage DOES address how society changes because  
of urbanization.  
• Choice C is incorrect because equitable resource distribution IS discussed.  
• Choice D is incorrect because the passage DOES mention measures to enhance inclusivity 
among people from various backgrounds. 
15. A — This is an Insert Text question, which asks where the sentence “It alters how people interact 
with the landscape and with each other” best fits in the passage. The correct answer, choice A, is 
supported by the context at the beginning of the passage, where urbanization and social geography are 
introduced, making this location the most logical place for the sentence. “It” in the inserted sentence 
refers to “urbanization” in the first sentence of the passage. 
• Choice B is incorrect because it would interrupt the historical note about the term’s origins.  
• Choice C is incorrect because it would disrupt the discussion of population density and  
social relationships.  
• Choice D is incorrect because it would come after the discussion of resource access, not the 
initial definition.

On the next page is a table that converts your Listening practice section total into a TOEFL iBT® 
Listening scaled score. Take the total of raw points from your Answer Key/Self-Scoring Chart for 
both modules and find that number in the Raw Point Total column of the table. The Scale Score column 
of the table provides the equivalent TOEFL iBT® Listening score for each number of raw points. An 
equivalent CEFR (Common European Framework of Reference for Languages) Level is also shown. 
For example, if the Raw Point Total from your Answer Key is 23, the table shows a Scale Score of 4. 
Each Scale Score maps to an equivalent CEFR Level. The CEFR Level for a Raw Point Total of 23 is B2. 
You should use your score and CEFR level estimate as a general guide only. Your actual score on the 
TOEFL iBT® test may be higher or lower than your score on the practice version.

Listening Scripts and Answer Explanations 
Module 1 
Listen and Choose a Response 
1. Track 53 Listening Script: I’m not free this evening. 
Answer Explanation: C — “Well, I understand” is the best response because it acknowledges the 
speaker’s unavailability in a polite and empathetic way. It shows social awareness by accepting the 
situation without pressing for alternative plans or expressing disappointment, which helps maintain a 
positive conversational tone. 
• Choice A is incorrect because “What about this evening, then?” repeats the time that the 
speaker has already said they are unavailable, making it illogical and inappropriate. 
• Choice B is incorrect because “How about a movie?” suggests an activity for the same  
evening, ignoring the speaker’s stated unavailability and failing to respond appropriately  
to their schedule. 
• Choice D is incorrect because “Sounds like a plan” implies agreement or confirmation of  
an arrangement, but no plan has been made—only a statement of unavailability. This response 
is inappropriate. 
2. Track 54 Listening Script: Who will be our next club president? 
Answer Explanation: C — “Keith has all the right skills” is the best response because it directly 
addresses the question by proposing a candidate and providing a reason for the choice. This reply is 
both informative and relevant, as it offers a logical suggestion and supports it with a justification. 
• Choice A is incorrect because “Jenna disagrees” does not answer the question about who  
will be president. Instead, it introduces an unrelated opinion without addressing the selection of 
a club president. 
• Choice B is incorrect because “It’s a demanding project” comments on the nature of the role 
rather than identifying a candidate, failing to provide the requested information. 
• Choice D is incorrect because “Let’s find out why” suggests investigating a reason but does not 
answer the question about who will be president, making it inappropriate. 
3. Track 55 Listening Script: Where is the university bookstore? 
Answer Explanation: B — “Sorry—I’m new on campus” is the best response because it communicates 
that the respondent does not know the answer. This reply is socially appropriate, as it acknowledges the 
question and provides a reasonable explanation for not being able to help. 
• Choice A is incorrect because “Sure you do” dismisses the question and does not provide any 
information about the bookstore’s location, making it both illogical and inappropriate. 
3064020100305f06092a864886f70d010701301e060960864801650304012e3011040c84ee114e87059056de0e218702011080324a5569a7f5756f23a7b4b96fc08bd1e158952bce8c1c8cde660a4f59

CHAPTER 6: TOEFL iBT® PRACTICE TEST — ANSWERS, EXPLANATIONS, AND SCRIPTS
• Choice C is incorrect because “Yes, I love the library” refers to a different campus facility and 
does not answer the question about the bookstore’s location. 
• Choice D is incorrect because “This is such a large campus” is a general observation and does 
not provide any useful information or assistance regarding the bookstore’s location. 
4. Track 56 Listening Script: The seminar starts at ten a.m. 
Answer Explanation: C — “I still have time to grab breakfast” is the best response because it reacts 
to the information about the seminar’s start time by expressing how it affects the speaker’s plans. This 
reply is relevant, showing that the speaker has processed the information and is making a decision 
based on it. 
• Choice A is incorrect because “I recorded our interviews” is unrelated to the seminar’s timing 
and does not address the information provided. 
• Choice B is incorrect because “I missed your show last night” refers to a different event and fails 
to respond to the statement about the seminar. 
• Choice D is incorrect because “When did you begin your studies?” shifts the topic entirely and 
does not acknowledge or build on the information about the seminar’s start time. 
5. Track 57 Listening Script: Do you enjoy cooking? 
Answer Explanation: A — “I absolutely love it” is the best response because it gives a clear and 
enthusiastic answer to the question. This reply directly addresses the speaker’s inquiry and conveys 
positive emotion, making it both relevant and socially engaging. 
• Choice B is incorrect because “My favorite restaurant” does not address the question about 
cooking. It shifts the topic to dining out instead of personal enjoyment of cooking. 
• Choice C is incorrect because “The grocery store is closed” is unrelated to the question and 
does not indicate whether the speaker enjoys cooking. 
• Choice D is incorrect because “I watched a cooking show” mentions an activity related to 
cooking but does not answer whether the speaker enjoys cooking, making it an indirect and 
incomplete response. 
6. Track 58 Listening Script: Do you like the new layout of the library? 
Answer Explanation: D — “There are a lot of comfortable places to study” is the best response 
because it provides a positive opinion about the new layout by highlighting a specific benefit. This reply 
answers the question indirectly, focusing on an aspect of the layout that the speaker appreciates. 
• Choice A is incorrect because “We’re getting new ergonomic chairs next week” refers to a future 
change rather than expressing an opinion about the current layout. 
• Choice B is incorrect because “We had a session about the changes” mentions an event related 
to the layout but does not indicate whether the speaker likes or dislikes it. 
• Choice C is incorrect because “The new layout map was posted online” provides information 
about the map, not an opinion or feeling about the new layout itself. 
3064020100305f06092a864886f70d010701301e060960864801650304012e3011040c84ee114e87059056de0e218702011080324a5569a7f5756f23a7b4b96fc08bd1e158952bce8c1c8cde660a4f59

7. Track 59 Listening Script: Which floor is the admissions office on? 
Answer Explanation: D — “It’s one floor up” is the best response because it gives the precise location 
of the admissions office, directly satisfying the information requested. This reply is helpful and relevant, 
making it easy for the questioner to find the office. 
• Choice A is incorrect because “I got an early start” refers to the speaker’s schedule and does not 
address the location of the admissions office. 
• Choice B is incorrect because “Not to my knowledge” fails to provide any information about the 
office’s location and does not help the person asking. 
• Choice C is incorrect because “There’s a restroom on every floor” gives information about 
restrooms, not the admissions office, making it irrelevant to the question. 
8. Track 60 Listening Script: That was an inspiring opening ceremony at the art museum. 
Answer Explanation: A — “I couldn’t make it” is the best response because it explains the speaker’s 
absence from the event in an appropriate way. This reply acknowledges the original statement and 
provides a relevant reason for not sharing the experience. 
• Choice B is incorrect because “Let’s go together” suggests attending an event in the future, but 
the opening ceremony has already occurred, making this response illogical. 
• Choice C is incorrect because “I’ll wait for you there” implies a plan to meet at the museum, 
which does not fit the past-tense statement about the ceremony. 
• Choice D is incorrect because “Are you going to attend?” asks about future attendance, while 
the original statement refers to an event that has already happened. 
9. Track 61 Listening Script: Where is your favorite place to relax? 
Answer Explanation: D — “My dorm room” is the best response because it specifies a location, directly 
answering the question about where the speaker prefers to relax. This reply is clear, relevant, and fits 
naturally in a conversation about personal preferences. 
• Choice A is incorrect because “With friends” describes company rather than a place, failing to 
answer the question about location. 
• Choice B is incorrect because “Yoga” refers to an activity, not a physical place to relax. 
• Choice C is incorrect because “It’s stressful” contradicts the idea of relaxation and does not 
provide a location, making it illogical and irrelevant. 
10. Track 62 Listening Script: Why did you cancel your appointment at the student health  
center today? 
Answer Explanation: D — “I decided to reschedule for next week” is the best response because it 
directly explains the reason for canceling the appointment. This reply is both relevant and informative, 
as it addresses the question by providing a logical and appropriate follow-up action. It shows that the 
cancellation was not arbitrary but part of a plan to go at a later time.
3064020100305f06092a864886f70d010701301e060960864801650304012e3011040c84ee114e87059056de0e218702011080324a5569a7f5756f23a7b4b96fc08bd1e158952bce8c1c8cde660a4f59

312    THE OFFICIAL GUIDE TO THE TOEFL iBT® TEST: POCKET EDITION     ETS.ORG/TOEFL
• Choice A is incorrect because “I’ll cancel the subscription” refers to a different type of 
cancellation (a subscription) and does not address the appointment at the student  
health center. 
• Choice B is incorrect because “Oh, I’m sorry to hear that” expresses sympathy rather than 
providing a reason for the cancellation, failing to answer the question. 
• Choice C is incorrect because “She’s a court-appointed lawyer” is unrelated to the topic of 
health center appointments. 
11. Track 63 Listening Script: That was a wonderful performance. 
Answer Explanation: B — “I’m a big fan of the opera” is the best response because it acknowledges 
the compliment about the performance and expresses enthusiasm for the type of event being 
discussed. This reply is appropriate, shows engagement with the topic, and helps continue the 
conversation in a positive way. 
• Choice A is incorrect because “Does tomorrow work?” shifts the topic to scheduling and does 
not respond to the comment about the performance. 
• Choice C is incorrect because “In a minute” is vague and does not relate to the performance or 
the context of the conversation. 
• Choice D is incorrect because “I’m on vacation” is unrelated to the performance and does not 
acknowledge or build on the original statement. 
12. Track 64 Listening Script: Who borrowed my physics book? 
Answer Explanation: A — “John did” is the best response because it directly and succinctly identifies 
the person who borrowed the physics book, providing the specific information requested. 
• Choice B is incorrect because “No, they’re on the way” refers to something arriving, which does 
not answer who borrowed the book. 
• Choice C is incorrect because “Next week, I think” gives a time frame rather than a person, 
failing to address the question. 
• Choice D is incorrect because “I need reading glasses” is unrelated to the topic of borrowing a 
book and does not provide any useful information. 
Listen to a Conversation 
13–14. Track 65 Listening Script: 
Narrator: Listen to a conversation. 
Woman: Hey, James. Have you been to the new café in the student center? I haven’t been there yet. 
Man: Yeah, I went there yesterday after class. They have a great selection of drinks and snacks. 
Woman: That’s good to know. Are the prices reasonable? 
Man: Surprisingly, yes. It’s actually cheaper than the other places around campus.

Woman: Nice! I’ve been looking for a new spot to study. I’ll check it out this weekend. 
Man: I think you’ll like it. It’s quiet, and they have plenty of seating. 
Answer Explanations: 
13. C — This is a Factual question, which asks what the man said about the new café. The correct 
answer, choice C, is supported by the man’s statement: “Surprisingly, yes. It’s actually cheaper than the 
other places around campus.” This directly confirms that the food and drinks are affordable. 
• Choice A is incorrect because the man does not mention anything about the staff. 
• Choice B is incorrect because there is no mention of vegetarian options on the menu. 
• Choice D is incorrect because the man does not mention that the café is easy to find. 
14. A — This is an Inference question, which asks what the woman means when she says, “I’ll check 
it out.” The correct answer, choice A, is supported by the context of the conversation. The woman 
expresses interest in the café after hearing it’s quiet and affordable and says she’s been looking for a 
new spot to study. Her statement implies she plans to visit the café. 
• Choice B is incorrect. While “check it out” can refer to borrowing a book in some contexts, in this 
context, it refers to investigating or visiting the café. 
• Choice C is incorrect because there is no mention of writing a check or making a payment. 
• Choice D is incorrect. Although “check out” can refer to paying for a purchase in some contexts, 
in this context, it refers to going to the café. 
15–16. Track 66 Listening Script: 
Narrator: Listen to a conversation. 
Woman: Hey, have you finished your part of the group project for our marketing class? It’s due 
tomorrow afternoon. 
Man: I’m almost finished with the competitor analysis for the smartphone market. There are so many 
competitors, so I decided to focus on the four most prominent ones. 
Woman: Oh, that makes sense. I just finished formatting the slides we’re going to use for the 
presentation. I think you’ll like the borders and color scheme. Do you want me to send you the file  
we’re using? 
Man: Yes, please! That would save me a lot of time. I’ll drop my section in once I’m done. 
Woman: No problem. I’ll email it to you now. 
Answer Explanations: 
15. B — This is a Factual question, which asks why the man is focusing on four companies. The correct 
answer, choice B, is supported by the man’s statement: “There are so many competitors, so I decided 
3064020100305f06092a864886f70d010701301e060960864801650304012e3011040c84ee114e87059056de0e218702011080324a5569a7f5756f23a7b4b96fc08bd1e158952bce8c1c8cde660a4f59

to focus on the four most prominent ones.” This shows that he chose to concentrate on the most 
significant competitors in the smartphone market. 
• Choice A is incorrect because the man says he decided to focus on four companies, not that he 
was assigned to do so. 
• Choice C is incorrect because he does not mention any difficulty finding information about 
smaller companies. 
• Choice D is incorrect because he does not say that time constraints influenced his decision. 
16. D — This is a Factual question, which asks what the woman will probably do next. The correct 
answer, choice D, is supported by the woman’s statement: “No problem. I’ll email it to you now.” This 
clearly indicates that she plans to send the man the presentation file. 
• Choice A is incorrect because she does not offer to help write his section—only to send the file. 
• Choice B is incorrect because there is no mention of printing the final version. 
• Choice C is incorrect because she does not suggest asking the professor for more time. 
17–18. Track 67 Listening Script: 
Narrator: Listen to a conversation. 
Woman: Did you book your flight to the conference at Northbridge University? 
Man: Just last night. I’m flying out Saturday morning. 
Woman: I haven’t booked yet. I’m thinking about the train for this trip—it stops close to the campus. 
Man: True, but the plane’s faster, and there’s a shuttle from the airport every hour. 
Woman: Good to know. Where’s the check-in area? 
Man: At the student center, across from the library. I downloaded the campus map. 
Woman: I should do that too. I’ve heard the campus is pretty spread out. That’ll help. 
Man: Definitely. 
Woman: I’ll try to book a flight tonight. Thanks for the tips! 
Answer Explanations: 
17. B — This is a Main Idea question, which asks what the speakers are discussing. The correct answer, 
choice B, is supported by the woman’s opening question: “Did you book your flight to the conference 
at Northbridge University?” and the man’s response about flying out Saturday morning. The rest of the 
conversation continues with details about transportation options, the campus layout, and check-in 
procedures—all centered around their travel plans for the conference.

• Choice D is incorrect because there is no mention of a group report or academic project. 
18. C — This is an Inference question, which asks what can be inferred about the woman. The 
correct answer, choice C, is supported by her question: “Where’s the check-in area?” and her comment 
“I’ve heard the campus is pretty spread out” in addition to her comment that she should download 
a campus map. These statements suggest she has not yet visited the campus, indicating that she is 
unfamiliar with the destination. 
• Choice A is incorrect because there is no indication that she has never traveled by plane before. 
• Choice B is incorrect because she does not mention cost as a reason for considering the train. 
• Choice D is incorrect because there is no mention of a presentation or any work she is  
still completing. 
Listen to an Announcement 
19–20. Track 68 Listening Script: 
Narrator: Listen to an announcement in a classroom. 
Man: Attention, everyone. Starting next week, our Art and Design class will be moving to a new and 
improved space! We’ll now be meeting in room 304, instead of the library annex downstairs, which 
we’ve been using temporarily. Thank you all for your patience while the new audiovisual equipment was 
being installed—the upgraded room is ready, and we’re excited for you to experience it! Please make a 
note of the room change and continue to arrive on time. 
Answer Explanations: 
19. A — This is a Factual question, which asks what best describes room 304 according to the 
announcement. The correct answer, choice A, is supported by the speaker’s statement, “Thank you 
all for your patience while the new audiovisual equipment was being installed—the upgraded room is 
ready...” This confirms that room 304 has received a technical enhancement. 
• Choice B is incorrect because the speaker says the class had been meeting in the library annex 
temporarily, not room 304. 
• Choice C is incorrect because the location of room 304 relative to the library annex  
is not mentioned. 
• Choice D is incorrect because there is no mention of the room being converted into a  
science lab. 
20. D — This is a Factual question about what the speaker asks students to do. The correct answer, 
choice D, is supported by the speaker’s final instruction: “Please make a note of the room change and 
continue to arrive on time.” This is a clear request for students to remain punctual. 
• Choice A is incorrect because the speaker does not mention reviewing notes. 
3064020100305f06092a864886f70d010701301e060960864801650304012e3011040c84ee114e87059056de0e218702011080324a5569a7f5756f23a7b4b96fc08bd1e158952bce8c1c8cde660a4f59

• Choice B is incorrect because the speaker says the class is moving away from the library annex, 
not going to the library. 
• Choice C is incorrect because students are not asked to check their equipment. The speaker 
only mentions that new audiovisual equipment has been installed. 
21–22. Track 69 Listening Script: 
Narrator: Listen to an announcement in a classroom. 
Woman: Before we get started today, I just wanted to let you all know that I’m making an adjustment to 
our class schedule. Because so many of you have a class in the Williams Building just before this class, 
from now on we’ll be starting class ten minutes later. That should give you plenty of time to get over 
here without having to rush. Keep in mind that now you won’t have any excuse if you can’t make it to 
class on time. 
Answer Explanations: 
21. C — This is an Inference question, which asks what the speaker implies about the Williams 
Building. The correct answer, choice C, is supported by the speaker’s explanation that many students 
have a class in the Williams Building just before this one, and that the start time is being moved ten 
minutes later to give them time to get to the current classroom “without having to rush.” This suggests 
that the Williams Building is located far away from where the class meets. 
• Choice A is incorrect because there is no mention of renovations or the building closing. 
• Choice B is incorrect because the speaker does not comment on the size of the building. 
• Choice D is incorrect because there is no reference to the building’s original purpose or its use 
as a dormitory. 
22. D — This is an Inference question, which asks what problem the speaker is most likely addressing 
by making a change. The correct answer, choice D, is supported by the speaker’s explanation that the 
class will start ten minutes later because many students have a class in the Williams Building just 
before this one. The speaker then says, “That should give you plenty of time to get over here without 
having to rush,” and adds, “now you won’t have any excuse if you can’t make it to class on time.”  
These remarks imply that students have been arriving late, and the schedule change is intended to 
solve that problem. 
• Choice A is incorrect because the speaker does not mention students eating during class. 
• Choice B is incorrect because parking issues are not discussed. 
• Choice C is incorrect because there is no mention of students failing to complete assignments. 
23–24. Track 70 Listening Script:

evaluation form through the portal, please use the password sent to you from an automated email. 
Answer Explanations: 
23. C — This is a Factual question, which asks how students may submit the course evaluation 
form. The correct answer, choice C, is supported by the speaker’s statement, “You can submit it online 
through the university portal.” This is a direct instruction about the submission method. 
• Choice A is incorrect because the speaker says to submit the form to the university 
administrator, not the professor. 
• Choice B is incorrect because there is no mention of the Economics Department as a 
submission location. 
• Choice D is incorrect because the speaker refers to submitting the form online, not by  
sending an email. 
24. C — This is an Inference question, which asks about the likely significance of this week. The 
correct answer, choice C, is supported by the speaker’s mention that final grades will be announced 
on Friday and that course evaluations are due by Thursday. These details suggest that the semester is 
coming to an end. 
• Choice A is incorrect because orientation for new students is not mentioned and would typically 
occur at the beginning of a semester. 
• Choice B is incorrect because the speaker refers to final grades being announced, not to 
students preparing for final exams. 
• Choice D is incorrect because there is no mention of students choosing their major areas  
of study. 
Listen to an Academic Talk 
25–28. Track 71 Listening Script: 
Narrator: Listen to part of a science podcast. 
Man: Renewable energy comes from natural processes that are replenished constantly, such as 
sunlight, wind, and water. They’re an alternative to fossil fuels, which contribute to greenhouse gases 
and global warming. 
One of the most widely used forms of renewable energy is solar power. You might have seen solar 
panels on rooftops of private homes or small buildings that convert sunlight into electricity. These 
panels can last for decades. Obviously, they wouldn’t work in places that are cloudy or rainy most of 
the year. Even in places with plenty of sunlight, no energy is produced at night. This means that you’ll 
need to store energy for later use, but this requires batteries to be connected to solar panels, and these 
batteries can be expensive.

Wind is another common renewable energy source. Wind turbines are large structures with blades that 
spin when the wind blows. They’re typically installed in open areas like farmland and coastal regions. 
Why are they rare in residential areas? Well, when the blades of wind turbines slice through the air, they 
produce a swishing or whooshing sound. The faster the blades, the louder it gets. Imagine living near a 
wind turbine! 
Unlike solar panels, wind turbines require lots of maintenance. Oil changes, blade inspections, 
mechanical repairs… a lot needs to be done on a regular basis. Don’t forget that some wind farms are 
located offshore, in the open sea. Think about the extra expenses needed to reach these farms and the 
harsh conditions that need to be overcome. 
Answer Explanations: 
25. B — This is a Main Idea question, which asks what the talk is mainly about. The correct answer, 
choice B, is supported by the speaker’s discussion of two widely used forms of renewable energy: solar 
power and wind. The speaker compares their advantages and limitations, such as solar panels needing 
sunlight and batteries and wind turbines requiring maintenance and producing noise. 
• Choice A is incorrect because fossil fuels are mentioned only briefly as a contrast to  
renewable energy. 
• Choice C is incorrect because the talk discusses more than just solar power—it also covers 
wind energy. 
• Choice D is incorrect because the speaker does not focus on environmental impacts of 
renewable energy sources. 
26. D — This is a Factual question, which asks what the speaker says about batteries when discussing 
solar power. The correct answer, choice D, is supported by the speaker’s statement, “this requires 
batteries to be connected to solar panels, and these batteries can be expensive.” The correct answer is 
a paraphrase of this statement. 
• Choice A is incorrect because the speaker says batteries are needed to store energy for  
later use. 
• Choice B is incorrect because the speaker does not describe batteries as an innovation. 
• Choice C is incorrect because there is no mention of weather-related damage to batteries. 
27. A — This is a Purpose question, which asks why the speaker describes the noises that a wind  
turbine makes. The correct answer, choice A, is supported by the speaker’s question, “Why are they  
rare in residential areas?” followed by a description of the swishing or whooshing sounds produced  
by wind turbines. This explanation helps listeners understand why turbines are not commonly placed 
near homes. 
• Choice B is incorrect because the speaker does not compare types of wind turbines. 
• Choice C is incorrect because the speaker does not link the noise to maintenance needs.

from residents. 
28. B — This is an Inference question, which asks what the speaker implies about wind farms located 
offshore. The correct answer, choice B, is supported by the speaker’s comment, “Think about the extra 
expenses needed to reach these farms and the harsh conditions that need to be overcome.” This 
implies that offshore wind farms involve additional maintenance costs. 
• Choice A is incorrect because the speaker does not mention whether offshore wind farms are 
becoming more common. 
• Choice C is incorrect because productivity is not discussed. 
• Choice D is incorrect because the speaker describes offshore wind farms as more challenging 
to maintain, not easier to operate. 
29–32. Track 72 Listening Script: 
Narrator: Listen to a talk on a podcast about art. 
Woman: Today, we’re going to explore the fascinating world of street art and its impact on urban 
environments. Street art, which includes graffiti and mural painting, has evolved from being seen 
as mere vandalism to being recognized as a legitimate form of artistic expression. Artists use public 
spaces to showcase their work, often reflecting social and political themes. 
One of the key benefits of street art is its ability to transform drab and neglected areas into vibrant 
and visually stimulating environments. Murals can brighten up a dull wall, adding color and life to a 
community. This transformation can foster a sense of pride among residents, encouraging them to take 
ownership of their surroundings. 
Street art can also serve as a powerful tool for social change. It provides artists with a platform to 
address important issues such as inequality, environmental concerns, and cultural identity. For 
example, artists may create pieces that highlight the struggles of marginalized communities. 
However, street art is not without its challenges. The legality of street art is often debated, as many 
artists work without official permission. This can lead to conflicts with property owners and law 
enforcement. Additionally, the transient nature of street art means that it can be painted over or 
removed at any time, making it a potentially impermanent form of expression. 
Despite these challenges, street art remains an influential aspect of contemporary urban culture. 
It allows artists to reach a wider audience and engage with the public in meaningful ways while 
transforming urban spaces.  
Answer Explanations: 
29. B — This is a Main Idea question, which asks about the main topic of the talk. The correct answer, 
choice B, is supported by the speaker’s overview of street art, including its evolution from vandalism

to recognized art, its impact on urban spaces, and its role in social commentary. The talk compares 
different aspects of street art and emphasizes its influence on cities. 
• Choice A is incorrect because the speaker does not focus specifically on the history of graffiti. 
• Choice C is incorrect because mural painting is mentioned as one form of street art but the talk 
does not explore different styles. 
• Choice D is incorrect because legal issues are discussed briefly but they are not the central 
focus of the talk. 
30. B — This is a Purpose question, which asks why the speaker mentions marginalized communities. 
The correct answer, choice B, is supported by the speaker’s statement that street art “provides artists 
with a platform to address important issues such as inequality, environmental concerns, and cultural 
identity,” and gives the example of artists creating pieces that highlight the struggles of marginalized 
communities. 
• Choice A is incorrect because financial challenges of street artists are not discussed. 
• Choice C is incorrect because the legality of murals is discussed separately and not in 
connection with marginalized groups. 
• Choice D is incorrect because the speaker does not describe the aesthetic qualities of street art 
when mentioning marginalized communities. 
31. C — This is a Factual question, which asks about a challenge related to street art mentioned by the 
speaker. The correct answer, choice C, is supported by the speaker’s comment that “many artists work 
without official permission,” which “can lead to conflicts with property owners and law enforcement.” 
This highlights the difficulty of gaining approval to create street art. 
• Choice A is incorrect because the speaker does not mention difficulty finding artists. 
• Choice B is incorrect because funding is not discussed as a challenge. 
• Choice D is incorrect because promoting unity and hope is not presented as a challenge. It is 
mentioned as a potential benefit of street art. 
32. D — This is an Attitude question, which asks about the speaker’s attitude toward street art. The 
correct answer, choice D, is supported by the speaker’s positive tone when describing how street art 
can beautify areas, foster pride, and promote social change. The speaker also acknowledges challenges 
such as legality and impermanence, showing a balanced but overall favorable view. 
• Choice A is incorrect because the speaker clearly treats street art as a legitimate form of artistic 
expression, stating that it has “evolved from being seen as mere vandalism to being recognized 
as a legitimate form of artistic expression.” 
• Choice B is incorrect because the speaker does not express a mostly negative attitude. The 
challenges are acknowledged but not emphasized as dominant concerns. 
• Choice C is incorrect because the speaker never encourages students to create street art.  
This type of hope is not reflected in the talk.

Module 2 
Listen and Choose a Response 
1. Track 73 Listening Script: When does the college bookstore open? 
Answer Explanation: B — “The hours are on the door” is the best response because it provides a 
logical and helpful way to find out when the bookstore opens. It acknowledges the question and offers a 
practical solution. 
• Choice A is incorrect because “It’s near the library” gives information about the location instead 
of the opening hours, so it does not answer the question. 
• Choice C is incorrect because “They get a lot of customers” is a general comment about 
popularity, not about the store’s hours. 
• Choice D is incorrect because “I went there with my friend” refers to a past visit but does not 
provide any information about when the store opens. 
2. Track 74 Listening Script: Could you help me set up this printer? 
Answer Explanation: A — “I need to prioritize other work” is the best response because it politely 
declines the request for help by giving a valid reason. It is socially appropriate and directly addresses 
the question. 
• Choice B is incorrect because “Let’s leave the package at the door” is unrelated to the printer 
setup and does not respond to the request. 
• Choice C is incorrect because “I’m not sure that’s the case” is vague and does not make sense in 
the context of being asked for help. 
• Choice D is incorrect because “I forgot to save my work” is a comment about another task. The 
comment does not acknowledge or respond to the request for assistance. 
3. Track 75 Listening Script: I heard you went to the bioscience conference. 
Answer Explanation: D — “It was quite informative” is the best response because it confirms 
attendance and provides a relevant opinion about the experience. It directly addresses the statement 
and adds meaningful detail. 
• Choice A is incorrect because “Could I listen to it?” does not make sense. Conferences are 
typically attended in person, and the question implies it already happened. 
• Choice B is incorrect because “Will it be next Tuesday?” contradicts the past-tense phrasing of 
the original statement. 
• Choice C is incorrect because “Yes, let’s go together” suggests future attendance, which does 
not fit the context of a past event. 
4. Track 76 Listening Script: Why is the athletic center closed? 
Answer Explanation: A — “It’s under renovation” is the best response because it gives a clear and 
logical reason for the closure. It directly answers the question with relevant information. 
3064020100305f06092a864886f70d010701301e060960864801650304012e3011040c84ee114e87059056de0e218702011080324a5569a7f5756f23a7b4b96fc08bd1e158952bce8c1c8cde660a4f59

• Choice B is incorrect because “On Mondays” gives a detail about a schedule but does not 
explain the current closure. 
• Choice C is incorrect because “Last week, I think” is vague and does not explain why the center 
is closed now. 
• Choice D is incorrect because “I don’t know its location” avoids the question and provides 
unrelated information. 
5. Track 77 Listening Script: Did you manage to get any guidance on your paper from the  
writing center? 
Answer Explanation: A — “I received some useful feedback from a tutor” is the best response 
because it directly answers the question about whether the speaker got guidance from the  
writing center. It confirms that help was received and specifies the source, making it both relevant  
and informative. 
• Choice B is incorrect because “I’ll check the schedule and see” refers to a future action, while 
the question asks about something that has already happened. It does not answer whether any 
guidance was received. 
• Choice C is incorrect because “I’ll probably ask my roommate for some help” suggests seeking 
help elsewhere and in the future, which does not respond to the question about past guidance 
from the writing center. 
• Choice D is incorrect because “Could you put some more paper in the printer for me?” is 
completely unrelated to the topic of getting help with a paper and does not address the 
question at all. 
Listen to a Conversation 
6–7. Track 78 Listening Script: 
Narrator: Listen to a conversation. 
Man: Hi, I saw you sent me a message earlier. I haven’t had a chance to read it yet—what’s happening? 
Woman: I wanted to let you know I had to move our study-group session. The library room we booked 
isn’t available anymore. 
Man: Oh no. Did you find another place? 
Woman: Yes, I reserved room 204 in the student center. It’s a bit farther, but it has a whiteboard and 
enough space. 
Man: Got it. I’ll post the update in our group chat. 
Woman: Thanks! That’ll help avoid any confusion.

Answer Explanations: 
6. B — This is a Factual question, which asks why the woman changed the meeting location. The 
correct answer, choice B, is supported by the woman’s statement that “the library room we booked isn’t 
available anymore,” indicating the reservation was canceled. 
• Choice A is incorrect because the woman does not mention the original room being too small. 
• Choice C is incorrect because the student center is described as “a bit farther,” not closer. 
• Choice D is incorrect because the woman mentions a whiteboard, not a projector. 
7. C — This is a Purpose question, which asks why the man says “I’ll post the update in our group chat.” 
The correct answer, choice C, is supported by the context of the conversation. The woman informs the 
man that the study group meeting location has changed, the man responds by saying he will post the 
update, and the woman says that will help avoid confusion. Although the man does not explicitly say he 
will notify the other members, his statement implies that he intends to share the new location with the 
group. This question requires the listener to infer the man’s intent based on what was said. 
• Choice A is incorrect because the man does not suggest that the group chat is confusing. 
• Choice B is incorrect because the woman has already confirmed the new location. The man 
does not need to double-check. 
• Choice D is incorrect because the man does not invite the woman to join the group chat. He 
only says that he will post some information in the chat.

Narrator: Listen to a conversation. 
Woman: Did you go to the jazz concert last night in the concert hall? 
Man: Yes. The quartet was incredible—especially the saxophonist. His solo near the end  
was really moving. 
Woman: I thought so too. I’m surprised more people didn’t show up. 
Man: Same here. I expected the hall to be packed, but it was barely half full. 
Woman: It’s too bad. They played beautifully. On top of that, the ticket prices were so reasonable. 
Man: Definitely. 
Woman: I’m going to write a short review for the school website—maybe it’ll get more people to come 
next time. 
Man: Great idea.

Listen to an Academic Talk 
12–15. Track 81 Listening Script: 
Narrator: Listen to a talk in an anthropology class. 
Woman: Cultural diffusion is the transmission of cultural beliefs, practices, and social norms from 
one group to another. Historically, this phenomenon has unfolded through different channels, such as 
commercial exchange, migratory movements, and, more recently, digital communication. 
A notable example is the spread of agricultural techniques. Innovations such as irrigation systems 
from ancient Persia or terrace farming from the Andes gradually spread to neighboring regions. This 
influenced food production and land use across continents. Similarly, linguistic diffusion has left 
indelible marks on global communication. The spread of Latin during the Roman Empire laid the 
foundation for Romance languages. Arabic was carried by traveling traders and scholars to enrich 
scientific and philosophical vocabularies from Spain to Southeast Asia. 
Another dimension of cultural diffusion is technological exchange. For example, the wheel was first 
developed in Mesopotamia, but it revolutionized transportation as it spread across Eurasia. And 
papermaking, which originated in China, transformed literacy and recordkeeping after reaching the 
Islamic world and later Europe. 
Religious diffusion has also shaped civilizations. Christianity, Islam, and Buddhism have all expanded 
far beyond their birthplaces through missionary work and trade networks like the Silk Road, though in 
many cases, religious traditions changed and grew to incorporate local customs. 
However, cultural diffusion is not always harmonious. The introduction of foreign customs can lead 
to resistance, especially if it’s perceived as a threat to identity or tradition. But despite these kinds of 
frictions, cultural diffusion is a driving force behind the richness and complexity of human societies. 
Answer Explanations: 
12. A — This is a Main Idea question, which asks about the central topic of the talk. The correct 
answer, choice A, is supported by the speaker’s discussion of how cultural beliefs, practices, and 
technologies spread across societies. 
• Choice B is incorrect because farming techniques are discussed as examples,  
not the main topic. 
• Choice C is incorrect because the talk focuses on diffusion, not the impact of ancient cultures. 
• Choice D is incorrect because ancient technologies are mentioned but not as the central theme.

Answer Explanations for Build a Sentence 
1. What a coincidence—(begin bold and underline) I’m doing the same for (end bold and underline) my roommate. 
Explanation: The sentence “What a coincidence—I’m doing the same for my roommate.” 
demonstrates correct sentence-level grammar and contextual appropriateness. Grammatically, the 
sentence is structured as a statement expressing surprise or delight at a shared activity. It begins 
with the exclamatory phrase “What a coincidence—,” which sets up the context for the similarity. The 
main clause “I’m doing the same for my roommate” uses the present continuous tense (“I’m doing”) 
to indicate a planned future action, and the phrase “the same for my roommate” clearly specifies that 
the speaker is planning a similar surprise party for their own roommate. Note that the answer choices 
include an extra, unused word, “as.” 
The word order is logical and adheres to standard English usage: 
• “I’m doing” (subject + present continuous verb) 
• “the same” (object indicating similarity) 
• “for my roommate” (prepositional phrase specifying the recipient of the action) 
Contextually, the sentence is a natural and relevant response to the initial statement about planning 
a surprise party for a roommate. It expresses a shared experience and highlights the coincidence 
between the speaker and the other person. The sentence is clear, concise, and appropriately framed for 
the situation, making it both grammatically correct and contextually suitable. 
2. I’m actually learning on my own (begin bold and underline) with an app that uses AI to simulate (end bold and underline) conversations. 
Explanation: The sentence “I’m actually learning on my own with an app that uses AI to simulate 
conversations.” demonstrates proper sentence-level grammar and contextual appropriateness. 
Grammatically, the sentence is structured as a statement describing how the speaker is learning 
Polish. It begins with the main clause “I’m actually learning on my own,” which establishes the context 
of independent study and describes a current, habitual activity. The phrase “with an app” specifies the 
tool being used, and the relative clause “that uses AI to simulate conversations” provides additional 
detail about the app’s capabilities. Note that the answer choices include an extra, unused word, “how.” 
The word order follows standard English sentence structure: 
• “I’m actually learning on my own” (subject + present continuous verb + adverbial phrase) 
• “with an app” (prepositional phrase indicating the means) 
• “that uses AI to simulate conversations” (relative clause modifying “app”) 
Contextually, the sentence is a natural and relevant response to the question “How are your  
Polish lessons going?” It explains the speaker’s approach to language learning, highlighting the use  
of technology (AI) and the specific method (simulating conversations). The sentence is clear, 
informative, and appropriately framed for the situation, making it both grammatically correct and 
contextually suitable.

To: Ms. Clark  
Subject: Appreciation for digital marketing workshop  
 
Dear Ms. Clark, 
Thank you for organising the digital marketing workshop. I really liked the part where you showed 
how ads work on the internet and how companies use them. The group activity was fun, but I didnt 
understand all the steps for making a ad. Still, it was interesting to see how people react to different 
pictures and words. 
This workshop helps my studies because now I know more about how businesses get customers 
online. It also gave me ideas for my school project, and I feel more confident talking about marketing  
in class. Sometimes I get confused with the terms, but your examples made it easier. 
I think it would be good if you can do more workshops like this, maybe every month. Many students 
would like to learn more and practice. If you need help with planning or want feedback, I am happy  
to help. 
Sincerly,  
Zeynep 
Comments: This response earns a score of 5 because it fully addresses all 3 required points in the 
prompt with clear and relevant elaboration. The writer thanks the organizer and specifies what was 
most valuable (“the part where you showed how ads work on the Internet and how companies use 
them”), explains how the workshop benefits their studies (“now I know more about how businesses get 
customers online… gave me ideas for my school project”), and suggests holding similar workshops more 
frequently (“maybe every month”). The tone is polite and appropriate for the context, and the email is 
logically organized with a clear opening, explanation, and closing. While there are minor language errors 
such as “organising,” “didnt,” “a ad,” and “Sincerly,” these do not interfere with clarity or effectiveness. 
The message demonstrates adequate syntactic variety, idiomatic phrasing, and appropriate social 
conventions, meeting the criteria for a fully successful response despite imperfections.

Write for an Academic Discussion 
I think studying history is very important for understanding today’s problems. When we learn about 
revolutions and social movements, we see how people fight for change and what mistakes was made 
before. This helps us not repeat same errors in politics or society. Andrew is right that history shows 
patterns in human behavior. 
But I also agree with Claire that we need to focus on present issues, like technology and health. 
Sometimes people spend too much time looking at past and forget to solve problems now. In my 
opinion, we should use history as a guide, but not let it stop us from acting in the present.  
Comments: This response earns a score of 5 because it is a clearly expressed and relevant 
contribution to the discussion. The writer states a clear opinion in favor of studying history and 
supports it with multiple reasons, including the value of learning from past mistakes and the 
importance of addressing present challenges. The ideas are well connected and coherent, with logical 
progression from acknowledging Andrew’s point to considering Claire’s perspective. The response 
demonstrates consistent facility in language use, showing a variety of sentence structures and 
appropriate vocabulary for the task. While there are minor grammatical and lexical errors (e.g., “what 
mistakes was made,” “not repeat same errors”), these do not interfere with meaning and are typical of 
competent writers under timed conditions. Overall, the response fulfills the communicative purpose 
effectively and displays strong control of language, meeting the criteria for a fully successful response.

Sample Student Response Listening Script: I think I’m a creative person because I try to find 
different ways to solve problems. For example, when I was helping plan a small community event, 
I suggested an activity where people could share ideas together. We had to paint… the idea was to 
decorate a wall in a parking lot. I asked everyone to paint a small part of the wall so the whole thing felt 
like a group effort. Doing that showed me that creativity isn’t only about art. It’s also about finding new 
ways to do something and helping people feel more involved.

Comments: The response fully answers both parts of the question with clear, relevant details. The 
speaker explains what creativity means in this context and provides a specific example involving the 
planning of a community event and decorating a wall as a group activity. Ideas progress logically from 
the speaker’s personal view to the example and then to a brief conclusion. A small disfluency and 
self-correction (“We had to paint… the idea was to…”) appear, but these do not interfere with clarity or 
listener comprehension. Vocabulary is simple and appropriate for the level, and grammatical control is 
generally strong, with minor imperfections. Overall, the response is clear, connected, and easy to follow. 
9. Video 2 Transcript: Great. Some people think that learning about art is just as important as learning 
science or math. Do you agree or disagree? Why? 
Play Track 92 to hear a sample student response. 
   
Sample Student Response Listening Script: Um… yeah, I think I agree with that, mostly. Art gives 
people a way to express themselves and, uh, see things from different angles. Science and math are 
important, of course, but they don’t really teach you how to deal with emotions or understand how 
other people are feeling. When I paint—uh, when I paint, it makes me slow down and calm down. I 
actually think more about what I’m feeling. So yeah, if students only study facts and numbers, they 
maybe miss that creative side, and I think that part is important too. 
Comments: The response fully addresses the question by clearly stating agreement and providing 
reasons supported with a personal example (painting and its emotional benefits). Ideas progress 
logically from general benefits of art to a specific experience and, though not necessary for a full score, 
concludes with a statement about balance in education. The pacing is natural and conversational. The 
speaker has brief pauses to collect thoughts, such as “Um” and “uh,” and a brief self-correction (“When 
I paint—uh, when I paint”), which do not hinder meaning or cause undue listener effort. The speaker’s 
pronunciation and pacing are natural and support clear communication. The grammar and vocabulary 
are used effectively to express ideas with precision and depth. 
10. Video 3 Transcript: Interesting. Some people believe that engaging in creative activities can 
improve mental well-being. Do you agree or disagree? Why? 
Play Track 93 to hear a sample student response. 
 
Sample Student Response Listening Script: I agree with that. When I do something creative, like 
writing or just, um, doodling, I feel more relaxed. It’s a way to forget stress for a little bit. My cousin 
started photography last year, and—uh—she told me it helped a lot with her anxiety. Also, you get 
a small feeling of achievement. Like, when I finish a project, I feel proud and, you know, a bit happier. 
Creative activities also help people meet others. For example, if you join a dance class, you can meet 
new people. So yeah, creativity is good for mental health. People should do more creative things 
because it make them feel better.

Comments: This response is strong because it fully addresses the question, clearly stating agreement 
and giving several reasons supported by personal examples, including writing, doodling, and a reference 
to the cousin’s experience with taking photos. The ideas are organized in a logical way, moving from 
stress relief to a sense of achievement and then to social benefits. Delivery is generally smooth and 
easy to follow and fillers such as “um” and “uh” are natural and do not interfere with meaning. There 
is also a minor grammar slip (“it make them feel better”), which does not hinder comprehension. 
Vocabulary, though often simple, is appropriate, and the sentence structures support clear 
communication throughout. Despite a few imperfections, the response shows good development and 
effectively explains the speaker’s opinion. 
11. Video 4 Transcript: Good points. One final question. Do you think future schools will teach more art 
or less? What factors might influence this? 
Play Track 94 to hear a sample student response.  
 
Sample Student Response Listening Script: Hmm… it depends, but maybe future schools will teach 
more art. People understand now that creativity is important, not just for artists but for everyone. With 
technology growing so fast, students need to think in new ways… and art helps with that. Also, many 
jobs want people who can solve problems creatively, not just follow rules. So, schools might add more 
art classes. But… um, some schools might focus more on science and coding because of job markets. 
It also depending on the country and budget. If schools have enough money, they can support art 
programs, but if not, they might cut them. Still, I hope schools teach more art in the future. 
Comments: This response fully addresses the question, predicting that schools may teach more art 
and explaining multiple influencing factors such as technology, job market demands, and funding. The 
ideas are logically organized, moving from reasons for more art to possible limitations and ending with a 
personal hope. Delivery is generally smooth and natural, and there are fillers like “um” and slight pauses 
as the speaker gathers thoughts. The grammar slip (“It also depending on…”) does not hinder meaning. 
Vocabulary is varied (“creativity,” “solve problems creatively,” “budget”), and sentence structures are 
flexible, supporting clarity and fluency overall. Despite minor imperfections, the response demonstrates 
strong topic development and effective language use.
