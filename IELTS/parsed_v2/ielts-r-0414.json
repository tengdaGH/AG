        "content": "Most of the courses at Canterbury College only take up four days of the week, leaving one day free for independent study. The atmosphere at the College is that of an adult environment where a relationship of mutual respect is encouraged between students and tutors. Canterbury is a student city with several institutes of Further and Higher Education. The city centre is just a five-minute walk from the College, easily accessible in lunch or study breaks. Canterbury College has developed strong international links over the years and, as a result, many students have the opportunity of visiting and working in a European country in the course of their studies."

        "content": "All students are automatically members of the Canterbury College Students' Union (CCSU) and can attend meetings. The Union is very active and is run by an Executive Committee elected by students in the Autumn Term. The President is elected every Summer Term to provide continuity for the next academic year. Representatives from each area of study form the Student Representative Council (SRC) which allows every student a say in Union affairs. In addition to representing students internally in the College on the Academic Board and with a subcommittee of the College Corporation, the CCSU also belongs to the National Union of Students which represents the interests of students nationally. The Union also arranges and supports entertainments, sporting activities and trips."
