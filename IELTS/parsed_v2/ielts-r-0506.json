The rapid disappearance of the kiwis started when man came to settle here. They brought along with them dogs, cats and Australian possums. Besides man, these animals also like to kill and eat kiwis. Thus reducing the numbers of this nocturnal bird. Many people who are concern to conserve the kiwi predict that it may disappear completely in less than 10 years."

The kiwi is very special to the New Zealanders. It has become the country's national symbol as one can see a picture of a kiwi on New Zealand money. Apart from that, people from New Zealand are sometimes called kiwis."
