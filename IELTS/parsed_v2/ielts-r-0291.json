Closer inspection revealed sky-light window among the thistles, and when amazed investigators moved down the side of the hill they came across a pine door complete with leaded diamond glass and a brass knocker set into an underground building. The Siegmunds had managed to live undetected for six years outside the border town of Hilvarenbeek in Holland. They are the latest in a clutch of individualistic homemakers who have burrowed underground in search of tranquillity."

But subterranean suburbia, Dutch-style, is about to become respectable and chic. Seven luxury homes cosseted away inside a high earth-covered noise embankment next to the main Tilburg city road recently went on the market for $296,500 each. The foundations have yet to be dug, but customers queued up to buy the unusual part-submerged houses, whose back wall is a grassy mound and whose front is a long glass gallery."

It is already proving a way of life in extreme climates. In the winter months in Montreal, Canada, for instance, citizens can escape the cold in an underground complex complete with shops and even health clinics. In Tokyo builders are planning a massive underground city to be begun in the next decade, and underground shopping malls are already common in Japan, where 90 percent of the population is squeezed into 20 percent of the landspace."

Indeed many of the buildings which consume most land - such as cinemas, supermarkets, theatres, warehouses or libraries - have no need to be on the surface since they do not need windows."

A development of 194 houses which would take up 14 hectares of land above ground would occupy 2.7 hectares below it, while the number of roads would be halved. Under several metres of earth, noise is minimal and insulation is excellent. “We get 40 to 50 enquiries a week,” says Peter Carpenter, secretary of the British Earth Sheltering Association, which builds similar homes in Britain. \"People see this as a way of building for the future.\" An underground dweller himself, Carpenter has never paid a heating bill, thanks to solar panels and natural insulation."

But the Dutch development was greeted with regional relief by South Limburg planners because of Holland's chronic shortage of land. It was the Tilburg architect Jo Hurkmans who hit on the idea of making use of noise embankments on main roads. His two-storey, four-bedroomed, two-bathroomed detached homes are now taking shape. \"They are not so much built in a hill as in it,\" he says. \"All the light will come through the glass front, which runs from the second floor down to the ground. Areas which do not need much natural lighting are at the back. The living accommodation is at the front so nobody notices that the back is dark.\""

A terrace of five homes, Britain's first subterranean development, is under way in Nottinghamshire. Italy's outstanding example of subterranean architecture is the Olivetti residential centre in Ivrea. Commissioned by Roberto Olivetti in 1969, it comprises 82 one-bedroomed apartments and 12 maisonettes and forms a house/hotel for Olivetti employees. It is built into a hill and little can be seen from outside except a glass facade. Patrizia Vallecchi, a resident since 1992, says it is little different from living in a conventional apartment."

During a heatwave they took to sleeping there. \"We settled into peace and so close to nature,\" he says. \"Gradually I began adding to the rooms. It sounds strange but being so close to the earth we draw strength from its vibrations. Our children love it; not every child can boast of being watched through their playroom windows by rabbits.\""
