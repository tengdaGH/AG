The Value of a College Degree

The escalating cost of higher education is causing many to question the value of continuing
education beyond high school. Many wonder whether the high cost of tuition, the
opportunity cost of choosing college over full-time employment, and the accumulation of
thousands of dollars of debt is, in the long run, worth the investment.

The risk is especially large for low- income families who have a difficult time making ends
meet without the additional burden of college tuition and fees.

In order to determine whether higher education is worth the investment, it is useful to
examine what is known about the value of higher education and the rates of return on
investment to both the individual and to society.

~THE ECONOMIC VALUE OF HIGHER EDUCATION

There is considerable support for the notion that the rate of return on investment in higher
education is high enough to warrant the financial burden associated with pursuing a college
degree. Though the earnings differential between college and high school graduates varies
over time, college graduates, on average, earn more than high school graduates.

According to the Census Bureau, over an adult's working life, high school graduates earn
an average of $1.2 million; associate’s degree holders earn about $1.6 million; and
bachelor’s degree holders earn about $2.1 million (Day and Newburger, 2002).

These sizeable differences in lifetime earnings put the costs of college study in realistic
perspective. Most students today—about 80 percent of all students—enroll either in public
four- year colleges or in public two-year colleges. According to the U.S. Department of
Education report. Think College Early, a full-time student at a public four-year college pays
an average of $8,655 for in-state tuition, room, and board (U.S. Department of Education,
2002). A fulltime student in a public two-year college pays an average of $1,359 per year in
tuition (U.S. Department of Education, 2002).

These statistics support the contention that, though the cost of higher education is
significant, given the earnings disparity that exists between those who earn a bachelor's
degree and those who do not, the individual rate of return on investment in higher
education is sufficiently high to warrant the cost.

~OTHER BENEFIT! OF HIGHER EDUCATION

College graduates also enjoy benefits beyond increased income. A1998 report published
by the Institute for Higher Education Policy reviews the individual benefits that college
graduates enjoy, including higher levels of saving, increased personal/professional mobility,
improved quality of life for their offspring, better consumer decision making, and more
hobbies and leisure activities (Institute for Higher Education Policy, 1998). According to a
report published by the Carnegie Foundation, nonmonetary individual benefits of higher
education include the tendency for postsecondary students to become more open-minded,
more cultured, more rational, more consistent, and less authoritarian; these benefits are
also passed along to succeeding generations (Rowley and Hurtado, 2002). Additionally,
college attendance has been shown to "decrease prejudice, enhance knowledge of world
affairs and enhance social status" while
increasing economic and job security for those who earn bachelor’s degrees (Ibid.).
Research has also consistently shown a positive correlation between completion of higher
education and good health, not only for oneself, but also for one’s children. In fact,
"parental schooling levels (after controlling for differences in earnings) are positively
correlated with the health status of their children" and Increased schooling (and higher
relative income) are correlated with lower mortality rates for given age brackets" (Cohn and
Geske, 1992).

~THE SOCIAL VALUE OF HIGHER EDUCATION
A number of studies have shown a high correlation between higher education and cultural
and family values, and economic growth. According to Elchanan Cohn and Terry Geske
(1992), there is the tendency for more highly educated women to spend more time with
their children; these women tend to use this time to better prepare their children for the
future. Cohn and Geske (1992) report that "college graduates appear to have a more
optimistic view of their past and future personal progress."

Public benefits of attending college include increased tax revenues, greater workplace
productivity, increased consumption, increased workforce flexibility, and decreased reliance
on government financial support (Institute for Higher Education Policy, 1998)....

CONCLUSION

While it is clear that investment in a college degree, especially for those students in the
lowest income brackets, is a financial burden, the long-term benefits to individuals as well
as to society at large, appear to far outweigh the costs.
