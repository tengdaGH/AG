Learning color words

Young children struggle with color concepts, and the reason for this may have something to
do with how we use the words that describe them.

A In the course of the first few years of their lives, children who are brought up in English-
speaking homes successfully master the use of hundreds of words. Words for objects,
actions, emotions, and many other aspects of the physical world quickly become part of
their infant repertoire. For some reason, however, when it comes to learning color words,
the same children perform very badly. At the age of four months, babies can
distinguish between basic color categories. Yet it turns out they do this in much the same
way as blind children. "Blue" and "yellow" appear in older children's expressive language in
answer to questions such as "What color is this?", but their mapping of objects to individual
colors is haphazard and interchangeable. If shown a blue cup and asked about its color,
typical two-year-olds seem as likely to come up with "red" as "blue." Even after hundreds of
training trials, children as old as four may still end up being unable to accurately sort
objects by color.

B In an effort to work out why this is, cognitive scientists at Stanford University in California
hypothesized that children's incompetence at color-word learning may be directly linked to
the way these words are used in English. While word order for color adjectives varies, they
are used overwhelmingly in pre-nominal position (e.g. "blue cup"); in other words, the
adjective comes before the noun it is describing. This is in contrast to post-nominal position

(e.g. "The cup is blue") where the adjective comes after the noun. It seems that the
difficulty children have may not be caused by any unique property of color, or indeed, of the
world. Rather, it may simply come down to the challenge of having to make predictions
from color words to the objects they refer to, instead of being able to make predictions from
the world of objects to the color words.
To illustrate, the word "chair" has a meaning that applies to the somewhat varied set of
entities in the world that people use for sitting on. Chairs have features, such as arms and
legs and backs, that are combined to some degree in a systematic way; they turn up in a
range of chairs of different shapes, sizes, and ages. It could be said that children learn to
narrow down the set of cues that make up a chair and in this way they learn the concept
associated with that word. On the other hand, color words tend to be unique and not bound
to other specific co-occurring features; there is nothing systematic about color words to
help cue their meaning. In the speech that adults direct at children, color adjectives occur
pre-nominally ("blue cup") around 70 percent of the time. This suggests that most of what
children hear from adults will, in fact, be unhelpful in learning what color words refer to.

C To explore this idea further, the research team recruited 41 English children aged
between 23 and 29 months and carried out a three- phase experiment. It consisted of a
pre-test, followed by training in the use of color words, and finally a post-test that was
identical to the pre-test. The pre- and post-test materials comprised six objects that were
novel to the children. There were three examples of each object in each of three
colors—red, yellow, and blue. The objects were presented on trays, and in both tests, the
children were asked to pick out objects in response to requests in which the color word was
either a prenominal ("Which is the red one?") or a post-nominal ("Which one is red?").

In the training, the children were introduced to a "magic bucket" containing five sets of
items familiar to 26-month-olds (balls, cups, crayons, glasses, and toy bears) in each of the
three colors. The training was set up so that half the children were presented with the items
one by one and heard them labelled with color words used pre-nominally ("This is a red
crayon"), while the other half were introduced to the same items described with a post-
nominal color word ("This crayon is red"). After the training, the children repeated the
selection task on the unknown items in the post-test. To assess the quality of children's
understanding of the color words, and the effect of each type of training, correct choices on
items that were consistent across the pre- and post-tests were used to measure children's
color knowledge.

D Individual analysis of pre- and post-test data, which confirmed parental vocabulary
reports, showed the children had at least some knowledge of the three colour words: they
averaged two out of three correct choices in response to both pre- and post-nominal
question types, which, it has been pointed out, is better than chance. When children's
responses to the question types were assessed independently, performance was at its
most consistent when children were both trained and tested on post-nominal adjectives,
and worst when trained on pre-nominal adjectives and tested on post-nominal adjectives.

Only children who had been trained with post- nominal color-word presentation and then
tested with post-nominal question types were significantly more accurate than chance.
Comparing the pre- and post-test scores across each condition revealed a significant
decline in performance when children were both pre- and post-tested with questions that
placed the color words pre-nominally.

As predicted, when children are exposed to color adjectives in post-nominal position, they
learn them rapidly (after just five training trials per color); when they are presented with
them pre-nominally, as English overwhelmingly tends to do, children show no signs of
learning.

Questions 5-9

Choose NO MORE THAN TWO WORDS from the passage for each answer.

The Hypothesis


Children learn many words quite quickly, but their ability to learn colour words takes longer
than expected.

In fact, despite 5..................... many four-year olds still struggle to arrange objects into
colour categories.
Scientists have hypothesised that this is due to the 6..................... of the adjectives in a
phrase or sentence and the challenges this presents.
While objects consist of a number of 7..................... that can be used to recognise other
similar objects, the 8..................... of a colour cannot be developed using the same
approach. As a consequence, the way colour words tend to be used in English may be
9..................... to children.

Questions 10-11

Which TWO of the following statements about the experiment are true?

A The children were unfamiliar with the objects used in the pre- and post-test.

B The children had to place the pre- and post-test objects onto coloured trays.

C The training was conducted by dividing the children into two groups.

D Pre-nominal questions were used less frequently than post-nominal questions in the
training.

E The researchers were looking for inconsistencies in children's knowledge ot word order.


Questions 12-13

Which TWO of the following outcomes are reported in the passage?

A Average results contradicted parental assessment of children’s knowledge.

tested using post-nominal adjectives.

tests.
