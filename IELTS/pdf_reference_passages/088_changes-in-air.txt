Changes in Air

A A federal ban on ozone-depleting chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), to conform with the Clean
Air Act, is, ironically, affecting 22.9 million people in the U.S. who suffer from asthma.
Generic inhaled albuterol, which is the most commonly prescribed short-acting asthma
medication and requires CFCs to propel it into the lungs, will no longer be legally sold after
December 31,
2008. Physicians and patients are questioning the wisdom of the ban, which will have an
insignificant effect on ozone but a measurable impact on wallets: the reformulated brand-
name alternatives can be three times as expensive, raising the cost to about $40 per
inhaler. The issue is even more disconcerting considering that asthma disproportionately
affects the poor and that, according to recent surveys, an estimated 20 percent of asthma
patients are uninsured.


B “The decision to make the change was political, not medical or scientific,” says
pharmacist Leslie Hendeles of the University of Florida, who co-authored a 2007 paper in
the New England Journal of Medicine explaining the withdrawal and transition. In 1987
Congress signed on to the Montreal Protocol on Substances That Deplete the Ozone
Layer, an international treaty requiring the phasing out of all nonessential uses of CFCs. At
that time, medical inhalers were considered an essential use because no viable
alternative propellant existed. In 1989 pharmaceutical companies banded together and
eventually, in 1996, reformulated albuterol with hydrofluoroalkane.


C The transition began quietly, but as more patients see their prescriptions change and
costs go up, many question why this ban must begin before generics become available.
At least one member of the FDA advisory committee, Nicholas J. Gross of the Stritch-
Loyola School of Medicine, has publicly regretted the decision, recanting his support and
requesting that the ban be pushed back until 2010, when the first patent expfres.

D Gross notes that the decision had nothing to do with the envfronment. Albuterol inhalers
contributed less than 0.1 percent of the CFCs released when the treaty was signed. “It’s a
symbolic issue,” Gross remarks. Some skeptics instead point to the billions of dollars to be
gained by the three companies holding the patents on the available HFA-albuterol inhalers,
namely Glaxo-SmithKline, Schering-Plough and Teva. Although the FDA advisory
committee recognized that the expenses would go up, Hendeles says, it also believed that
the companies would help defray the added costs for individuals. Firms, for instance, had
committed to donating a million HFA inhalers to clinics around the country. According to
Hendeles, GlaxoSmithKline did not follow through, although Schering-Plough and Teva did.
GlaxoSmithKline did not respond to requests for comment.

E The issue now, Hendeles says, is that pharmaceutical-grade CFCs are in short supply,
and the public faces the risk of a shortage of albuterol inhalers if the FDA does not continue
promoting the production of HFA inhalers. He posits that even costs of generics would go
up as CFCs become scarcer. Gross disagrees, saying that the inhaler shortage and the
closure of CFC manufacturing plants are a result of the ban.

F The HFA inhalers also have encountered resistance because some asthmatics insist that
they do not work as well as the CFC variety. But, Hendeles says, the differences are in the
mechanics and maintenance—unlike CFC inhalers, the HFA versions must be primed more
diligently and rinsed to accommodate the stickier HFA formulation. They also run out
suddenly without the warning with a CFC inhaler, that the device is running low.
“Pharmacists may not tell people of these things, and the doctors don’t know,” Hendeles
says.

G The main public health issue in this decision may be the side effects of the economics,
not the drug chemistry. Multiple studies have shown that raising costs leads to poorer
adherence to treatment. One study discovered that patients took 30 percent less
antiasthma medication when thefr co-pay doubled. In the case of a chronic disease such as
asthma, it is particularly difficult to get people to follow regular treatment plans. “Generally
speaking, for any reason you don’t take medication, cost makes it more likely” that you do
not, comments Michael Chemew, a health policy expert at Harvard Medical School.


H Such choices to forgo medication could affect more than just the patients themselves.
“For example,” Hendeles points out, “in a pregnant mother with untreated asthma, less
oxygen is delivered to the fetus, which can lead to congenital problems and premature
birth.” And considering that the disease disproportionately strike s the poor, what seemed
to be a good, responsible environmental decision might in the end exact an unexpected
human toll.
