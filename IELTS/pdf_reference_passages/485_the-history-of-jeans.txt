The history of jeans

The first people to wear jeans were sailors in the 16th century. Sailors were gone for a long
time. They had to do hard work outside in bad weather. Often their clothes had holes in
them, got thinner or lost color. They needed something strong against wear and tear. Their
clothes had to last longer and stay in good condition. They found this type of cloth during
their trip to India. It was made of thick cotton and was called dungaree. It was dyed indigo.
Indians use the indigo plant to color this type of cloth in factories. Sailors bought dungaree
cloth in outside markets, cut it and wore it on their trips home.
The first jeans were made in Genoa. Genoa is a city in Italy. In the 16th century, Genoa
was very powerful. Its sailors traveled all around the world. The Genoa city decided to
make better pants for their sailors. They used the dungaree cloth because it was sturdy
and strong. The new pants were called 'geanos' or 'jeanos'. Sailors could use it in both wet
and dry weather. They could roll up the pants when cleaning the ship. To clean the pants,
they put them inside a net, threw it in the ocean and dragged the net behind the ship. This
is when they realized their color changes to white. This is how bleached jeans were
invented.

Later French workers in Nimes also made jeans. They used a different type of cloth called
denim. But it was also sturdy and dyed blue, like the jeanos. In 1872, there was a small
cloth merchant in Germany. His name was Levi Strauss. He bought and sold denim from
France but Levi Strauss got into trouble and had to go away to America. In New York Levi
learned how to sew. When he moved to San Francisco, he met many gold diggers. These
men went to find gold in rivers. The weather was often bad and the men were only thin
pants. Levi started to cut pants out of denim. He sold these jeans to the gold diggers, and
they loved them. Soon all factory workers and farmers were wearing jeans too. They were
comfortable and easy to take care of and cheap.

In 1950, popular movie and music stars like Elvis Presley and James Dean started wearing
jeans. Those jeans were really tight and parents didn't like them. But they caught on with
teenagers. Jeans became so popular because they meant freedom. Teenagers wanted to
be independent and to make their own rules. In 1960 they started to decorate their jeans
with flowers and colorful designs, or to tear and rip the jeans.

But in 1980 jeans became very expensive. Famous fashion designers like Calvin Klein
began making designer jeans. They put their name on these jeans. Young people wanted
to wear certain brands to show their style. There was a lot of pressure to keep up with the
trend. Everybody wanted to be fashionable. Jeans were considered the uniform of youth.

You had to wear jeans to be in style.
