AUSTON Health Centre


PATIENT INFORMATION LEAFLET

A Appointments
Please telephone 826969 (8.30am - 5.00pm: Mon - Fri). We suggest that you try to see the
same doctor whenever possible because it is helpful for both you and your doctor to know
each other well. We try hard to keep our appointments running to time, and ask you to be
punctual to help us achieve this; if you cannot keep an appointment, please phone in and
let us know as soon as possible so that it can be used for someone else. Please try to
avoid evening appointments if possible. Each appointment is for one person only. Please
ask for a longer appointment if you need more time.

B Weekends and Nights
Please telephone 823307 and a recorded message will give you the number of the doctor
from the Centre on duty. Please remember this is in addition to our normal working day.
Urgent calls only please. A Saturday morning emergency surgery is available between
9.30am and 10.00am. Please telephone for home visits before 10.00am at weekends.


C Centre Nurses
Liz Stuart, Martina Scott and Helen Stranger are available daily by appointment to help you
with dressings, ear syringing, children's immunisations, removal of stitches and blood tests.
They will also advise on foreign travel, and can administer various injections and blood
pressure checks. For any over 75s unable to attend the clinic, Helen Stranger will make a
home visit. AII three Centre Nurses are available during normal working hours to carry out
health checks on patients who have been on doctors' lists for 3 years.

D New Patients

Within 3 months of registering with the Centre, new patients on regular medication are
invited to attend a health check with their doctor. Other patients can arrange to be seen by
one of the Centre Nurses.

E Services Not Covered
Some services are not covered by the Centre e.g. private certificates, insurance, driving
and sports medicals, passport signatures, school medicals and prescriptions for foreign
travel. There are recommended fees for these set by the National Medical Association.
Please ask at reception.


F Receptionists
Our receptionists provide your primary point of contact-they are all very experienced and
have a lot of basic information at their fingertips. They will be able to answer many of your
initial queries and also act as a link with the rest of the team. They may request brief details
of your symptoms or illness - this enables the doctors to assess the degree of urgency.

G Change of Address
Please remember to let us know if you decide to relocate. It is also useful for us to have a
record of your telephone number.
