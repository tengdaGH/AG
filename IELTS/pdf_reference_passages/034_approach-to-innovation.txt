Approach to innovation

People tend to think that any new technology or device is an act of genius; something that
has required vision and insight to create and then develop into a marketable product. The
fact is that innovations were often already ‘out there’ in the public domain in some form or
another. They tend to evolve from notions that have been around for years but that had not,
until that point, been suitably adapted. One expert calls this the ‘long nose’ approach to
innovation, whereby new concepts come into the world slowly, gradually revealing all they
have to offer.
