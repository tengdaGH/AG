Humpback whale breaks migration record

A whale surprises researchers with her journey. A lone humpback whale travelled more
than 9,800 kilometres from breeding areas in Brazil to those in Madagascar, setting a
record for the longest mammal migration ever documented.

Humpback whales (Megaptera novaeangliae) are known to have some of the longest
migration distances of all mammals, and this huge journey is about 400 kilometres farther
than the previous humpback record. The finding was made by Peter Stevick, a biologist at
the College of the Atlantic in Bar Harbor, Maine.

The whale’s journey was unusual not only for its length, but also because it travelled across
almost 90 degrees of longitude from west to east. Typically, humpbacks move in a north-
south direction between cold feeding areas and warm breeding grounds - and the longest
journeys which have been recorded until now have been between breeding and feeding
sites.

The whale, a female, was first spotted off the coast of Brazil, where researchers
photographed its tail fluke and took skin samples for chromosome testing to determine the
animal's sex. Two years later, a tourist on a whale-watching boat snapped a photo of the
humpback near Madagascar.

To match the two sightings, Stevick’s team used an extensive international catalogue of
photographs of the undersides of tail flukes, which have distinctive markings. Researchers
routinely compare the markings in each new photograph to those in the archive.

The scientists then estimated the animal’s shortest possible route: an arc skirting the
southern tip of South Africa and heading north-east towards Madagascar. The minimum
distance is 9,800 kilometres, says Stevick, but this is likely to be an underestimate,
because the whale probably took a detour to feed on krill in the Southern Ocean near
Antarctica before reaching its destination.

Most humpback-whale researchers focus their efforts on the Northern Hemisphere
because the Southern Ocean near the Antarctic is a hostile environment and it is hard to
get to, explains Rochelle Constantine, who studies the ecology of humpback whales at the
University of Auckland in New Zealand. But, for whales, oceans in the Southern

Hemisphere are wider and easier to travel across, says Constantine. Scientists will
probably observe more long-distance migrations in the Southern Hemisphere as satellite
tracking becomes increasingly common, she adds.

Daniel Palacios, an oceanographer at the University of Hawaii at Manoa, says that the
record-breaking journey could indicate that migration patterns are shifting as populations
begin to recover from near-extinction and the population increases. But the reasons why
the whale did not follow the usual migration routes remain a mystery. She could have been
exploring new habitats, or simply have lost her way. 'We generally think of humpback
whales as very well studied, but then they surprise us with things like this,’ Palacios says.
‘Undoubtedly there are a lot of things we still don’t know about whale migration.’
