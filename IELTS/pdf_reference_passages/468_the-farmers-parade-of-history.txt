The Farmers! Parade of history

A

History of Fanner trading company: In 1909 Robert Laidlaw establishes mail-order
company Laidlaw Leeds in Fort Street, Auckland. Then, Branch expansion: purchase of
Green and Colebrook chain store; further provincial stores in Auckland and Waikato to
follow. Opening of first furniture and boot factory. In 1920, Company now has 29 branches;
Whangarei store purchased. Doors open at Hobson Street for direct selling to public. The
firm establishes London and New York buying offices. With permission from the Harbour
Board, the large FARMERS electric sign on the Wyndham Street frontage is erected.

In 1935, if the merchandise has changed, the language of the catalogues hasn’t Robert
Laidlaw, the Scottish immigrant who established die century-old business, might have been
scripting a modern-day television commercial when he told his earliest customers:

Satisfaction, or your money back. “It was the first money back guarantee ever offered in
New Zealand by any firm,” says Ian Hunter, business historian. “And his mission statement
was, potentially, only the second one ever found in the world.” Laidlaw’s stated aims were
simple to build the greatest business in New Zealand, to simplify every transaction, to
eliminate all delays, to only sell goods it would pay the customer to buy.

This year, the company that began as a mail-order business and now employs 3500 staff
across 58 stores turns 100. Its centenary will be celebrated with the release of a book and
major community fundraising projects, to be announced next week. Hunter, who is writing
the centenary history, says “coming to a Fanners store once a week was a part of the New
Zealand way of life”. By 1960, one in every 10 people had an account with die company. It
was the place where teenage girls shopped for their first bra, where newlyweds purchased
their first dinner sets, where first pay cheques were used to pay off hire purchase furniture,
where Santa paraded every Christmas.

Gary Blumenthal’s mother shopped there, and so does he. The fondest memory for the
Rotorua resident? “We were on holiday in Auckland… I decided that upon the lookout
tower on top of the Farmers building would be a unique place to fit the ring on my new
fiancee’s finger.” The lovebirds, who had to wait for “an annoying youth” to leave the tower
before they could enjoy their engagement kiss, celebrate their 50th wedding anniversary in
June.

Farmers, says Hunter, has always had a heart. This, from a 1993 North & South interview
with a former board chairman, Rawdon Busfield: “One day I was in the Hobson Street shop
and I saw a woman with two small children. They were clean and tidily dressed, but poor,
you could tell. That week we had a special on a big bar of chocolate for one shilling. I heard
the woman say to her boy, ‘no, your penny won’t buy that’. He wasn’t wearing shoes. So I
went up to the boy said,’ Son, have you got your penny? ‘He handed it to me. It was hot
he’d had it in his hand for hours. I took the penny and gave him the chocolate.”

Farmers was once the home of genteel tearooms, children’s playgrounds and an annual
sale of celebration for birthday of Hector the Parrot (the store mascot died, aged 131, in the
1970s his stuffed remains still occupy pride of place at the company’s head office). You
could buy houses from Farmers. Its saddle factory supplied the armed forces, and its
upright grand overstrung pianos offered “the acme of value” according to those early
catalogues hand-drawn by Robert Laidlaw himself. Walk through a Farmers store today
and get hit by bright lights and big brands. Its Albany branch houses 16 international
cosmetics companies. It buys from approximately 500 suppliers, and about 30% of those
are locally owned.

“Eight, 10 years ago,” says current chief executive Rod McDermott, “lots of brands wouldn’t
partner with us. The stores were quite distressed. We were first price point focused, we
weren’t fashion focused. “Remove the rose-tinted nostalgia, and Farmers is, quite simply, a
business, doing business in hard times. Dancing with the Stars presenter Candy Lane
launches a clothing line? “We put a trial on, and we thought it was really lovely, but the
uptake wasn’t what we thought it would be. It’s got to be what the customer wants,” says
McDermott.

He acknowledges retailers suffer in a recession: “We’re celebrating 100 years because we
can and because we should.” Farmers almost didn’t pull through one economic crisis. By
the mid 1980s, it had stores across the country. It had acquired the South Island’s Calder
Mackay chain of stores and bought out Haywrights. Then, with sales topping $375 million, it
was taken over by Chase Corporation. Lincoln Laidlaw, now aged 88, and the son of the
company’s founder, remembers the dark days following the stock market crash and the
collapse of Chase. “I think, once, Farmers was like a big family and all of the people who
worked for it felt they were building something which would ultimately be to their benefit
and to the benefit of New Zealand… then the business was being divided up and so that
kind of family situation was dispelled and it hasn’t been recovered.” For a turbulent few
years, the stores were controlled, first by a consortium of Australian banks and later Deka,
the Maori Development Corporation and Foodland Associated Ltd. In 2003, it went back to
“family” ownership, with the purchase by the James Pascoe Group, owned by David and
Anne Norman the latter being the great-granddaughter of James Pascoe, whose first
business interest was jewellery.

“Sheer power of the brand,” says McDermott, “pulled Farmers through and now we’re
becoming the brand it used to be again.” Farmers was the company that, during World War
n, topped up the wages of any staff member disadvantaged by overseas service. Robert
Laidlaw a committed Christian who came to his faith at a 1902 evangelistic service in
Dunedin concluded his original mission statement with the words, “all at it, always at it,
wins success”. Next week, 58 Farmers stores across the country will announce the local
charities they will raise funds for in their centenary celebration everything from guide dog
services to hospices to volunteer fire brigades will benefit. Every dollar raised by the
community will be matched by the company. “It’s like the rebirth of an icon,” says
McDermott.
