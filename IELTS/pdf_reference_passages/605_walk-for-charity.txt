Walk for charity

Dear Friend,

Please join us for our annual Walk for Charity. Starting in Weldown, you and your friends
can choose a delightful 10, 20 or 30 kilometre route.

The money raised will provide support to help people all over the world. Start collecting
your sponsors now and then simply come along on the day. Please read the instructions
below carefully, especially if you require transport to and from Weldown.

See you on Sunday 14 May,


V Jessop

Walk Co-ordinator

P S. Well done to last year's walkers for helping to raise a grand total of £21,000.
The money has already been used to build a children's playground.

START TIMES:
30 km: 8-10 am 20 km: 8 - 10.30 am

10 km: 8 - 11.30 am

The organisers reserve the right to refuse late-comers.

CLOTHING should be suitable for the weather. If rain is forecast, bring some protection
and be prepared for all eventualities. It is better to wear shoes that have been worn in,
rather than ones that are new.

ROUTE MAPS will be available from the registration point. The route will be sign-posted
and marshalled. Where the route runs along the road, walkers should keep to one side in
single file, facing oncoming traffic at oll times. If you need help along the route, please
inform one of the marshals.
Free car parking available in car parks and on streets in Weldown.

BUSES
For the 10 and 20 km routes, a bus will be waiting at Fenton to take walkers back to
Weldown; The bus will leave every half-hour starting at midday. The service is free and
there is no need to book.
