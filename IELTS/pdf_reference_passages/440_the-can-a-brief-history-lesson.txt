The Can – A Brief History Lesson

A. The story of the can begins in 1795 when Nicholas Appert, a Parisian, had an idea:
why not pack food in bottles like wine? Fifteen years later, after researching and testing his
idea, he published his theory: if food is sufficiently heated and sealed in an airtight
container, it will not spoil. In 1810 Peter Durand, an Englishman, wanted to surpass
Appert’s invention, so he elected to try tin instead of glass. Like glass, tin could be sealed
airtight but tin was not breakable and was much easier to handle. Durand himself did no
canning, but two other Englishmen, Bryan Donkin and John Hall, used Durand’s patent.
After experimenting for more than a year, they set up a commercial canning factory and by
1813 they were sending tins of food to British army and navy authorities for trial.


B. Perhaps the greatest encouragement to the newborn canning industry was the
explosion in the number of new colonial territories. As people and goods were being
transported to all parts of the world, the can industry itself was growing in new territories.
Englishmen who emigrated to America brought their newfound knowledge with them. One
of these was Thomas Kensett, who might fairly be called the father of the can
manufacturing industry in the United States. In 1812 he set up a small plant on the New
York waterfront to can the first hermetically sealed products in the United States.


C. Just before the Civil War, a technical advance by canners enabled them to speed up
production. Adding calcium chloride to the water in which cans were cooked raised the
water temperature, speeding up the canning process. Also for almost 100 years, tin cans
were made by artisans by hand. It was a laborious process, requiring considerable skill and
muscle. As the industrial revolution took hold in the United States, the demand for cans
increased and machines began to replace the artisans’ handiwork. A good artisan could
make only 10 cans a day. True production progress in can-making began in 1922, when
American engineers perfected the body-making process. New methods soon increased
production of cans to as many as 250 a minute.


D. As early as 1940, can manufacturers began to explore the possibility of adapting cans
to package carbonated soft drinks. The can had to be strengthened to accommodate
higher internal can pressures created by carbonation (especially during warm summer
months), which meant increasing the thickness of the metal used in the can ends. Another
concern for the new beverage can was its shelf life. Even small amounts of dissolved tin or
iron from the can could impair the drinking quality of drinks. Also the food acids, including
carbonic, citric and phosphoric, in soft drinks presented a risk for the rapid corrosion of
exposed tin and iron in the can. At this point the can was upgraded by improving the
organic coatings used to line the inside. The can manufacturers then embarked on a
program of material and cost savings by reducing both the amount of steel and the amount
of coating used in can making. These efforts were in part inspired by a new competitor -
aluminum.


E. Beverage cans made from aluminum were first introduced in 1965. This was an
exciting innovation for the packaging industry because the aluminum can was made with
only two pieces - a body and an end. This made production easier. Some of the reasons for
the aluminum can’s acceptance were its ductility, its support of carbonation pressure, its
lighter weight and the fact that aluminum does not rust. Both steel and aluminum cans used
an easy-open end tab but the aluminum tab was much easier to make. Perhaps the most
critical element in the aluminum can’s market success was its recycling value. Aluminum
can recycling excelled economically in the competition with steel because of the
efficiencies aluminum cans realized in making new cans from recycled materials compared
with 100 percent virgin aluminum. Steel did not realize similar economies in the recycling
process.


F. Prior to 1970, can makers, customers and consumers alike were unaware of the impact
that the mining and manufacturing of steel or aluminum had on the environment. The
concept of natural resource preservation was not an issue of great importance and the low
growth of population during these early years further de-emphasized concerns for resource
depletion. Both industries, however, came to realize the importance of reducing their
impact on the environment in the late 1960s and early 1970s as a new environmentally
conscious generation emerged. Manufacturers began to recognize the economics of
recycling, namely lower manufacturing costs from using less material and less energy. By
the 1980s and 1990s, recycling had become a way of life. Aluminum can recycling has
become a billion-dollar business and one of the world’s most successful environmental
enterprises. Over the years, the aluminum can has come to be known as America’s most
recyclable package, with over 60 percent of cans being recycled annually.


G. Advances in can manufacturing technology have also brought us lighter aluminum
cans. In 1972, one pound of aluminum yielded only 21.75 cans. Today, by using less
material to make each can, one pound of aluminum makes approximately 32 cans - a 47
percent improvement. Just the lightening of can ends makes a huge difference. When you
multiply the savings by the 100 billion cans that are made each year, the weight and
savings are phenomenal - over 200 million pounds of aluminum!
