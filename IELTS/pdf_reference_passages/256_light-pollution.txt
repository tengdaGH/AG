Light pollution

{A} If humans were truly at home under the light of the moon and stars, we would go into
darkness happily, the midnight world as visible to us as it is to the vast number of nocturnal
species on this planet. Instead, we are diurnal creatures, with eyes adapted to living in the
sun’s light. This is a basic evolutionary fact, even though most of us don’t think of ourselves
as diurnal beings any more than we think of ourselves as primates or mammals, or
Earthlings. Yet it’s the only way to explain what we’ve done to the night: We’ve engineered
it to receive us by filling it with light.
{B} This kind of engineering is no different than damming a river. Its benefits come with
consequences—called light pollution—whose effects scientists are only now beginning to
study. Light pollution is largely the result of bad lighting design, which allows artificial light
to shine outward and upward into the sky, where it’s not wanted, instead of focusing it
downward, where it is. Ill-designed lighting washes out the darkness of night and radically
alters the light levels and light rhythms—to which many forms of life, including ourselves,
have adapted.


{C} Now most of humanity lives under intersecting domes of reflected, refracted light, of
scattering rays from overlit cities and suburbs, from light-flooded highways and factories.
Nearly all of nighttime Europe is a nebula of light, as is most of the United States and all of

Japan. In the south Atlantic the glow from a single fishing fleet squid fishermen during their
prey with metal halide lamps—can be seen from space, burning brighter, in fact, than
Buenos Aires or Rio de Janeiro.

{D} We’ve lit up the night as if it were an unoccupied country when nothing could be further
from the truth. Among mammals alone, the number of nocturnal species is astonishing.
Light is a powerful biological force, and in many species, it acts as a magnet, a process
being studied by researchers such as Travis Longcore and Catherine Rich, co-founders of
the Los Angeles-based Urban Wildlands Group. The effect is so powerful that scientists
speak of songbirds and seabirds being “captured” by searchlights on land or by the light
from gas flares on marine oil platforms, circling and circling in the thousands until they
drop. Migrating at night, birds are apt to collide with brightly lit tall buildings; immature birds
on their first journey suffer disproportionately.
{E} Insects, of course, cluster around streetlights, and feeding at those insect clusters is
now ingrained in the lives of many bat species. In some Swiss valleys, the European lesser
horseshoe bat began to vanish after streetlights were installed, perhaps because those
valleys were suddenly filled with light-feeding pipistrelle bats. Other nocturnal
mammals—including desert rodents, fruit bats, opossums, and badgers-forage more
cautiously under the permanent full moon of light pollution because they’ve become easier
targets for predators.


{F} Some birds—blackbirds and nightingales, among others—sing at unnatural hours in the
presence of artificial light. Scientists have determined that long artificial days— and
artificially short nights induce early breeding in a wide range of birds. And because a longer
day allows for longer feeding, it can also affect migration schedules. One population of
Bewick’s swans wintering in England put on fat more rapidly than usual, priming them to
begin their Siberian migration early. The problem, of course, is that migration, like most
other aspects of bird behaviour, is a precisely timed biological behaviour. Leaving early
may mean arriving too soon for nesting conditions to be right

{G} Nesting sea turtles, which show a natural predisposition for dark beaches, find fewer
and fewer of them to nest on. Their hatchlings, which gravitate toward the brighter, more
reflective sea horizon, find themselves confused by artificial lighting behind the beach. In

Florida alone, hatchling losses number in the hundreds of thousands every year. Frogs and
toads living near brightly lit highways suffer nocturnal light levels that are as much as a
million times brighter than normal, throwing nearly every aspect of their behaviour out of
joint, including their nighttime breeding choruses.

{H} Of all the pollution we face, light pollution is perhaps the most easily remedied. Simple
changes in lighting design and installation yield immediate changes in the amount of light
spilt into the atmosphere and, often, immediate energy savings.


{I} It was once thought that light pollution only affected astronomers, who need to see the
night sky in all its glorious clarity. And, in fact, some of the earliest civic efforts to control
light pollution—in Flagstaff, Arizona, half a century ago—were made to protect the view
from Lowell Observatory, which sits high above that city. Flagstaff has tightened its
regulations since then, and in 2001 it was declared the first International Dark Sky City. By
now the effort to control light pollution has spread around the globe. More and more cities
and even entire countries, such as the Czech Republic, have committed themselves to
reducing unwanted glare.

{J} Unlike astronomers, most of us may not need an undiminished view of the night sky for
our work, but like most other creatures we do need darkness. Darkness is as essential to
our biological welfare, to our internal clockwork, as light itself. The regular oscillation of
waking and sleep in our lives, one of our circadian rhythms—is nothing less than a
biological expression of the regular oscillation of light on Earth. So fundamental are these
rhythms to our being that altering them is like altering gravity.
