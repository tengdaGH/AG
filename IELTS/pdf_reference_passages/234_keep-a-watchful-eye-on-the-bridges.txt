Keep a Watchful Eye on the Bridges

A Most road and rail bridges are only inspected visually, if at all. Every few months,
engineers have to clamber over the structure in an attempt to find problems before the
bridge shows obvious signs of damage. Technologies developed at Los Alamos National
Laboratory, New Mexico, and Texas A&M University may replace these surveys with
microwave sensors that constantly monitor the condition of bridges.

B “The device uses microwaves to measure the distance between the sensor and the
bridge, much like radar does,” says Albert Migliori, a Los Alamos physicist “Any load on the
bridge – such as traffic induces displacements, which change that distance as the bridge
moves up and down.” By monitoring these movements over several minutes, the
researchers can find out how the bridge resonates. Changes in its behaviour can give an
early warning of damage.

C The Interstate 40 bridge over the Rio Grande river in Albuquerque provided the
researchers with a rare opportunity to text their ideas. Chuck Farrar, an engineer at Los
Alamos, explains: “The New Mexico authorities decided to raze this bridge and replace it.
We were able to mount instruments on it, test it under various load conditions and even
inflict damage just before it was demolished.” In the 1960s and 1970s, 2500 similar bridges
were built in the US. They have two steel girders supporting the load in each section.
Highway experts know that this design is “fracture critical” because a failure in either girder
would cause the bridge to fail.

D After setting up the microwave dish on the ground below the bridge, the Los Alamos
team installed conventional accelerometers at several points along the span to measure its
motion. They then tested the bridge while traffic roared across it and while subjecting it to
pounding from a “shaker”, which delivered precise punches to a specific point on the road.
E “We then created damage that we hoped would simulate fatigue cracks that can occur
in steel girders,” says Farrar. They first cut a slot about 60 centimetres long in the middle of
one girder. They then extended the cut until it reached the bottom of the girder and finally
they cut across the flange – the bottom of the girder’s “I” shape.

F The initial, crude analysis of the bridge’s behaviour, based on the frequency at which
the bridge resonates, did not indicate that anything was wrong until the flange was
damaged. But later the data were reanalysed with algorithms that took into account
changes in the mode shapes of the structure – shapes that the structure takes on when
excited at a particular frequency. These more sophisticated algorithms, which were
developed by Norris Stubbs at Texas A&M University, successfully identified and located
the damage caused by the initial cut.

G “When any structure vibrates, the energy is distributed throughout with some points not
moving, while others vibrate strongly at various frequencies,” says Stubbs. “My algorithms
use pattern recognition to detect changes in the distribution of this energy.” NASA already
uses Stubbs’ method to check the behaviour of the body flap that slows space shuttles
down after they land.

H A commercial system based on the Los Alamos hardware is now available, complete
with the Stubbs algorithms, from the Quatro Corporation in Albuquerque for about
$100,000. Tim Darling, another Los Alamos physicist working on the microwave
interferometer with Migliori, says that as the electronics become cheaper, a microwave
inspection system will eventually be applied to most large bridges in the US. “In a decade I
would like to see a battery or solar-powered package mounted under each bridge,
scanning it every day to detect changes,” he says.

Questions 1-4

Choose the correct letter, A, B, C or D.

Write your answers in boxes 1-4 on your answer sheet.

1 How did the traditional way to prevent damage of the bridges before the invention of
new monitoring system

A Bridges has to be tested in every movement on two points.

B Bridges has to be closely monitored by microwave devices.

C Bridges has already been monitored by sensors.
D Bridges has to be frequently inspected by professional workers with naked eyes.


2 How does the new microwave monitors find out the problems of bridges

A by changeling the distance between the positions of devices

B by controlling the traffic flow on the bridges

C by monitoring the distance caused by traffic between two points

D by displacement of the several critical parts in the bridges


3 Why did the expert believe there is a problem for the design called “fracture critical”

A Engineers failed to apply the newly developed construction materials.

B There was not enough finance to repair the bridges.

C The supporting parts of the bridges may crack and cause the bridge to fail.

D There was bigger traffic load conditions than the designers had anticipated.


4 Defect was not recognized by a basic method in the beginning

A until the mid of faces of bridges has fractures.
B until the damage appears along and down to the flanges.

C until the points on the road have been punched.

D until the frequency of resonates appears disordered.
