The Nature of Genius

There has always been ari interest in geniuses and prodigies. The word ‘genius’, from the
Latin gens (= family) and the term ‘genius’, meaning ‘begetter’, comes from the early
Roman cult of a divinity as the head of the family. In its earliest form, genius
was concerned with the ability of the head of the family, the paterfamilias, to
perpetuate himself. Gradually, genius came to represent a person’s characteristics and
thence an individual’s highest attributes derived from his ‘genius’ or guiding spirit. Today,
people still look to stars or genes, astrology or genetics, in the hope of finding the source
of exceptional abilities or personal characteristics.

The concept of genius and of gifts has become part of our folk culture, and attitudes are
ambivalent towards them. We envy the gifted and mistrust them. In the mythology of
giftedness, it is popularly believed that if people are talented in one area, they must be
defective in another, that intellectuals are impractical, that prodigies burn too brightly too
soon and burn out, that gifted people are eccentric, that they are physical weaklings, that
there’s a thin line between genius and madness, that genius runs in families, that the gifted
are so clever they don’t need special help, that giftedness is the same as having a high IQ,
that some races are more intelligent or musical or mathematical than others, that genius
goes unrecognised and unrewarded, that adversity makes men wise or that people with
gifts have a responsibility to use them. Language has been enriched with such terms as
‘highbrow’, ‘egghead’, ‘blue-stocking’, ‘wiseacre’, ‘know-all’, ‘boffin’ and, for many,
‘intellectual’ is a term of denigration.

The nineteenth century saw considerable interest in the nature of genius, and produced not
a few studies of famous prodigies. Perhaps for us today, two of the most significant aspects
of most of these studies of genius are the frequency with which early encouragement and
teaching by parents and tutors had beneficial effects on the intellectual, artistic or musical
development of the children but caused great difficulties of adjustment later in their lives,
and the frequency with which abilities went unrecognised by teachers and schools.
However, the difficulty with the evidence produced by these studies, fascinating as they are
in collecting together anecdotes and apparent similarities and exceptions, is that they are
not what we would today call norm-referenced. In other words, when, for instance,
information is collated about early illnesses, methods of upbringing, schooling, etc., we
must also take into account information from other historical sources about how common or
exceptional these were at the time. For instance, infant mortality was high and life
expectancy much shorter than today, home tutoring was common in the families of the
nobility and wealthy, bullying and corporal punishment were common at the best
independent schools and, for the most part, the cases studied were members of the
privileged classes. It was only with the growth of paediatrics and psychology in the
twentieth century that studies could be carried out on a more objective, if still not always
very scientific, basis.

Geniuses, however they are defined, are but the peaks which stand out through the mist of
history and are visible to the particular observer from his or her particular vantage point.

Change the observers and the vantage points, clear away some of the mist, and a different
lot of peaks appear. Genius is a term we apply to those whom we recognise for their
outstanding achievements and who stand near the end of the continuum of human abilities
which reaches back through the mundane and mediocre to the incapable. There is still
much truth in Dr Samuel Johnson’s observation, The true genius Is a mind of large general
powers, accidentally determined to some particular direction’. We may disagree with the
‘general’, for we doubt if all musicians of genius could have become scientists of genius or
vice versa, but there is no doubting the accidental determination which nurtured or
triggered their gifts into those channels into which they have poured their powers so
successfully. Along the continuum of abilities are hundreds of thousands of gifted men and
women, boys and girls.

What we appreciate, enjoy or marvel at in thè works of genius or the achievements of
prodigies are the manifestations of skills or abilities which are similar to, but so much
superior to, our own. But that their minds are not different from our own is demonstrated by
the fact that the hard-won discoveries of scientists like Kepler or Einstein become the
commonplace knowledge of schoolchildren and the once outrageous shapes and colours
of an artist like Paul Klee so soon appear on the fabrics we wear. This does not minimise
the supremacy of their achievements, which outstrip our own as the sub-four-minute milers
outstrip our jogging.

To think of geniuses and the gifted as having uniquely different brains is only reasonable If
we accept that each human brain is uniquely different. The purpose of instruction is to
make US even more different from one another, and in the process of being educated we
can learn from the achievements of those more gifted than ourselves. But before we try to
emulate geniuses or encourage our children to do so we should note that some of the
things we learn from them may prove unpalatable. We may envy their achievements and
fame, but we should also recognise the price they may have paid in terms of perseverance,
single-mindedness, dedication, restrictions on their personal lives, the demands upon their
energies and time, and how often they had to display great courage to preserve their
integrity or to make their way to the top.

Genius and giftedness are relative descriptive terms of no real substance. We may, at best,
give them some precision by defining them and placing them in a context but, whatever we
do, we should never delude ourselves into believing that gifted children or geniuses are
different from the rest of humanity, save in the degree to which they have developed the
performance of their abilities.
