Geoff Brash

Geoff Brash, who died in 2010, was a gregarious Australian businessman and
philanthropist who encouraged the young to reach their potential.

Born in Melbourne to Elsa and Alfred Brash, he was educated at Scotch College. His sister,
Barbara, became a renowned artist and printmaker. His father, Alfred, ran the Brash retail
music business that had been founded in 1862 by his grandfather, the German immigrant
Marcus Brasch, specialising in pianos. It carried the slogan ‘A home is not a home without
a piano.’

In his young days, Brash enjoyed the good life, playing golf and sailing, and spending some
months travelling through Europe, having a leisurely holiday. He worked for a time at Myer
department stores before joining the family business in 1949, where he quickly began to
put his stamp on things. In one of his first management decisions, he diverged from his
father’s sense of frugal aesthetics by re-carpeting the old man’s office while he was away.
After initially complaining of his extravagance, his father grew to accept the change and
gave his son increasing responsibility in the business.

After World War II (1939-1945), Brash’s had begun to focus on white goods, such as
washing machines and refrigerators, as the consumer boom took hold. However, while his
father was content with the business he had built, the younger Brash viewed expansion as
vital. When Geoff Brash took over as managing director in 1957, the company had two
stores, but after floating it on the stock exchange the following year, he expanded rapidly
and opened suburban stores, as well as buying into familiar music industry names such as
Allans, Palings and Suttons. Eventually, 170 stores traded across the continent under the

Brash’s banner.
Geoff Brash learned from his father’s focus on customer service. Alfred Brash had also
been a pioneer in introducing a share scheme for his staff, and his son retained and
expanded the plan following the float.
Geoff Brash was optimistic and outward looking. As a result, he was a pioneer in both
accessing and selling new technology, and developing overseas relationships. He sourced
and sold electric guitars, organs, and a range of other modern instruments, as well as
state-of-the-art audio and video equipment. He developed a relationship with Taro
Kakehashi, the founder of Japan’s Roland group, which led to a joint venture that brought
electronic musical devices to Australia.

In 1965, Brash and his wife attended a trade fair in Guangzhou, the first of its kind in China;
they were one of the first Western business people allowed into the country following Mao
Zedong’s Cultural Revolution. He returned there many times, helping advise the Chinese in
establishing a high quality piano factory in Beijing; he became the factory’s agent in
Australia. Brash also took leading jazz musicians Don Burrows and James Morrison to
China, on a trip that reintroduced jazz to many Chinese musicians.

He stood down as Executive Chairman of Brash’s in 1988, but under the new management
debt became a problem, and in 1994 the banks called in administrators. The company was
sold to Singaporean interests and continued to trade until 1998, when it again went into
administration. The Brash name then disappeared from the retail world. Brash was greatly
disappointed by the collapse and the eventual disappearance of the company he had run
for so long. But it was not long before he invested in a restructured Allan’s music business.

Brash was a committed philanthropist who, in the mid-1980s, established the Brash
Foundation, which eventually morphed, with other partners, into the Soundhouse Music
Alliance. This was a not-for-profit organisation overseeing and promoting multimedia music
making and education for teachers and students. The Soundhouse offers teachers and
young people the opportunity to get exposure to the latest music technology, and to use
this to compose and record their own music, either alone or in collaboration. The
organisation has now also established branches in New Zealand, South Africa and Ireland,
as well as numerous sites around Australia.
