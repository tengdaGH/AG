Using the Internet and CD-ROM databases in the Library

Bramley College now has full electronic information resources in the College Library to help
you in your studies. On CD-ROM in the library we have about fifty databases, including
many statistical sources. Want to know the average rainfall in Tokyo or the biggest export
earner of Vanuatu? It's easy to find out. Whether you are in the School of Business or the
School of Art & Design, it's all here for you.


You can conduct your own CD-ROM search for no charge, and you can print out your
results on the library printers using your library photocopying card. Alternatively, you can
download your results to disk, again for no charge, but bring your own formatted floppy disk
or CD-ROM. If you are not sure how to conduct a search for yourself, library staff can do it
for you, but we charge $20 for this service, no matter how long or how short a time it takes.

All library workstations have broadband access to the Internet, so you can find the web-
based information you need quickly and easily If you are unfamiliar with using the Internet,
help is available in several ways. You can start with the online tutorial Netstart; just click on
the Netstart Icon on the Main Menu. The tutorial will take you through the basic steps to
using the Internet, at any time convenient to you. If you prefer, ask one of the librarians for
internet advice (best at quiet times between 9.00am and 11.30am weekdays) or attend one
of the introductory group sessions that are held in the first two weeks of each term. Sign
your name on the list on the Library Bulletin Board to guarantee a place, as they are very
popular.

A word of warning: demand for access to library workstations is very high, so you are
strongly advised to book a workstation, and we have to limit your use to a maximum of one
hour at any one time. Make your booking (for which you will receive a receipt) at the
information Desk or at the enquiry desks in the Media Services Area (Level 1). Also, use of
the computers is limited to Bramley students only, so you may be asked to produce your
Student Identification Card to make a booking, or while using the workstations.
