New ways of teaching history

{A} In technology and the media-driven world, it’s becoming increasingly difficult to get our
students’ attention and keep them absorbed in classroom discussions. This generation, in
particular, has brought a unique set of challenges to the educational table. Whereas youth
are easily enraptured by high-definition television, computers, Pods, video games, and cell
phones, they are less than enthralled by what to them are obsolete textbooks and boring
classroom lectures. The question of how to teach history in a digital age is often
contentious. On the one side, the old guard thinks the professional standards history is in
mortal danger from flash-in-the-pan challenges by the digital that is all show and no
substance. On the other side, the self-styled “disruptors” offer overblown rhetoric about
how digital technology has changed everything while the moribund profession obstructs all
progress in the name of outdated ideals. At least, that’s a parody (maybe not much of one)
of how the debate proceeds. Both supporters and opponents of the digital share more
disciplinary common ground than either admits.

{B} When provided with merely a textbook as a supplemental learning tool, test results
have revealed that most students fail to pinpoint the significance of historical events and
individuals. Fewer still are able to cite and substantiate primary historical sources. What
does this say about the way our educators are presenting information? The quotation
comes from a report of a 1917 test of 668 Texas students. Less than 10 per cent of school-
age children attended high school in 1917; today, enrollments are nearly universal. The
whole world has turned on its head during the last century but one thing has stayed the
same: Young people remain woefully ignorant about history reflected from their history
tests. Guess what? Historians are ignorant too, especially when we equate historical
knowledge with the “Jeopardy” Daily Double. In a test, those specializing in American
history did just fine. But those with specialities in medieval, European and African history
failed miserably when confronted by items about Fort Ticonderoga, the Olive Branch
Petition, or the Quebec Act–all taken from a typical textbook. According to the testers, the
results from the recent National Assessment in History, like scores from earlier tests, show
that young people are “abysmally ignorant” of their own history. Invoking the tragedy of last
September, historian Diane Ravitch hitched her worries about our future to the idea that our
nation’s strength is endangered by youth who do poorly on such tests. But if she were
correct, we would have gone down the tubes in 1917!

{C} There is a huge difference between saying “Kids don’t know the history we want them
to know” and saying “Kids don’t know history at all.” Historical knowledge burrows itself into
our cultural pores even if young people can’t marshal it when faced with a multiple-choice
test. If we weren’t such hypocrites (or maybe if we were better historians) we’d have to
admit that today’s students follow in our own footsteps. For too long we’ve fantasized that
by rewriting textbooks we could change how history is learned. The problem, however, is
not the content of textbooks but the very idea of them. No human mind could retain the
information crammed into these books in 1917, and it can do no better now. If we have
learned anything from history that can be applied to every time period, it is that the only
constant changes. The teaching of history, or any subject for that matter, is no exception.
The question is no longer whether to bring new technologies into everyday education; now,
the question is which technologies are most suitable for the range of topics covered in
junior high and high school history classrooms. Fortunately, technology has provided us
with opportunities to present our Civil War lesson plans or our American Revolution lesson
plans in a variety of new ways.

{D} Teachers can easily target and engage the learners of this generation by effectively
combining the study of history with innovative multimedia. PowerPoint and presentations, in
particular, can expand the scope of traditional classroom discussion by helping teachers to
explain abstract concepts while accommodating students’ unique learning styles.
PowerPoint study units that have been pre-made for history classrooms include all manner
of photos, prints, maps, audio clips, video clips and primary sources which help to make
learning interactive and stimulating. Presenting lessons in these enticing formats helps
technology-driven students retain the historical information they’ll need to know for
standard exams.

{E} Whether you’re covering Revolutionary War lesson plans or World War II lesson plans,
PowerPoint study units are available in formats to suit the needs of your classroom.
Multimedia teaching instruments like PowerPoint software are getting positive results the
world over, framing conventional lectures with captivating written, auditory and visual
content that helps students recall names, dates and causal relationships within a historical
context.


{F} History continues to show us that new times bring new realities. Education is no
exception to the rule. The question is not whether to bring technology into the educational
environment. Rather, the question is which technologies are suitable for U.S. and world
history subjects, from Civil War lesson plans to World War II lesson plans. Whether you’re
covering your American Revolution lesson plans or your Cold War lesson plans,
PowerPoint presentations are available in pre-packaged formats to suit your classroom’s
needs.

{G} Meanwhile, some academic historians hold a different view on the use of technology in
teaching history. One reason they hold is that not all facts can be recorded by film or videos
and literature is relatively feasible in this case. Another challenge they have to be faced
with is the painful process of learning a new technology like the making of PowerPoint and
the editing of audio and video clips which is also reasonable especially to some elderly
historians.
