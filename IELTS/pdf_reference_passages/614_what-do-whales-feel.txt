What Do Whales Feel?

An examination of the functioning of the senses in cetaceans, the group of mammals
comprising whales, dolphins and porpoises

Some of the senses that we and other terrestrial mammals take for granted are either
reduced or absent in cetaceans or fail to function well in water. For example, it appears
from their brain structure that toothed species are unable to smell. Baleen species, on the
other hand, appear to have some related brain structures but it is not known whether these
are functional. It has been speculated that, as the blowholes evolved and migrated to the
top of the head, the neural pathways serving sense of smell may have been nearly all
sacrificed. Similarly, although at least some cetaceans have taste buds, the nerves serving
these have degenerated or are rudimentary.

The sense of touch has sometimes been described as weak too, but this view is probably
mistaken. Trainers of captive dolphins and small whales often remark on their animals’
responsiveness to being touched or rubbed, and both captive and free- ranging cetacean
individuals of all species (particularly adults and calves, or members of the same subgroup)
appear to make frequent contact. This contact may help to maintain order within a group,
and stroking or touching are part of the courtship ritual in most species. The area around
the blowhole is also particularly sensitive and captive animals often object strongly to being
touched there.

The sense of vision is developed to different degrees in different species. Baleen species
studied at close quarters underwater - specifically a grey whale calf in captivity for a year,
and free-ranging right whales and humpback whales studied and filmed off Argentina and

Hawaii - have obviously tracked objects with vision underwater, and they can apparently
see moderately well both in water and in air. However, the position of the eyes so restricts
the field of vision in baleen whales that they probably do not have stereoscopic vision.

On the other hand, the position of the eyes in most dolphins and porpoises suggests that
they have stereoscopic vision forward and downward. Eye position in freshwater dolphins,
which often swim on their side or upside down while feeding, suggests that what vision they
have is stereoscopic forward and upward. By comparison, the bottlenose dolphin has
extremely keen vision in water. Judging from the way it watches and tracks airborne flying
fish, it can apparently see fairly well through the air-water interface as well. And although
preliminary experimental evidence suggests that their in-air vision is poor, the accuracy
with which dolphins leap high to take small fish out of a trainer’s hand provides anecdotal
evidence to the contrary.

Such variation can no doubt be explained with reference to the habitats in which individual
species have developed. For example, vision is obviously more useful to species inhabiting
clear open waters than to those living in turbid rivers and flooded plains. The South
American boutu and Chinese beiji, for instance, appear to have very limited vision, and the
Indian susus are blind, their eyes reduced to slits that probably allow them to sense only
the direction and intensity of light.

Although the senses of taste and smell appear to have deteriorated, and vision in water
appears to be uncertain, such weaknesses are more than compensated for by cetaceans’
well-developed acoustic sense. Most species are highly vocal, although they vary in the
range of sounds they produce, and many forage for food using echolocation1. Large
baleen whales primarily use the lower frequencies and are often limited in their repertoire.
Notable exceptions are the nearly song-like choruses of bowhead whales in summer and
the complex, haunting utterances of the humpback whales. Toothed species in general
employ more of the frequency spectrum, and produce a wider variety of sounds, than
baleen species (though the sperm whale apparently produces a monotonous series of
high-energy clicks and little else). Some of the more complicated sounds are clearly
communicative, although what role they may play in the social life and ‘culture’ of
cetaceans has been more the subject of wild speculation than of solid science.
