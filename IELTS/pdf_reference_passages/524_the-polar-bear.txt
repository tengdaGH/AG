The polar bear

The polar bear is very big white bear. We call it the polar bear because it lives inside the
Artic Circle near the North Pole. There are no polar bears at the South Pole.

The polar bear lives in the snow and ice. At the North Pole, there is only snow, ice, and
water. There is not any land. People cannot see the polar bear in the snow very well
because its coat is yellow-white. It has a very warm coat because the weather is cold north
of the Artic Circle.

This bear is three meters long, and it weighs 450 kilos (Kilograms). It can stand up on its
back legs because it has very wide feet. It can use its front legs like arms. The polar bear
can swim very well. It can swim 120 kilometers out into the water. It catches fish and sea
animals for food. It goes into the sea when it is afraid.

Some people want to kill the polar bear for its beautiful white coat. The governments of the
United States and Russia say that no one can kill polar bears now. They do not want all of
these beautiful animals to die.
