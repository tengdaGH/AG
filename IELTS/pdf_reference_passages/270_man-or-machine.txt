Man or Machine

A

During July 2003, the Museum of Science in Cambridge, Massachusetts exhibited what
Honda calls ‘the world’s most advanced humanoid robot’, ASIMO (the Advanced Step in
Innovative Mobility). Honda’s brainchild is on tour in North America and delighting
audiences wherever it goes. After 17 years in the making, ASIMO stands at four feet tall,
weighs around 115 pounds and looks like a child in an astronaut’s suit. Though it is difficult
to see ASIMO’s face at a distance, on closer inspection it has a smile and two large ‘eyes’
that conceal cameras. The robot cannot work autonomously – its actions are ‘remote-
controlled’ by scientists through the computer in its backpack. Yet watching AIMIO perform
at a show in Massachusetts it seemed uncannily human. The audience cheered as ASIMO
walked forwards and backwards, side to side and up and downstairs. After the show, a
number of people told me that they would like robots to play more of a role in daily life –
one even said that the robot would be like ‘another person’.

While the Japanese have made huge strides in solving some of the engineering problems
of human kinetics and bipedal movements, for the past 10 years scientists at MIT’s former
Artificial Intelligence (AI) lab (recently renamed the Computer Science and Artificial
Intelligence Laboratory, CSAIL) have been making robots that can behave like humans and
interact with humans. One of MIT’s robots, Kismet, is an anthropomorphic head and has
two eyes (complete with eyelids), ears, a mouth, and eyebrows. It has several facial
expressions, including happy, sad, frightened and disgusted. Human interlocutors are able
to read some of the robot’s facial expressions, and often change their behavior towards the
machine as a result – for example, playing with it when it appears ‘sad’. Kismet is now in
MIT’s museum, but the ideas developed here continue to be explored in new robots.

C

Cog (short for Cognition) is another pioneering project from MIT’s former AI lab. Cog has a
head, eyes, two arms, hands and a torso – and its proportions were originally measured
from the body of a researcher in the lab. The work on Cog has been used to test theories of
embodiment and developmental robotics, particularly getting a robot to develop intelligence
by responding to its environment via sensors, and to learn through these types of
interactions.

D

MIT is getting furthest down the road to creating human-like and interactive robots. Some
scientists argue that ASIMO is a great engineering feat but not an intelligent machine –
because it is unable to interact autonomously with unpredictabilities in its environment in
meaningful ways, and learn from experience. Robots like Cog and Kismet and new robots
at MIT’s CSAIL and media lab, however, are beginning to do this.

E

These are exciting developments. Creating a machine that can walk, make gestures and
learn from its environment is an amazing achievement. And watch this space: these
achievements are likely rapidly to be improved upon. Humanoid robots could have a
plethora of uses in society, helping to free people from everyday tasks. In Japan, for
example, there is an aim to create robots that can do the tasks similar to an average
human and also act in more sophisticated situations as firefighters, astronauts or medical
assistants to the elderly in the workplace and in homes – partly in order to counterbalance
the effects of an ageing population.

F
Such robots say much about the way in which we view humanity, and they bring out the
best and worst of us. On one hand, these developments express human creativity – our
ability to invent, experiment, and to extend our control over the world. On the other hand,
the aim to create a robot like a human being is spurred on by dehumanized ideas – by the
sense that human companionship can be substituted by machines; that humans lose their
humanity when they interact with technology; or that we are a little more than surface and
ritual behaviors, that can be simulated with metal and electrical circuits.
