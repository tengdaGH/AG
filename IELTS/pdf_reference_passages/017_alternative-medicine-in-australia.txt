Alternative Medicine in Australia

The first students to study alternative medicine at university level in Australia began their
four-year, full-time course at the University of Technology, Sydney, in early 1994. Their
course covered, among other therapies, acupuncture. The theory they learnt is based on
the traditional Chinese explanation of this ancient healing art: that it can regulate the flow of
‘Qi’ or energy through pathways in the body. This course reflects how far some alternative
therapies have come in their struggle for acceptance by the medical establishment.


Australia has been unusual in the Western world in having a very conservative attitude to
natural or alternative therapies, according to Dr Paul Laver, a lecturer in Public Health at
the University of Sydney. ‘We’ve had a tradition of doctors being fairly powerful and I guess
they are pretty loath to allow any pretenders to their position to come into it.’ In many other
industrialized countries, orthodox and alternative medicines have worked ‘hand in glove’ for
years. In Europe, only orthodox doctors can prescribe herbal medicine. In Germany, plant
remedies account for 10% of the national turnover of pharmaceutical. Americans made
more visits to alternative therapist than to orthodox doctors in 1990, and each year they
spend about $US 12 billion on the therapies that have not been scientifically tested.

Disenchantment with orthodox medicine has seen the popularity of alternative therapies in
Australia climb steadily during the past 20 years. In a 1983 national health survey, 1.9% of
people said they had contacted a chiropractor, naturopath, osteopath, acupuncturist or
herbalist in the two weeks prior to the survey. By 1990, this figure had risen to 2.6% of the
population. The 550,000 consultations with alternative therapists reported in the 1990
survey represented about an eighth of the total number of consultations with medically
qualified personnel covered by the survey, according to Dr Laver and colleagues writing in
the Australian Journal of Public Health in 1993. ‘A better educated and less accepting
public has become disillusion with the experts in general and increasingly skeptical about
science and empirically based knowledge,’ they said. ‘The high standing of professionals,
including doctors, has been eroded as a consequence.’

Rather than resisting or criticizing this trend, increasing numbers of Australian doctors,
particularly younger ones, are forming group practices with alternative therapists or taking
courses themselves, particularly in acupuncture and herbalism. Part of the incentive was
financial, Dr Laver said. ‘The bottom line is that most general practitioners are business
people. If they see potential clientele going elsewhere, they might want to be able to offer a
similar service.’

In 1993, Dr Laver and his colleagues published a survey of 289 Sydney people who
attended eight alternative therapists’ practices in Sydney. These practices offered a wide
range of alternative therapies from 25 therapists. Those surveyed had experience chronic
illnesses, for which orthodox medicine had been able to provide little relief. They
commented that they liked the holistic approach of their alternative therapists and the
friendly, concerned and detailed attention they had received. The cold, impersonal manner
of orthodox doctors featured in the survey. An increasing exodus from their clinics, coupled
with this and a number of other relevant surveys carried out in Australia, all pointing to
orthodox doctors’ inadequacies, have led mainstream doctors themselves to begin to admit
they could learn from the personal style of alternative therapists. Dr Patrick Store,
President of the Royal College of General Practitioners, concurs that orthodox doctors
could learn a lot about beside manner and advising patients on preventative health from
alternative therapists.

According to the Australian Journal of Public Health, 18% of patients visiting alternative
therapists do so because they suffer from musculo-skeletal complaints; 12% suffer from
digestive problems, which is only 1% more than those suffering from emotional problems.
Those suffering from respiratory complaints represent 7% of their patients, and candida
sufferers represent an equal percentage. Headache sufferers and those complaining of
general ill health represent 6% and 5% of patients respectively, and a further 4% see
therapists for general health maintenance.

The survey suggested that complementary medicine is probably a better term than
alternative medicine. Alternative medicine appears to be an adjunct, sought in times of
disenchantment when conventional medicine seems not to offer the answer.
