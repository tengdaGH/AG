How does the biological clock tick?

A

Our life span is restricted. Everyone accepts this as ‘biologically’ obvious. ‘Nothing lives for
ever!’ However, in this statement we think of artificially produced, technical objects,
products which are subjected to natural wear and tear during use. This leads to the result
that at some time or other the object stops working and is unusable (‘death’ in the biological
sense). But are the wear and tear and loss of function of technical objects and the death of
living organisms really similar or comparable?

B

Our ‘dead’ products are ‘static’, closed systems. It is always the basic material which
constitutes the object and which, in the natural course of things, is worn down and
becomes ‘older’. Ageing in this case must occur according to the laws of physical chemistry
and of thermodynamics. Although the same law holds for a living organism, the result of
this law is not inexorable in the same way. At least as long as a biological system has the
ability to renew itself it could actually become older without ageing; an organism is an open,
dynamic system through which new material continuously flows. Destruction of old
material and formation of new material are thus in permanent dynamic equilibrium. The
material of which the organism is formed changes continuously. Thus our bodies
continuously exchange old substance for new, just like a spring which more or less
maintains its form and movement, but in which the water molecules are always different.

C

Thus ageing and death should not be seen as inevitable, particularly as the organism
possesses many mechanisms for repair. It is not, in principle, necessary for a biological
system to age and die. Nevertheless, a restricted life span, ageing, and then death are
basic characteristics of life. The reason for this is easy to recognise: in nature, the existent
organisms either adapt or are regularly replaced by new types. Because of changes in the
genetic material (mutations) these have new characteristics and in the course of their
individual lives they are tested for optimal or better adaptation to the
environmental conditions. Immortality would disturb this system - it needs room for new
and better life. This is the basic problem of evolution.

D

Every organism has a life span which is highly characteristic. There are striking differences
in life span between different species, but within one species the parameter is relatively
constant. For example, the average duration of human life has hardly changed in
thousands of years. Although more and more people attain an advanced age as a result of
developments in medical care and better nutrition, the characteristic upper limit for most
remains 80 years. A further argument against the simple wear and tear theory is the
observation that the time within which organisms age lies between a few days (even a few
hours for unicellular organisms) and several thousand years, as with mammoth trees.

E

If a life span is a genetically determined biological characteristic, it is logically necessary to
propose the existence of an internal clock, which in some way measures and controls the
ageing process and which finally determines death as the last step in a fixed programme.
Like the life span, the metabolic rate has for different organisms a fixed mathematical
relationship to the body mass. In comparison to the life span this relationship is ‘inverted’:
the larger the organism the lower its metabolic rate. Again this relationship is valid not only
for birds, but also, similarly on average within the systematic unit, for all other
organisms (plants, animals, unicellular organisms).

F
Animals which behave ‘frugally’ with energy become particularly old, for example,
crocodiles and tortoises. Parrots and birds of prey are often held chained up. Thus they are
not able to ‘experience life’ and so they attain a high life span in captivity. Animals which
save energy by hibernation or lethargy (e.g. bats or hedgehogs) live much longer than
those which are always active. The metabolic rate of mice can be reduced by a very low
consumption of food (hunger diet). They then may live twice as long as their well fed
comrades. Women become distinctly (about 10 per cent) older than men. If you
examine the metabolic rates of the two sexes you establish that the higher male metabolic
rate roughly accounts for the lower male life span. That means that they live life
‘energetically’ - more intensively, but not for as long.

G

It follows from the above that sparing use of energy reserves should tend to extend life.
Extreme high performance sports may lead to optimal cardiovascular performance, but
they quite certainly do not prolong life. Relaxation lowers metabolic rate, as does adequate
sleep and in general an equable and balanced personality. Each of us can develop his or
her own ‘energy saving programme’ with a little self-observation, critical self-control
and, above all, logical consistency. Experience will show that to live in this way not only
increases the life span but is also very healthy. This final aspect should not be forgotten.
