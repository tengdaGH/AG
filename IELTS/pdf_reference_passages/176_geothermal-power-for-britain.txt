Geothermal power for Britain

Huge reserves of energy have been found in rocks far below the surface of the ground in
Britain. It is estimated that the north and southwest regions could hold enough energy in
the form of heat to provide power for millions of homes. In fact, up to a fifth of Britain’s
energy could be provided by this geothermal source. Extracting the heat and converting it
into electricity is difficult and expensive. Thousands of bore holes would be needed; but
once they were in place, the heat would keep regenerating indefinitely.
