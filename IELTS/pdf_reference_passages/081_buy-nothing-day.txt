Buy Nothing Day

“Buy Nothing Day” began in the 1990s in Vancouver, Canada. It was the idea of a man
named Kalle Lasn and his organization Adbusters. Before starting Adbusters, Lasn worked
for many years in advertising. He helped companies research what influenced people to
buy things. But Lasn began to question the ways advertisers influenced people to buy
things. He also questioned the culture of buying. Was it good to make people feel like they
should always want more and more? “Buy Nothing Day” criticizes this culture of
consumerism.
Lasn recognizes that people need to consume things. They have to buys things to eat, live
and even enjoy life. But Lasn believes that many companies encourage people to consume
far more than is necessary. Advertising this way helps companies make money. But Lasn
believes it hurts people and culture.

So Lasn decided to use advertising against companies. Adbusters tries to help people
understand some of the false values and ideas behind advertising. The main value
Adbusters fights is the idea, "You must consume more to be happy." And one way they do
this is by encouraging people to celebrate “Buy Nothing Day!”

“Buy Nothing Day” is celebrated on the fourth Friday of every November. Adbusters chose
this day for a very important reason. It is the biggest buying day of the year. Advertisers call
this day Black Friday.

Black Friday is particularly famous in the United States. It is the day after the country’s
Thanksgiving holiday. On Thanksgiving, people in the United States gather with family and
friends to eat a meal and give thanks. In recent years, stores began to reduce their prices
the day after Thanksgiving. They wanted to encourage people to start buying gifts for the
Christmas holiday in December.

However, in recent years, Black Friday has become famous for something else: greed and
violence. On Black Friday stores offer extremely reduced prices. But they only offer limited
amounts of product. So, people come early in the morning - or even the night before - to
stand in lines outside stores. Sometimes, people push or fight to be first into the store.
Some people have even died in Black Friday riots!

“Buy Nothing Day” hopes to end the greed and violence of Black Friday. But its message is
bigger than just Black Friday. “Buy Nothing Day” is for people in the United States and
around the world. Many other countries also have growing problems with too much
consumption. Sixty-two different countries, from Germany to Japan, already celebrate “Buy
Nothing Day”. And the message is the same everywhere - buying too much hurts people,
culture and the planet.

Buy Nothing Day is a simple idea. It fights consumer culture by asking us to stop buying for
a day. Anyone can do it if they spend a day without buying. For some people, “Buy Nothing
Day” is a protest. For other people, it is a party. Some groups go to stores and encourage
other people not to buy things. Other people gather together to make Christmas gifts -
instead of buying them. And some people use the day to create works of art that protest
against consumer messages. Often, people celebrate by enjoying the free gift of nature.
They go for walks, or watch the sun set together. The only rule of “Buy Nothing Day” is not
to buy anything!

Some people question if “Buy Nothing Day” can really change culture. It is only one day.
And telling people not to do something often does not work! Other people say that
consumers should not just buy less, but they should buy better. These people encourage
consumers to buy things that are made in ways that do not hurt people or the environment.

But “Buy Nothing Day” does get people thinking about the negative effects of buying too
much. A lot of people have had deep learning experiences when they tried celebrating “Buy
Nothing Day”. It was like giving up an addiction to drugs.

Buying more and more things can be like an addiction. Often, the more people buy things,
the more things they want. People are happier and more satisfied when they spend money
on experiences instead of things. Satisfaction over purchases decreases over time. A new
car does not stay new for very long. But a satisfying experience often becomes more
positive over time as we remember it.
