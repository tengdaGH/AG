THE KEYLESS SOCIETY

A

Students who want to enter the University of Montreal's Athletic Complex need more than
just a conventional ID card - their identities must be authenticated by an electronic hand
scanner. In some California housing estates, a key alone is insufficient to get someone in
the door; his or her voice print must also be verified. And soon, customers at some
Japanese banks will have to present their faces for scanning before they can enter the
building and withdraw their money.

All of these are applications of biometrics, a little-known but fast-growing technology that
involves the use of physical or biological characteristics to identify individuals. In use for
more than a decade at some high- security government institutions in the United States
and Canada, biometrics are now rapidly popping up in the everyday world. Already, more
than 10,000 facilities, from prisons to day-care centres, monitor people's fingerprints or
other physical parts to ensure that they are who they claim to be. Some 60 biometric
companies around the world pulled in at least $22 million last year and that grand total is
expected to mushroom to at least $50 million by 1999.

Biometric security systems operate by storing a digitised record of some unique human
feature. When an authorised user wishes to enter or use the facility, the system scans the
person's corresponding characteristics and attempts to match them against those on
record. Systems using fingerprints, hands, voices, irises, retinas and faces are already on
the market. Others using typing patterns and even body odours are in various stages of
development.

D

Fingerprint scanners are currently the most widely deployed type of biometric application,
thanks to their growing use over the last 20 years by law-enforcement agencies. Sixteen
American states now use biometric fingerprint verification systems to check that people
claiming welfare payments are genuine. In June, politicians in Toronto voted to do the
same, with a pilot project beginning next year.

E

To date, the most widely used commercial biometric system is the handkey, a type of hand
scanner which reads the unique shape, size and irregularities of people's hands. Originally
developed for nuclear powerplants, the handkey received its big break when it was used to
control access to the Olympic Village in Atlanta by more than 65,000 athletes, trainers and
support staff Now there are scores of other applications.

Around the world, the market is growing rapidly. Malaysia, for example, is preparing to
equip all of its airports with biometric face scanners to match passengers with luggage. And
Japan's largest maker of cash dispensers is developing new machines that incorporate iris
scanners. The first commercial biometric, a hand reader used by an American firm to
monitor employee attendance, was introduced in 1974. But only in the past few years has
the technology improved enough for the prices to drop sufficiently to make them
commercially viable. 'When we started four years ago, I had to explain to everyone what a
biometric is,' says one marketing expert. Now, there's much more awareness out there.'
G

Not surprisingly, biometrics raise thorny questions about privacy and the potential for
abuse. Some worry that governments and industry will be tempted to use the technology to
monitor individual behaviour. If someone used your fingerprints to match your health-
insurance records with a credit-card record showing you regularly bought lots of cigarettes
and fatty foods,' says one policy analyst, 'you would see your insurance payments go
through the roof.' In Toronto, critics of the welfare fingerprint plan complained that it would
stigmatise recipients by forcing them to submit to a procedure widely identified with
criminals.

Nonetheless, support for biometrics is growing in Toronto as it is in many other
communities. In an increasingly crowded and complicated world, biometrics may well be a
technology whose time has come.
