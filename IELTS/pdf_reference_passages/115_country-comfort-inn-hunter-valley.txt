Country Comfort Inn, Hunter Valley

Use information in the description below to answer Questions 1 to 3. Write your answer in
boxes 1-3 on your answer sheet.


Morpeth is today a small town about two hours’ drive north of Sydney. The town of Morpeth grew from an
original 2000 acres of land given to an English army officer, Lieutenant Edward Close (1790-1866), in 1821.
During the 1830s and 1840s Morpeth became a major river port, due to its favourable location. Produce, hides
and timber were brought to Morpeth from inland New South Wales and shipped down the Hunter river to the
coast and then to Sydney. However, in 1870 a railway line reached the town, and the importance of river
shipping began to decline. Today, Morpeth, with its beautiful old buildings, is a popular tourist destination.
