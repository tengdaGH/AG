Mechanisms of Linguistic Change

A The changes that have caused the most disagreement are those in pronunciation. We
have various sources of evidence for the pronunciations of earlier times, such as the
spellings, the treatment of words borrowed from other languages or borrowed by them, the
descriptions of contemporary grammarians and spelling-reformers, and the modern
pronunciations in all the languages and dialects concerned From the middle of the
sixteenth century, there are in England writers who attempt to describe the position of the
speech-organs for the production of English phonemes, and who invent what are in effect
systems of phonetic symbols. These various kinds of evidence, combined with a
knowledge of the mechanisms of speech-production, can often give us a very good idea of
the pronunciation of an earlier age, though absolute certainty is never possible.

B When we study the pronunciation of a language over any period of a few generations or
more, we find there are always large-scale regularities in the changes: for example, over a
certain period of time, just about all the long [a:] vowels in a language may change into long
[e:] vowels, or all the [b] consonants in a certain position (for example at the end of a word)
may change into [p] consonants. Such regular changes are often called sound laws. There
are no universal sound laws (even though sound laws often reflect universal tendencies),
but simply particular sound laws for one given language (or dialect) at one given period

C It is also possible that fashion plays a part in the process of change. It certainly plays a
part in the spread of change: one person imitates another, and people with the most
prestige are most likely to be imitated, so that a change that takes place in one social group
may be imitated (more or less accurately) by speakers in another group. When a social
group goes up or down in the world, its pronunciation of Russian, which had formerly been
considered desirable, became on the contrary an undesirable kind of accent to have, so
that people tried to disguise it. Some of the changes in accepted English pronunciation in
the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries have been shown to consist in the replacement
of one style of pronunciation by another style already existing, and it is likely that such
substitutions were a result of the great social changes of the period: the increased power
and wealth of the middle classes, and their steady infiltration upwards into the ranks of the
landed gentry, probably carried elements of middle-class pronunciation into upper-class
speech.
D A less specific variant of the argument is that the imitation of children is imperfect: they
copy their parents’ speech, but never reproduce it exactly. This is true, but it is also true
that such deviations from adult speech are usually corrected in later childhood. Perhaps it
is more significant that even adults show a certain amount of random variation in their
pronunciation of a given phoneme, even if the phonetic context is kept unchanged. This,
however, cannot explain changes in pronunciation unless it can be shown that there is
some systematic trend in the failures of imitation: if they are merely random deviations they
will cancel one another out and there will be no net change in the language.

E One such force which is often invoked is the principle of ease, or minimization of effort.
The change from fussy to fuzzy would be an example of assimilation, which is a very
common kind of change. Assimilation is the changing of a sound under the influence of a
neighbouring one. For example, the word scant was once skamt, but the /m/ has been
changed to /n/ under the influence of the following /t/. Greater efficiency has hereby been
achieved, because /n/ and /t/ are articulated in the same place (with the tip of the tongue
against the teeth-ridge), whereas /m/ is articulated elsewhere (with the two lips). So the
place of articulation of the nasal consonant has been changed to conform with that of the
following plosive. A more recent example of the same kind of thing is the common
pronunciation of football as football.

F Assimilation is not the only way in which we change our pronunciation in order to
increase efficiency. It is very common for consonants to be lost at the end of a word: in

Middle English, word-final [-n] was often lost in unstressed syllables, so that baken ‘to bake’
changed from [‘ba:kan] to [‘ba:k3],and later to [ba:k]. Consonant-clusters are often
simplified. At one time there was a [t] in words like castle and Christmas, and an initial [k] in
words like knight and know. Sometimes a whole syllable is dropped out when two
successive syllables begin with the same consonant (haplology): a recent example is
temporary, which in Britain is often pronounced as if it were tempory.

The pronunciation of living language undergo changes throughout thousands of years.
Large scale regular Changes are usually called 1...................... There are three reasons
for these changes. Firstly, the influence of one language on another; when one person
imitates another pronunciation(the most prestige’s), the imitation always partly involving
factor of 2...................... Secondly, the imitation of children from adults1 language
sometimes are 3....................., and may also contribute to this change if there are
insignificant deviations tough later they may be corrected Finally, for those random
variations in pronunciation, the deeper evidence lies in the

Questions 5-11

Do the following statements agree with the information given in Reading Passage?
In boxes 5-11 on your answer sheet, write

TRUE if the statement agrees with the information

FALSE if the statement contradicts the information

NOT GIVEN if there is no information on this

5..................... It is impossible for modern people to find pronunciation of words in an
earlier age

6..................... The great change of language in Russian history is related to the rising
status and fortune of middle classes.

7..................... All the children learn speeches from adults white they assume that certain
language is difficult to imitate exactly.

8..................... Pronunciation with causal inaccuracy will not exert big influence on
language changes.

9..................... The word 'scant' can be pronounced more easily than 'skamt'

10..................... The [g] in gnat not being pronounced will not be spelt out in the future.

11..................... The sound of ‘temporary’ cannot wholly present its spelling.


Questions 12-14

Look at the following sentences and the list of statements below. Match each statement
with the correct sentence, A-D.
Write the correct letter, A-D, in boxes 12-14 on your answer sheet


A Since the speakers can pronounce it with less effort

B Assimilation of a sound under the influence of a neighbouring one

C It is a trend for changes in pronunciation in a large scale in a given period

D Because the speaker can pronounce [n] and [t] both in the same time


12..................... As a consequence, ‘b’ will be pronounced as

13..................... The pronunciation of [mt] changed to [nt]

14..................... The omit of ‘f in the sound of Christmas
