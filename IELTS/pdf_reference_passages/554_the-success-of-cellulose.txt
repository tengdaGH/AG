The success of cellulose

{A} Not too long ago many investors made the bet that renewable fuels from bio-mass
would be the next big thing in energy. Converting corn, sugarcane, and soybeans into
ethanol or diesel-type fuels lessens our nation’s dependence on oil imports while cutting
carbon dioxide emissions. But already the nascent industry faces challenges. Escalating
demand is hiking food prices while farmers clear rainforest habitats to grow fuel crops. And
several recent studies say that certain biofuel-production processes either fail to yield net
energy gains or release more carbon dioxide than they use.


{B} A successor tier of start-up ventures aims to avoid those problems. Rather than
focusing on the starches, sugars, and fats of food crops, many of the prototype bioethanol
processes work with lignocellulose, the “woody” tissue that strengthens the cell walls of
plants, says University of Massachusetts Amherst chemical engineer George W. Huber.
Although cellulose breaks down less easily than sugars and starches and thus requires a
complex series of enzyme-driven chemical reactions, its use opens the industry to nonfood
plant feedstocks such as agricultural wastes, wood chips, and switchgrass. But no
company has yet demonstrated a cost-competitive industrial process for making cellulosic
biofuels.
{C} So scientists and engineers are working on dozens of possible biofuel-processing
routes, reports Charles Wyman, a chemical engineer at the University of California,
Riverside, who is a founder of Mascoma Corporation in Cambridge, Mass., a leading
developer of cellulosic ethanol processing.” There’s no miracle process out there,” he
remarks. And fine-tuning a process involves considerable money and time. “The oil
companies say that it takes 10 years to fully commercialize an industrial processing route,”
warns Huber, who has contributed some thermochemical techniques to another biomass
start-up, Virent Energy Systems in Madison, Wis.

{D} One promising biofuel procedure that avoids the complex enzymatic chemistry to break
down cellulose is now being explored by Coskata in Warrenville, Ill., a firm launched in
2006 by high-profile investors and entrepreneurs (General Motors recently took a minority
stake in it as well). In the Coskata operation, a conventional gasification system will use
heat to turn various feedstocks into a mixture of carbon monoxide and hydrogen called
syngas, says Richard Tobey, vice president of Engineering and R&D. The ability to handle
multiple plant feedstocks would boost the flexibility of the overall process because each
region in the country has access to certain feedstocks but not others.


{E} Instead of using thermochemical methods to convert the syngas to fuel- a process that
can be significantly more costly because of the added expense of pressurizing gases,
according to Tobey – the Coskata group chose a biochemical route. The group focused on
five promising strains of ethanol-excreting bacteria that Ralph Tanner, a microbiologist at
the University of Oklahoma, had discovered years before in the oxygen-free sediments of a
swamp. These anaerobic bugs make ethanol by voraciously consuming syngas.
{F} The “heart and soul of the Coskata process,” as Tobey puts it, is the bioreactor in which
the bacteria live. “Rather than searching for food in the fermentation mash in a large tank,
our bacteria wait for the gas to be delivered to them,” he explains. The firm relies on plastic
tubes, the filter-fabric straws as thin as human hair. The syngas flows through the straws,
and water is pumped across their exteriors. The gases diffuse across the selective
membrane to the bacteria embedded in the outer surface of the tubes, which permits no
water inside. “We get an efficient mass transfer with the tubes, which is not easy,” Tobey
says. “Our data suggest that in an optimal setting we could get 90 percent of the energy
value of the gases into our fuel.” After the bugs eat the gases, they release ethanol into the
surrounding water. Standard distillation or filtration techniques could extract the alcohol
from the water.


{G} Coskata researchers estimate that their commercialized process could deliver ethanol
at under $1 per gallon-less than half of today’s $2-per-gallon wholesale price, Tobey
claims. Outside evaluators of Argonne National Laboratory measured the input-output
“energy balance” of the Coskata process and found that, optimally, it can produce 7.7 times
as much energy in the end product as it takes to make it.

{H} The company plans to construct a 40,000-gallon-a-year pilot plant near the GM test
track in Milford, Mich., by the end of this year and hopes to build a full-scale, 100-million-
gallon-a-year plant by 2011. Coskata may have some company by then; Bioengineering
Resources in Fayetteville, Ark., is already developing what seems to be a similar three-step
pathway in which syngas is consumed by bacteria isolated by James Gaddy, a retired
chemical engineer at the University of Arkansas. Considering the advances in these and
other methods, plant cellulose could provide the greener ethanol everyone wants.
