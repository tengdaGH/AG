SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS - FOOD HANDLERS

Food handlers are those concerned with preparing and serving unwrapped food.
Food handlers should report any instance of sickness, diarrhoea and/or stomach upset experienced either
while at work or during a holiday to a member of the Personnel Management team. Any infections of ear, nose,
throat, mouth, chest or skin should also be reported to a member of the Personnel Management team.
Food handlers need to have an annual dental examination by the company dentist. Alternatively, a current
certificate of dental fitness may be produced from their own dentist. This applies to all permanent staff who
handle food.
