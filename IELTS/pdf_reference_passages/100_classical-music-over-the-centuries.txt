Classical music over the centuries

INDIAN CLASSICAL MUSIC

The origins of Indian classical music can be found from the oldest of scriptures, part of the
Hindus tradition, the Vedas.

Samaveda, one of the four Vedas, describes music at length. Indian classical music has its
origins as a meditation tool for attaining self realization. All different forms of these
melodies (ragas) are believed to affect various “chakras” (energy centers, or “mood”) in the
path of the Kundalini. However, there is little mention of these esoteric beliefs in Bharat’s
Natyashastra , the first treatise laying down the fundamental principles of drama, dance
and music. The Samadeva, one of the four Vedas, created out of riga-veda so that its
hymns could be sung as Samagana, established its first pop.

Indian classical music has one of the most complex and complete musical systems ever
developed. Like Western classical music, it divides the octave s into 12 Semitones of which
the 7 basic notes are Sa Re Ga Ma Pa Dha Ni Sa, replacing Do Re Mi Fa So La Ti Do.
However, it uses the just intonation tuning (unlike western classical music which uses the
equal temperament tuning system).

Indian classical music is monophonic in nature and based around a single melody line
which is played over a fixed drone. The performance is based melodically on particular
rages and rhythmically on talas.

NATIONAL SYSTEM

Scholars of Europe in the seventeenth and eighteenth century were enormed by Indian
music. With no facility to record the sound they explored for some existing system that
might exist system that express sounds in the composition. There were pointers to an
ancient notations system which scholars had also translated into Persian: still’ complexity
of Indian classical music could not be expressed in writing. Though some western scholars
did record compositions in staff notation system, Indian musicians used Pt.Bhakhande
system. Though more accurate, this relies on Devanagari script rather than symbols and
hence is cumbersome at times. A new notation system has been proposed which uses
symbols and offers instantaneous comprehension like staff notation system. It is with
standardization of a notation system that hitherto unknown compositions would see the
light of day.

INSTRUMENTS
Instruments typically used in Hindustani music include sitar, sarood,tanpura, bansuri,
shehnai, sarangi, and table. Instruments typically used in carnatic music include flute,
gottuvadyam, veena mridangam, kanjira, ghatam and violon
