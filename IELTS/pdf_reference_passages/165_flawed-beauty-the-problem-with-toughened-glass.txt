Flawed Beauty: the problem with toughened glass

On 2nd August 1999, a particularly hot day in the town of Cirencester in the UK, a large
pane of toughened glass in the roof of a shopping centre at Bishops Walk shattered without
warning and fell from its frame.

When fragments were analysed by experts at the giant glass manufacturer Pilkington.
which had made the pane, they found that minute crystals of nickel sulphide trapped inside
the glass had almost certainly caused the failure.

'The glass industry is aware of the issue,' says Brian Waldron, chairman of the standards
committee at tine Glass and Glazing Federation, a British trade association, and standards
development officer at Pilkington. But he insists that cases are few and far between. ‘It's a
very rare phenomenon.' he says.

Others disagree. 'On average I see about one or two buildings a month suffering from
nickel sulphide related failures,' says Barrie Josie, a consultant engineer involved in the

Bishops Walk investigation. Other experts tell of similar experiences. Tony Wilmott of
London based consulting engineers Sandberg, and Simon Armstrong at CladTech
Associates in Hampshire both say they know of hundreds of cases. 'What you hear is only
the tip of the iceberg.' says Trevor Ford, a glass expert at Resolve Engineering in Brisbane.
Queensland. He believes the reason is simple: 'No-one wants bad press.'

Toughened glass is found everywhere, from cars and bus shelters to the windows, walls
and roofs of thousands of buildings around the world. It's easy to see why. This glass has
five times the strength of standard glass, and when it does break it shatters into tiny cubes
rather than large, razor-sharp shards. Architects love it because large panels can be bolted
together to make transparent walls, and turning it into ceilings and floors is almost as easy.

It is made by heating a sheet of ordinary glass to about 620°C to soften it slightly, allowing
its structure to expand, and then cooling it rapidly with jets of cold air. This causes the outer
layer of the pane to contract and solidify before the interior. When the interior finally
solidifies and shrinks, it exerts a pull on the outer layer that leaves It in permanent
compression and produces a tensile force inside the glass. As cracks propagate best in
materials under tension, the compressive force on the surface must be overcome before
the pane will break, making it more resistant to cracking.

The problem starts when glass contains nickel sulphide impurities. Trace amounts of nickel
and sulphur are usually present in the raw materials used to make glass, and nickel can
also be introduced by fragments of nickel alloys falling into the molten glass. As the glass is
heated, these atoms react to form tiny crystals of nickel sulphide. Just a tenth of a gram of
nickel in the furnace can create up to 50,000 crystals.

These crystals can exist in two forms: a dense form called the alpha phase, which is stable
at high temperatures, and a less dense form called the beta phase, which is stable at room
temperatures. The high temperatures used in the toughening process convert all the
crystals to the dense, compact alpha form. But the subsequent cooling is so rapid that the
crystals don't have time to change back to the beta phase. This leaves unstable alpha
crystals in the glass, primed like a coiled spring, ready to revert to the beta phase without
warning.
When this happens, the crystals expand by up to 4%. And if they are within the central,
tensile region of the pane, the stresses this unleashes can shatter the whole sheet. The
time that elapses before failure occurs is unpredictable. It could happen just months after
manufacture, or decades later, although if the glass is heated - by sunlight, for example -
the process is speeded up. Ironically, says Graham Dodd, of consulting engineers Arup in

London, the oldest pane of toughened glass known to have failed due to nickel sulphide
inclusions was in Pilkington's glass research building in Lathom, Lancashire. The pane was
27 years old.

Data showing the scale of the nickel sulphide problem Is almost Impossible to find. The
picture is made more complicated by the fact that these crystals occur in batches. So even
if, on average, there is only one inclusion in 7 tonnes of glass, if you experience one nickel
sulphide failure in your building, that probably means you've got a problem in more than
one pane. Josie says that in the last decade he has worked on over 15 buildings with the
number of failures into double figures.

One of the worst examples of this is Waterfront Place, which was completed in 1990. Over
the following decade the 40- storey Brisbane block suffered a rash of failures. Eighty panes
of its toughened glass shattered due to inclusions before experts were finally called in.
John Barry, an expert in nickel sulphide contamination at the University of Queensland,
analysed every glass pane in the building. Using a studio camera, a photographer went up
in a cradle to take photos of every pane. These were scanned under a modified microfiche
reader for signs of nickel sulphide crystals. ‘We discovered at least another 120 panes with
potentially dangerous inclusions which were then replaced,’ says Barry. ‘It was a very
expensive and time consuming process that took around six months to complete.'

Though the project cost A$1.6 million (nearly £700,000), the alternative - re-cladding the
entire building - would have cost ten times as much.
