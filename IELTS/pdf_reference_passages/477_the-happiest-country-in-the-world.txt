The happiest country in the world

Children growing up in Costa Rica are surrounded by some of the most beautiful and
diverse landscapes in the world. Preserving tropical rainforests isn’t Costa Rica’s only
success, because the government also makes sure everyone has access to health-care
and education. So when the New Economics Foundation released its second Happy Planet
Index, Costa Rica came out number one. The index is a ranking of countries based on their
impact on the environment and the health and happiness of their citizens.

According to Mariano Rojas, a Costa Rican economics professor, Costa Rica is a mid-
income country where citizens have plenty of time for themselves and for their relationships
with others. ‘A mid-income level allows most citizens to satisfy their basic needs. The
government makes sure that all Costa Ricans have access to education, health and
nutrition services.’ Costa Ricans, he believes, are not interested in status or spending
money to show how successful they are.

Created in 2008, the Happy Planet Index examines happiness on a national level and
ranks 143 countries according to three measurements: their citizens’ happiness, how long
they live (which reflects their health), and how much of the planet’s resources each country
consumes. According to researcher Saamah Abdallah, the Index also measures the
outcomes that are most important, and those are happy, healthy lives for everyone.
