Neanderthals and modern humans

A The evolutionary processes that have made modern humans so different from
other animals are hard to determine without an ability to examine human species
that have not achieved similar things. However, in a scientific masterpiece, Svante
Paabo and his colleagues from the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary
Anthropology, in Leipzig, have made such a comparison possible. In 2009, at a
meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, they made
public an analysis of the genome [1] of Neanderthal man.
B Homo neanderthalensis, to give its proper name, lived in Europe and parts of Asia from

400,000 years ago to 30,000 years ago. Towards the end of this period it shared its range
with interlopers in the form of Homo sapiens [2], who were spreading out from Africa.
However, the two species did not settle down to a stable cohabitation. For reasons which
are as yet unknown, the arrival of Homo sapiens in a region was always quickly followed by
the disappearance of Neanderthals.

C Before 2009, Dr Paabo and his team had conducted only a superficial comparison
between the DNA of Neanderthals and modern humans. Since then, they have
performed a more thorough study and, in doing so, have shed a fascinating light on the
intertwined history of the two species. That history turns out to be more intertwined than
many had previously believed.

D Dr Paabo and his colleagues compared their Neanderthal genome (painstakingly
reconstructed from three bone samples collected from a cave in Croatia) with that of
five living humans from various parts of Africa and Eurasia. Previous genetic
analysis, which had only examined DNA passed from mother to child in cellular
structures called mitochondria, had suggested no interbreeding between
Neanderthals and modern humans. The new, more extensive examination, which
looks at DNA in the cell nucleus rather than in the mitochondria, shows this
conclusion is wrong. By comparing the DNA in the cell nucleus of Africans (whose
ancestors could not have crossbred with Neanderthals, since they did not overlap
with them) and various Eurasians (whose ancestors could have crossbred with
Neanderthals), Dr Paabo has shown that Eurasians are between one percent and
four percent Neanderthal.

E That is intriguing. It shows that even after several hundred thousand years of
separation, the two species were inter-fertile. It is strange, though, that no
Neanderthal mitochondrial DNA has turned up in modern humans, since the usual
pattern of invasion in historical times was for the invaders’ males to mate with the
invaded’s females. One piece of self-knowledge, then - at least for non-Africans - is
that they have a dash of Neanderthal in them. But Dr Paabo’s work also illuminates
the differences between the species. By comparing modem humans, Neanderthals,
and chimpanzees, it is possible to distinguish genetic changes which are shared by
several species of human in their evolution away from the great-ape lineage, from
those which are unique to Homo sapiens.

F More than 90 percent of the ‘human accelerated regions’ [3] that have been identified
in modem people are found in Neanderthals too. However, the rest are not. Dr Paabo has
identified 212 parts of the genome that seem to have undergone significant evolution since
the species split. The state of genome science is still quite primitive, and it is often unclear
what any given bit of DNA is actually doing. But an examination of the 20 largest regions of
DNA that have evolved in this way shows that they include several genes which are
associated with cognitive ability, and whose malfunction causes serious mental problems.
These genes therefore look like good places to start the search for modern humanity’s
essence.
G The newly evolved regions of DNA also include a gene called RUNX2, which
controls bone growth. That may account for differences in the shape of the skull and
the rib cage between the two species. By contrast an earlier phase of the study had
already shown that Neanderthals and moderns share the same version of a gene
called FOXP2, which is involved in the ability to speak, and which differs in
chimpanzees. It is all, then, very promising - and a second coup in quick succession
for Dr Paabo. Another of his teams has revealed the existence of a hitherto
unsuspected species of human, using mitochondrial DNA found in a little-finger
bone. If that species, too, could have its full genome read, humanity’s ability to know
itself would be enhanced even further.
