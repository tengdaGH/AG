Children’s literature studies today

Who studies children’s literature and what is it that they study? The answers to this
question are complex and messy, because of the many confounding factors which exist in
this field.


Firstly, unlike literature for adults. Children’s literature is not generally written by its own
readers. Adults write for children, and thus adult perceptions of what children are and of
what they could and should be become woven into the literature.


Furthermore, some of those who study children’s literature (and those who write certain
kinds of children’s books) are less interested in literary values than in the kinds of lessons it
can teach- either in terms of creating better children or in terms of serving a particular
curriculum. The issue of how a teacher can use a children’s book is often contentious, but
even outside the classroom, much material for children is still didactic.


Thirdly, while almost all literature is currently promoted within a strong commercial matrix,
children’s literature is often especially targeted for marketing initiatives. This fact means
that readers are often recruited with a message that is negligibly literary and significantly
oriented to ideas of consumption. Daniel Hade (2002) has raised useful questions about
whether children’s experience of reading is altered when their books are part of a larger
marketing framework involving the movie, the game, and the toy of a popular children’s
book. How children perceive and respond to their stories in this new context is an important
question.


It is also important to note that texts in an ever-increasing range of new media compete
with print media for the attention of the child reader, and create definitional issues for
scholars. Does the term literature’ exclusively imply a verbal text? If not, where are the
limits? Could a literary computer game ever be considered a work of literature? If not, what
kind of attention should be paid to it, since children themselves undoubtedly perceive their
print literature as part of a broader continuum? The internet provides one forum through
which children now communicate with each other. (In 2003, the internet search engine
Google listed 7,920,000 sites relating to the Harry Potter novels; even allowing for
duplication and dead ends, that is a number with revolutionary implications.)


Finally, in the context of the higher education institutions where the formal study of
children’s literature of often located, at least three disciplinary frameworks (English,
education, and librarianship) fragment the focus of scholarly study of children’s literature.


How is the value of the imaginative encounter with the work of literature sustained and
honored among such a welter of conflicting interests? One route through this maze is to
ask the child readers for help. As David Lewis (2001) has perceptively noted, what children
think of reading is not usually the same as what adults think, whether teachers or parents.
As Lewis points out children ‘sometimes see more and they often see differently’. If those
who study reading can explore children’s perceptions as well as those of adults, their
understanding of the nature of reading will be enhanced.


Lewis makes a further valid point when he adds that exploring children’s perceptions is
usually justified for educational reasons: “It is true that a better understanding of how
children read and how they learn to read, is a prerequisite to improved approaches to
teaching. However, it can also be argued, as Lewis rightly does, that when children’s
responses to literature are accessed and interpreted, they frequently lead to an
understanding of how picture books appeal to children.


Young people’s accounts of what and how they read also enable a more sophisticated
description of many of the complex processes involved in reading. All descriptions of
reading run the risk of solipsism: i.e. this is how I read so this is what reading is for
everyone. Asking other readers how they read, however, reduces that risk. For example, if I
am a strong visualizer as I read, I may consider that visualization is a key component of
successful reading and I may judge books by their capacity to evoke a vivid visual
response. Other readers, however, may help me to realize that not everyone reads with
mental pictures. Some readers respond to the patterns of the words, ‘hearing’ them
inaudibly like a subliminal radio program. Others respond to the patterns of feelings in the
story, responding with an emotional connection. Talking to competent readers, of all ages,
provides a better understanding of reading experiences.


Children’s insights are even more important when it comes to understanding the
significance of print literature as one aspect of literary culture. Too often adults assume that
reading any book at all is a more worthwhile experience than playing a digital game of any
kind. A humbler approach would include asking why the game appeals to the player. Many
adults will probably never develop the automatic skills to precess a game as readily as they
can read a book. This does not indicate that a book is better, but that a particular set of
skills is absent Non-players must acknowledge that some fictional universes are thus
closed to them, and a logical response would be to find someone who can guide them to
the pleasures and challenges of the gaming world. Games need to be judged individually
just as books do, and any evaluative framework needs to take this into account.
