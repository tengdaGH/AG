Sleep helps reduce errors in memory

Sleep may reduce mistakes in memory, according to a first-of-its-kind study led by a
scientist at Michigan State University.

The findings, which appear in the September issue of the journal Learning El Memory,
have practical implications for many people, from students doing multiple-choice tests to
elderly people confusing their medicine, says Kimberly Fenn, principal investigator and
assistant professor of psychology.

‘It’s easy to muddle things in your mind,’ Fenn says. This research suggests that after
sleep, you’re better able to pick out the incorrect parts of that memory.’ Fenn and
colleagues from the University of Chicago and Washington University in St Louis studied
the presence of incorrect or false memory in groups of college students. While previous
research has shown that sleep improves memory, this study is the first one that looks at
errors in memory, she said.

Study participants were ‘trained’ by being shown or listening to lists of words. Then, twelve
hours later, they were shown individual words and asked to identify which words they had
seen or heard in the earlier session. One group of students was trained at 10 a.m. and
tested at 10 p.m. after the course of a normal sleepless day. Another group was trained at
night and tested twelve hours later in the morning, after about six hours of sleep. Three
experiments were conducted. In each experiment, the results showed that students who
had slept did not have as many problems with false memory and chose fewer incorrect
words.

How does sleep help? The answer isn’t known, Fenn said, but she suspects it may be due
to sleep strengthening the source of the memory. The source, or context in which the
information is acquired, is a vital element of the memory process.

In other words, it may be easier to remember something if you can also remember where
you first heard or saw it. Or perhaps the people who didn’t sleep as much during the study
received so much other information during the day that this affected their memory ability,

Fenn said.
Further research is needed, she said, adding that she plans to study different population
groups, particularly the elderly. ‘We know older individuals generally have worse memory
performance than younger individuals.

We also know from other research that elderly individuals tend to be more prone to false
memories,’ Fenn said. ‘Given the work we’ve done, it’s possible that sleep may actually
help them to reject this false information. And potentially this could help to improve their
quality of life.’
