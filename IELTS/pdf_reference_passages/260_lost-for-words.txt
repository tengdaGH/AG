Lost for words

In the Native American Navajo nation, which sprawls across four states in the American
south-west, the native language is dying. Most of its speakers are middle-aged or elderly
Although many students take classes in Navajo, the schools are run in English. Street
signs, supermarket goods and even their own newspaper are all in English. Not
surprisingly, linguists doubt that any native speakers of Navajo will remain in a hundred
years’ time.

Navajo is far from alone. Half the world’s 6,800 languages are likely to vanish within two
generations - that’s one language lost every ten days. Never before has the planet’s
linguistic diversity shrunk at such a pace. At the moment, we are heading for about three or
four languages dominating the world,’ says Mark Pagel, an evolutionary biologist at the
University of Reading. ‘It’s a mass extinction, and whether we will ever rebound from the
loss is difficult to know.’

Isolation breeds linguistic diversity: as a result, the world is peppered with languages
spoken by only a few people. Only 250 languages have more than a million speakers, and
at least 3,000 have fewer than 2,500. It is not necessarily these small languages that are
about to disappear. Navajo is considered endangered despite having 150,000 speakers.
What makes a language endangered is not just the number of speakers, but how old they
are. If it is spoken by children it is relatively safe. The critically endangered languages are
those that are only spoken by the elderly, according to Michael Krauss, director of the

Alassk Native Language Center, in Fairbanks.
Why do people reject the language of their parents? It begins with a crisis of confidence,
when a small community finds itself alongside a larger, wealthier society, says Nicholas
Ostler, of Britain’s Foundation for Endangered Languages, in Bath. ‘People lose faith in
their culture,’ he says. ‘When the next generation reaches their teens, they might not want
to be induced into the old traditions.’

The change is not always voluntary. Quite often, governments try to kill off a minority
language by banning its use in public or discouraging its use in schools, all to promote
national unity.

The former US policy of running Indian reservation schools in English, for example,
effectively put languages such as Navajo on the danger list. But Salikoko Mufwene, who
chairs the Linguistics department at the University of Chicago, argues that the deadliest
weapon is not government policy but economic globalisation. ‘Native Americans have not
lost pride in their language, but they have had to adapt to socio-economic pressures,’ he
says. ‘They cannot refuse to speak English if most commercial activity is in English.’ But
are languages worth saving? At the very least, there is a loss of data for the study of
languages and their evolution, which relies on comparisons between languages, both living
and dead. When an unwritten and unrecorded language disappears, it is lost to science.

Language is also intimately bound up with culture, so it may be difficult to preserve one
without the other. ‘If a person shifts from Navajo to English, they lose something,’ Mufwene
says. ‘Moreover, the loss of diversity may also deprive us of different ways of looking at the
world,’ says Pagel. There is mounting evidence that learning a language produces
physiological changes in the brain. ‘Your brain and mine are different from the brain of
someone who speaks French, for instance,’ Pagel says, and this could affect our thoughts
and perceptions. ‘The patterns and connections we make among various concepts may be
structured by the linguistic habits of our community.’

So despite linguists’ best efforts, many languages will disappear over the next century. But
a growing interest in cultural identity may prevent the direst predictions from coming true.
‘The key to fostering diversity is for people to learn their ancestral tongue, as well as the
dominant language,’ says Doug Whalen, founder and president of the Endangered

Language Fund in New Haven, Connecticut. ‘Most of these languages will not survive
without a large degree of bilingualism,’ he says. In New Zealand, classes for children have
slowed the erosion of Maori and rekindled interest in the language. A similar approach in
Hawaii has produced about 8,000 new speakers of Polynesian languages in the past few
years. In California, ‘apprentice’ programmes have provided life support to several
indigenous languages. Volunteer ‘apprentices’ pair up with one of the last living speakers of
a Native American tongue to learn a traditional skill such as basket weaving, with
instruction exclusively in the endangered language. After about 300 hours of training they
are generally sufficiently fluent to transmit the language to the next generation. But

Mufwene says that preventing a language dying out is not the same as giving it new life by
using it every day. ‘Preserving a language is more like preserving fruits in a jar,’ he says.
However, preservation can bring a language back from the dead. There are examples of
languages that have survived in written form and then been revived by later generations.
But a written form is essential for this, so the mere possibility of revival has led many
speakers of endangered languages to develop systems of writing where none existed
before.
