Legal information on call


What is Dial-A-Law?

Dial-A-Law is a library of pre-recorded messages to provide general information on
specific topics of law. You can call this service 24 hours a day, 7 days a week and listen
to any tape from our complete library of pre-recorded messages.
Dial-A-Law provides information, not legal advice. Each legal problem is different so if
you have a legal problem you should talk to a solicitor. If you don't have a solicitor, the

Legal Referral Service can refer you to a solicitor in your area.
While the Dial-A-Law information service is available 24 hours a day, the Legal Referral
Service is open only during normal business hours.

What if I need a solicitor?

If you listen to a Dial-A-Law message after business hours, you can phone the Legal
Referral Service during business hours the following day on the number given to you at
the end of the message.
If you listen to a Dial-A-Law message during business hours and decide you want a
referral to a solicitor, press the appropriate number when prompted and you will be
automatically transferred to the Legal Referral Service.
You will be given the names of up to three solicitors in your suburb who practise in the
specific area of law you require. You can simply arrange an appointment with one of
these solicitors. Then you must contact the Legal Referral Service to obtain a referral
letter. You must hand this to the solicitor at the beginning of your interview He or she will
give you an initial interview of up to 30 minutes free of charge.

During the interview the solicitor will tell you if you have a legal case, what is involved,
approximately how long it should take to solve the problem, and how much it is likely to
cost. Then, if you and the solicitor agree, you may hire the solicitor to handle your
problem at his or her normal fee.
