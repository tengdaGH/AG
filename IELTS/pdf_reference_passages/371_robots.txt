ROBOTS

Since the dawn of human ingenuity, people have devised ever more cunning tools to
cope with work that is dangerous, boring, onerous, or just plain nasty. That
compulsion has culminated in robotics - the science of conferring various human
capabilities on machines.

A The modern world is increasingly populated by quasi-intelligent gizmos whose
presence we barely notice but whose creeping ubiquity has removed much human
drudgery. Our factories hum to the rhythm of robot assembly arms. Our banking is done at
automated teller terminals that thank us with rote politeness for the transaction. Our
subway trains are controlled by tireless robo- drivers. Our mine shafts are dug by
automated moles, and our nuclear accidents - such as those at Three Mile Island and
Chernobyl - are cleaned up by robotic muckers fit to withstand radiation.

Such is the scope of uses envisioned by Karel Capek, the Czech playwright who coined the
term ‘robot’ in 1920 (the word ‘robota’ means ‘forced labor’ in Czech). As progress
accelerates, the experimental becomes the exploitable at record pace.

B Other innovations promise to extend the abilities of human operators. Thanks to
the incessant miniaturisation of electronics and micromechanics, there are already
robot systems that can perform some kinds of brain and bone surgery with
submillimeter accuracy - far greater precision than highly skilled physicians can
achieve with their hands alone. At the same time, techniques of long-distance
control will keep people even farther from hazard. In 1994 a ten- foot-tall NASA
robotic explorer called Dante, with video-camera eyes and with spiderlike legs,
scrambled over the menacing rim of an Alaskan volcano while technicians 2,000
miles away in California watched the scene by satellite and controlled Dante’s
descent.

C But if robots are to reach the next stage of labour-saving utility, they will have to
operate with less human supervision and be able to make at least a few decisions for
themselves - goals that pose a formidable challenge. ‘While we know how to tell a
robot to handle a specific error,’ says one expert, ‘we can’t yet give a robot enough
common sense to reliably interact with a dynamic world.’ Indeed the quest for true
artificial intelligence (Al) has produced very mixed results. Despite a spasm of initial
optimism in the 1960s and 1970s, when it appeared that transistor circuits and
microprocessors might be able to perform in the same way as the human brain by
the 21st century, researchers lately have extended their forecasts by decades if not
centuries.
D What they found, in attempting to model thought, is that the human brain’s roughly one
hundred billion neurons are much more talented - and human perception far more
complicated - than previously imagined. They have built robots that can recognise the
misalignment of a machine panel by a fraction of a millimeter in a controlled factory
environment. But the human mind can glimpse a rapidly changing scene and immediately
disregard the 98 per cent that is irrelevant, instantaneously focusing on the woodchuck at
the side of a winding forest road or the single suspicious face in a tumultuous crowd. The
most advanced computer systems on Earth can’t approach that kind of ability, and
neuroscientists still don’t know quite how we do it.
E Nonetheless, as information theorists, neuroscientists, and computer experts pool their
talents, they are finding ways to get some lifelike intelligence from robots. One method
renounces the linear, logical structure of conventional electronic circuits in favour of the
messy, ad hoc arrangement of a real brain’s neurons. These ‘neural networks’ do not have
to be programmed. They can ‘teach’ themselves by a system of feedback signals that
reinforce electrical pathways that produced correct responses and, conversely, wipe out
connections that produced errors. Eventually the net wires itself into a system that can
pronounce certain words or distinguish certain shapes.

F In other areas researchers are struggling to fashion a more natural relationship between
people and robots in the expectation that some day machines will take on some tasks now
done by humans in, say, nursing homes. This is particularly important in Japan, where the
percentage of elderly citizens is rapidly increasing. So experiments at the Science
University of Tokyo have created a ‘face robot’ - a life-size, soft plastic model of a female
head with a video camera imbedded in the left eye - as a prototype. The researchers’ goal
is to create robots that people feel comfortable around. They are concentrating on the face
because they believe facial expressions are the most important way to transfer emotional
messages. We read those messages by interpreting expressions to decide whether a
person is happy, frightened, angry, or nervous. Thus the Japanese robot is designed to
detect emotions in the person it is ‘looking at’ by sensing changes in the spatial
arrangement of the person’s eyes, nose, eyebrows, and mouth. It compares those
configurations with a database of standard facial expressions and guesses the emotion.
The robot then uses an ensemble of tiny pressure pads to adjust its plastic face into an
appropriate emotional response.

G Other labs are taking a different approach, one that doesn’t try to mimic human
intelligence or emotions. Just as computer design has moved away from one central
mainframe in favour of myriad individual workstations - and single processors have been
replaced by arrays of smaller units that break a big problem into parts that are solved
simultaneously - many experts are now investigating whether swarms of semi-smart robots
can generate a collective intelligence that is greater than the sum of its parts. That’s what
beehives and ant colonies do, and several teams are betting that legions of mini-critters
working together like an ant colony could be sent to explore the climate of planets or to
inspect pipes in dangerous industrial situations.
