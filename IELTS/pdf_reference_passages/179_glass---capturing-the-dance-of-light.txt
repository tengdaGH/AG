GLASS - Capturing the dance of light

A Glass, in one form or another, has long been in noble service to humans. As one of the
most widely used of manufactured materials, and certainly the most versatile, it can be as
imposing as a telescope mirror the width of a tennis court or as small and simple as a
marble rolling across dirt. The uses of this adaptable material have been broadened
dramatically by new technologies glass fibre optics — more than eight million miles —
carrying telephone and television signals across nations, glass ceramics serving as the
nose cones of missiles and as crowns for teeth; tiny glass beads taking radiation doses
inside the body to specific organs, even a new type of glass fashioned of nuclear waste in
order to dispose of that unwanted material.

B On the horizon are optical computers. These could store programs and process
information by means of light - pulses from tiny lasers - rather than electrons. And the
pulses would travel over glass fibres, not copper wire. These machines could function
hundreds of times faster than today’s electronic computers and hold vastly more
information. Today fibre optics are used to obtain a clearer image of smaller and smaller
objects than ever before - even bacterial viruses. A new generation of optical instruments is
emerging that can provide detailed imaging of the inner workings of cells. It is the surge in
fibre optic use and in liquid crystal displays that has set the U.S. glass industry (a 16 billion
dollar business employing some 150,000 workers) to building new plants to meet demand.
C But it is not only in technology and commerce that glass has widened its horizons. The
use of glass as art, a tradition spins back at least to Roman times, is also booming. Nearly
everywhere, it seems, men and women are blowing glass and creating works of art. «I
didn’t sell a piece of glass until 1975,» Dale Chihuly said, smiling, for in the 18 years since
the end of the dry spell, he has become one of the most financially successful artists of the
20th century. He now has a new commission - a glass sculpture for the headquarters
building of a pizza company - for which his fee is half a million dollars.

D But not all the glass technology that touches our lives is ultra-modern. Consider the
simple light bulb; at the turn of the century most light bulbs were hand blown, and the cost
of one was equivalent to half a day’s pay for the average worker. In effect, the invention of
the ribbon machine by Corning in the 1920s lighted a nation. The price of a bulb plunged.
Small wonder that the machine has been called one of the great mechanical achievements
of all time. Yet it is very simple: a narrow ribbon of molten glass travels over a moving belt
of steel in which there are holes. The glass sags through the holes and into waiting moulds.
Puffs of compressed air then shape the glass. In this way, the envelope of a light bulb is
made by a single machine at the rate of 66,000 an hour, as compared with 1,200 a day
produced by a team of four glassblowers.

E The secret of the versatility of glass lies in its interior structure. Although it is rigid, and
thus like a solid, the atoms are arranged in a random disordered fashion, characteristic of a
liquid. In the melting process, the atoms in the raw materials are disturbed from their
normal position in the molecular structure; before they can find their way back to crystalline
arrangements the glass cools. This looseness in molecular structure gives the material
what engineers call tremendous “formability” which allows technicians to tailor glass to
whatever they need.

F Today, scientists continue to experiment with new glass mixtures and building designers
test their imaginations with applications of special types of glass. A London architect, Mike
Davies, sees even more dramatic buildings using molecular chemistry. “Glass is the great
building material of the future, the «dynamic skin»,’ he said. “Think of glass that has been
treated to react to electric currents going through it, glass that will change from clear to
opaque at the push of a button, that gives you instant curtains. Think of how the tall
buildings in New York could perform a symphony of colours as the glass in them is made to
change colours instantly.” Glass as instant curtains is available now, but the cost is
exorbitant. As for the glass changing colours instantly, that may come true. Mike Davies’s
vision may indeed be on the way to fulfilment.
