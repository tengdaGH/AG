Food for thought 2

A


There are not enough classrooms at the Msekeni primary school, so half the lessons take
place in the shade of yellow-blossomed acacia trees. Given this shortage, it might seem
odd that one of the school’s purpose-built classrooms has been emptied of pupils and
turned into a storeroom for sacks of grain. But it makes sense. Food matters more than
shelter.
B

Msekeni is in one of the poorer parts of Malawi, a landlocked southern African country of
exceptional beauty and great poverty. No war lays waste Malawi, nor is the land unusually
crowed or infertile, but Malawians still have trouble finding enough to eat. Half of the
children under five are underfed to the point of stunting. Hunger blights most aspects of
Malawian life, so the country is as good a place as any to investigate how nutrition affects
development, and vice versa.

C

The headmaster at Msekeni, Bernard Kumanda, has strong views on the subject. He thinks
food is a priceless teaching aid. Since 1999, his pupils have received free school lunches.
Donors such as the World Food Programme (WFP) provide the food: those sacks of grain
(mostly mixed maize and soya bean flour, enriched with vitamin A) in that converted
classroom. Local volunteers do the cooking – turning the dry ingredients into a bland but
nutritious slop and spooning it out on to plastic plates. The children line up in large crowds,
cheerfully singing a song called “We are getting porridge”.

D

When the school’s feeding programme was introduced, enrolment at Msekeni doubled.
Some of the new pupils had switched from nearby schools that did not give out free
porridge, but most were children whose families had previously kept them at home to work.
These families were so poor that the long-term benefits of education seemed unattractive
when setting against the short-term gain of sending children out to gather firewood or help
in the fields. One plate of porridge a day completely altered the calculation. A child fed at
school will not howl so plaintively for food at home. Girls, who are more likely than boys to
be kept out of school, are given extra snacks to take home.

E
When a school takes in a horde of extra students from the poorest homes, you would
expect standards to drop. Anywhere in the world, poor kids tend to perform worse than
their better-off classmates. When the influx of new pupils is not accompanied by an
increase in the number of teachers, as was the case at Msekeni, you would expect
standards to fall even further. But they have not. Pass rates at Msekeni improved
dramatically, from 30% to 85%. Although this was an exceptional example, the nationwide
results of school feeding programmes were still pretty good. On average, after a Malawian
school started handing out free food it attracted 38% more girls and 24% more boys. The
pass rate for boys stayed about the same, while for girls it improved by 9.5%.

F

Better nutrition makes for brighter children. Most immediately, well-fed children find it easier
to concentrate. It is hard to focus the mind on long division when your stomach is
screaming for food. Mr Kumanda says that it used to be easy to spot the kids who were
really undernourished. “They were the ones who stared into space and didn’t respond
when you asked the question,” he says. More crucially, though, more and better food helps
brains grow and develop. Like any other organ in the body, the brain needs nutrition and
exercise. But if it is starved of the necessary calories, proteins and micronutrients, it is
stunted, perhaps not as severely as a muscle would be, but stunted nonetheless. That is
why feeding children at schools work so well. And the fact that the effect of feeding was
more pronounced in girls than in boys gives a clue to who eats first in rural Malawian
households. It isn’t the girls.

G

On a global scale, the good news is that people are eating better than ever before. Homo
sapiens has grown 50% bigger since the industrial revolution. Three centuries ago, chronic
malnutrition was more or less universal. Now, it is extremely rare in rich countries. In
developing countries, where most people live, plates and rice bowls are also fuller than
ever before. The proportion of children under five in the developing world who are
malnourished to the point of stunting fell from 39% in 1990 to 30% in 2000, says the World
Health Organisation (WHO). In other places, the battle against hunger is steadily being
won. Better nutrition is making people cleverer and more energetic, which will help them
grow more prosperous. And when they eventually join the ranks of the well off, they can
start fretting about growing too fast.
