A request for help in improving the availability of transport within\nthe remote Makete District of southwestern Tanzania presented the opportunity to try a\nnew approach.\nThe concept of 'integrated rural transport' was adopted in the task of examining the\ntransport needs of the rural households in the district. The objective was to reduce the time\nand effort needed to obtain access to essential goods and services through an improved\nrural transport system. The underlying assumption was that the time saved would be used\ninstead for activities that would improve the social and economic development of the\ncommunities. The Makete Integrated Rural Transport Project (MIRTP) started in 1985 with\nfinancial support from the Swiss Development Corporation and was co-ordinated with the\nhelp of the Tanzanian government.\nSection B\nWhen the project began, Makete District was virtually totally isolated during the rainy\nseason.The regional road was in such bad shape that access to the main towns was\nimpossible for about three months of the year Road traffic was extremely rare within the\ndistrict, and alternative means of transport were restricted to donkeys in the north of the\ndistrict. People relied primarily on the paths, which were slippery and dangerous during the\nrains.\nBefore solutions could be proposed, the problems had to be understood. Little was known\nabout the transport demands of the rural households, so Phase I, between December 1985\nand December 1987, focused on research.The socio-economic survey of more than 400\nhouseholds in the district indicated that a household in Makete spent, on average, seven\nhours a day on transporting themselves and their goods, a figure which seemed extreme\nbut which has also been obtained in surveys in other rural areas in Africa. Interesting facts\nregarding transport were found: 95% was on foot; 80% was within the locality; and\n70% was related to the collection of water and firewood and travelling to grinding mills. \nSection C\nHaving determined the main transport needs, possible solutions were identified which\nmight reduce the time and burden. During Phase II, from January to February 1991, a\nnumber of approaches were implemented in an effort to improve mobility and access to\ntransport.\nAn improvement of the road network was considered necessary to ensure the import and\nexport of goods to the district.These improvements were carried out using methods that\nwere heavily dependent on labour In addition to the improvement of roads, these methods\nprovided training in the operation of a mechanical workshop and bus and truck services.\nHowever the difference from the conventional approach was that this time consideration\nwas given to local transport needs outside the road network.\n \n1\n\nMost goods were transported along the paths that provide short-cuts up and down the\nhillsides, but the paths were a real safety risk and made the journey on foot even more\narduous. It made sense to improve the paths by building steps, handrails and footbridges.\nIt was uncommon to find means of transport that were more efficient than walking but less\ntechnologically advanced than motor vehicles. The use of bicycles was constrained by their\nhigh cost and the lack of available spare parts. Oxen were not used at all but donkeys were\nused by a few households in the northern part of the district. MIRTP focused on what would\nbe most appropriate for the inhabitants of Makete in terms of what was available, how\nmuch they could afford and what they were willing to accept.\nAfter careful consideration, the project chose the promotion of donkeys - a donkey costs\nless than a bicycle - and the introduction of a locally manufacturable wheelbarrow.\nSection D\nAt the end of Phase II, it was clear that the selected approaches to Makete\u2019s transport\nproblems had had different degrees of success. Phase III, from March 1991 to March 1993,\nfocused on the refinement and institutionalisation of these activities.\nThe road improvements and accompanying maintenance system had helped make the\ndistrict centre accessible throughout the year. Essential goods from outside the district had\nbecome more readily available at the market, and prices did not fluctuate as much as they\nhad done before.\nPaths and secondary roads were improved only at the request of communities who were\nwilling to participate in construction and maintenance. However the improved paths\nimpressed the inhabitants, and requests for assistance greatly increased soon after only a\nfew improvements had been completed.\nThe efforts to improve the efficiency of the existing transport services were not very\nsuccessful because most of the motorised vehicles in the district broke down and there\nwere no resources to repair them. Even the introduction of low-cost means of transport was\ndifficult because of the general poverty of the district.The locally manufactured\nwheelbarrows were still too expensive for all but a few of the households. Modifications to\nthe original design by local carpenters cut production time and costs. Other\nlocal carpenters have been trained in the new design so that they can respond to requests.\nNevertheless, a locally produced wooden wheelbarrow which costs around 5000\nTanzanian shillings (less than US$20) in Makete, and is about one quarter the cost of a\nmetal wheelbarrow, is still too expensive for most people.\nDonkeys, which were imported to the district, have become more common and contribute,\nin particular, to the transportation of crops and goods to market. Those who have bought\ndonkeys are mainly from richer households but, with an increased supply through local\nbreeding, donkeys should become more affordable. Meanwhile, local initiatives are\npromoting the renting out of the existing donkeys.\nIt should be noted, however, that a donkey, which at 20,000 Tanzanian shillings costs less\nthan a bicycle, is still an investment equal to an average household's income over half a\nyear This clearly illustrates the need for supplementary measures if one wants to assist the\nrural poor\nSection E\n \n2\n\nIt would have been easy to criticise the MIRTP for using in the early phases a 'top-down'\napproach, in which decisions were made by experts and officials before being handed\ndown to communities, but it was necessary to start the process from the level of the\ngovernmental authorities of the district. It would have been difficult to respond to the\nrequests of villagers and other rural inhabitants without the support and understanding of\ndistrict authorities.\nSection F\nToday, nobody in the district argues about the importance of improved paths and\ninexpensive means of transport. But this is the result of dedicated work over a long period,\nparticularly from the officers in charge of community development. They played an\nessential role in raising awareness and interest among the rural communities.\nThe concept of integrated rural transport is now well established in Tanzania, where a\nmajor program of rural transport is just about to start.The experiences from Makete will help\nin this initiative, and Makete District will act as a reference for future work.\n \n3",
