    "passage_text": "Reading Practice\n \nWilliam Gilbert and Magnetism\nA\nThe 16th and 17th centuries saw two great pioneers of modern science: Galileo and\nGilbert. The impact of their findings is eminent. Gilbert was the first modern scientist, also\nthe accredited father of the science of electricity and magnetism, an Englishman of learning\nand a physician at the court of Elizabeth. Prior to him, all that was known of electricity and\nmagnetism was what the ancients knew, nothing more than that the lodestone possessed\nmagnetic properties and that amber and jet, when rubbed, would attract bits of paper or\nother substances of small specific gravity. However, he is less well known than he\ndeserves.\nB\nGilbert\u2019s birth pre-dated Galileo. Born in an eminent local family in Colchester County in the\nUK, on May 24, 1544, he went to grammar school, and then studied medicine at St John\u2019s\nCollege, Cambridge, graduating in 1573. Later he travelled in the continent and eventually\nsettled down in London.\nC\nHe was a very successful and eminent doctor. All this culminated in his election to the\npresident of the Royal Science Society. He was also appointed personal physician to the\nQueen (Elizabeth I), and later knighted by the Queen. He faithfully served her until her\ndeath. However, he didn\u2019t outlive the Queen for long and died on November 30, 1603, only\na few months after his appointment as personal physician to King James.\nD\nGilbert was first interested in chemistry but later changed his focus due to the large portion\nof mysticism of alchemy involved (such as the transmutation of metal). He gradually\ndeveloped his interest in physics after the great minds of the ancient, particularly about the\nknowledge the ancient Greeks had about lodestones, strange minerals with the power to\nattract iron. In the meantime, Britain became a major seafaring nation in 1588 when the\nSpanish Armada was defeated, opening the way to British settlement of America. British\nships depended on the magnetic compass, yet no one understood why it worked. Did the\nPole Star attract it, as Columbus once speculated; or was there a magnetic mountain at the\npole, as described in Odyssey, which ships would never approach, because the sailors\nthought its pull would yank out all their iron nails and fittings? For nearly 20 years, William\nGilbert conducted ingenious experiments to understand magnetism. His works include On\nthe Magnet, Magnetic Bodies, and the Great Magnet of the Earth.\nE\nGilbert\u2019s discovery was so important to modern physics. He investigated the nature of\nmagnetism and electricity. He even coined the word \u201celectric\u201d. Though the early beliefs of\nmagnetism were also largely entangled with superstitions such as that rubbing garlic on\nlodestone can neutralise its magnetism, one example being that sailors even believed the\nsmell of garlic would even interfere with the action of compass, which is why helmsmen\nwere forbidden to eat it near a ship\u2019s compass. Gilbert also found that metals can be\n \n1\n\nmagnetised by rubbing materials such as fur, plastic or the like on them. He named the\nends of a magnet \u201cnorth pole\u201d and \u201csouth pole\u201d. The magnetic poles can attract or repel,\ndepending on polarity. In addition, however, ordinary iron is always attracted to a magnet.\nThough he started to study the relationship between magnetism and electricity, sadly he\ndidn\u2019t complete it. His research of static electricity using amber and jet only demonstrated\nthat objects with electrical charges can work like magnets attracting small pieces of paper\nand stuff. It is a French guy named du Fay that discovered that there are actually two\nelectrical charges, positive and negative.\nF\nHe also questioned the traditional astronomical beliefs. Though a Copernican, he didn\u2019t\nexpress in his quintessential beliefs whether the earth is at the centre of the universe or in\norbit around the sun. However, he believed that stars are not equidistant from the earth but\nhave their own earth-like planets orbiting around them. The earth itself is like a giant\nmagnet, which is also why compasses always point north. They spin on an axis that is\naligned with the earth\u2019s polarity. He even likened the polarity of the magnet to the polarity of\nthe earth and built an entire magnetic philosophy on this analogy. In his explanation,\nmagnetism is the soul of the earth. Thus a perfectly spherical lodestone, when aligned with\nthe earth\u2019s poles, would wobble all by itself in 24 hours. Further, he also believed that the\nsun and other stars wobble just like the earth does around a crystal core, and speculated\nthat the moon might also be a magnet caused to orbit by its magnetic attraction to the\nearth. This was perhaps the first proposal that a force might cause a heavenly orbit.\nG\nHis research method was revolutionary in that he used experiments rather than pure logic\nand reasoning like the ancient Greek philosophers did. It was a new attitude towards\nscientific investigation. Until then, scientific experiments were not in fashion. It was\nbecause of this scientific attitude, together with his contribution to our knowledge of\nmagnetism, that a unit of magneto motive force, also known as magnetic potential, was\nnamed Gilbert in his honour. His approach of careful observation and experimentation\nrather than the authoritative opinion or deductive philosophy of others had laid the very\nfoundation for modern science.\n \n2",
