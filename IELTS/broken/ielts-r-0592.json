    "passage_text": "Reading Practice\n \n \nTrends and prospects for European transport systems\n \nA It is difficult to conceive of vigorous economic growth without an efficient transport\nsystem. Although modern information technologies can reduce the demand for physical\ntransport by facilitating teleworking and teleservices, the requirement for transport\ncontinues to increase. There are two key factors behind this trend. For passenger\ntransport, the determining factor is the spectacular growth in car use. The number of cars\non European Union (EU) roads saw an increase of three million cars each year from 1990\nto 2010, and in the next decade the EU will see a further substantial increase in its fleet.\n \nB As far as goods transport is concerned, growth is due to a large extent to changes in the\nEuropean economy and its system of production. In the last 20 years, as internal frontiers\nhave been abolished, the EU has moved from a \u201dstock\u201d economy to a \u201dflow\u201d economy. This\nphenomenon has been emphasised by the relocation of some industries, particularly those\nwhich are labour intensive, to reduce production costs, even though the production site is\nhundreds or even thousands of kilometres away from the final assembly plant or away from\nusers.\nC The strong economic growth expected in countries which are candidates for entry to the\nEU will also increase transport flows, in particular road haulage traffic. In 1998, some of\nthese countries already exported more than twice their 1990 volumes and imported more\nthan five times their 1990 volumes. And although many candidate countries inherited a\ntransport system which encourages rail, the distribution between modes has tipped sharply\nin favour of road transport since the 1990s. Between 1990 and 1998road haulage\nincreased by 19.4%, while during the same period rail haulage decreased by 43.5%,\nalthough \u2013 and this could benefit the enlarged EU \u2013 it is still on average at a much higher\nlevel than in existing member states.\n \nD However, a new imperative-sustainable development \u2013 offers an opportunity for adapting\nthe EUs common transport policy. This objective, agreed by the Gothenburg European\nCouncil, has to be achieved by integrating environmental considerations into Community\npolicies, and shifting the balance between modes of transport lies at the heart of its\nstrategy. The ambitious objective can only be fully achieved by 2020, but proposed\nmeasures are nonetheless a first essential step towards a sustainable transport system\nwhich will ideally be in place in 30 years time, that is by 2040.\n \nE In 1998, energy consumption in the transport sector was to blame for 28% of emissions\nof CO2the leading greenhouse gas. According to the latest estimates, if nothing is done to\nreverse the traffic growth trend, CO2 emissions from transport can be expected to increase\nby around 50% to 1,113 billion tonnes by 2020compared with the 739 billion tonnes\nrecorded in 1990. Once again, road transport is the main culprit since it alone accounts for\n84% of the CO2 emissions attributable to transport. Using alternative fuels and improving\nenergy efficiency is thus both an ecological necessity and a technological challenge.\nF At the same time greater efforts must be made to achieve a modal shift. Such a change\ncannot be achieved overnight, all the less so after over half a century of constant\ndeterioration in favour of road. This has reached such a pitch that today rail freight services\nare facing marginalisation, with just 8% of market share, and with international goods trains\nstruggling along at an average speed of 18km/h. Three possible options have emerged.\n \n1\n\n \n \nG The first approach would consist of focusing on road transport solely through pricing.\nThis option would not be accompanied by complementary measures in the other modes of\ntransport. In the short term it might curb the growth in road transport through the better\nloading ratio of goods vehicles and occupancy rates of passenger vehicles expected as a\nresult of the increase in the price of transport. However, the lack of measures available to\nrevitalise other modes of transport would make it impossible for more sustainable modes of\ntransport to take up the baton.\nH The second approach also concentrates on road transport pricing but is accompanied by\nmeasures to increase the efficiency of the other modes (better quality of services, logistics,\ntechnology). However, this approach does not include investment in new infrastructure, nor\ndoes it guarantee better regional cohesion. It could help to achieve greater uncoupling than\nthe first approach, but road transport would keep the lions share of the market and continue\nto concentrate on saturated arteries, despite being the most polluting of the modes. It is\ntherefore not enough to guarantee the necessary shift of the balance.\nI The third approach, which is not new, comprises a series of measures ranging from\npricing to revitalising alternative modes of transport and targeting investment in the trans-\nEuropean network. This integrated approach would allow the market shares of the other\nmodes to return to their 1998 levels and thus make a shift of balance. It is far more\nambitious than it looks, bearing in mind the historical imbalance in favour of roads for the\nlast fifty years, but would achieve a marked break in the link between road transport growth\nand economic growth, without placing restrictions on the mobility of people and goods.\n \n2",
