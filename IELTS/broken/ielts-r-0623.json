We understand a port as a centre of land-sea exchange, and as a\nmajor source of livelihood and a major force for cultural mixing. But do ports all produce a\nrange of common urban characteristics which justify classifying port cities together under a\nsingle generic label? Do they have enough in common to warrant distinguishing them from\nother kinds of cities?\nA\nA port must be distinguished from a harbour. They are two very different things. Most ports\nhave poor harbours, and many fine harbours see few ships. Harbour is a physical concept,\na shelter for ships; port is an economic concept, a centre of land-sea exchange which\nrequires good access to a hinterland even more than a sea-linked foreland. It is landward\naccess, which is productive of goods for export and which demands imports, that is critical.\nPoor harbours can be improved with breakwaters and dredging if there is a demand for a\nport. Madras and Colombo are examples of harbours expensively improved by enlarging,\ndredging and building breakwaters.\nB\nPort cities become industrial, financial and service centres and political capitals because of\ntheir water connections and the urban concentration which arises there and later draws to it\nrailways, highways and air routes. Water transport means cheap access, the chief basis of\nall port cities. Many of the world's biggest cities, for example, London, New York, Shanghai,\nIstanbul, Buenos Aires, Tokyo, Jakarta, Calcutta, Philadelphia and San Francisco began as\nports - that is, with land-sea exchange as their major function - but they have since grown\ndisproportionately in other respects so that their port functions are no longer dominant.\nThey remain different kinds of places from non-port cities and their port functions account\nfor that difference.\nC\nPort functions, more than anything else, make a city cosmopolitan. A port city is open to the\nworld. In it races, cultures, and ideas, as well as goods from a variety of places, jostle, mix\nand enrich each other and the life of the city. The smell of the sea and the harbour, the\nsound of boat whistles or the moving tides are symbols of their multiple links with a wide\nworld, samples of which are present in microcosm within their own urban areas.\nD\nSea ports have been transformed by the advent of powered vessels, whose size and\ndraught have increased. Many formerly important ports have become economically and\nphysically less accessible as a result. By-passed by most of their former enriching flow of\nexchange, they have become cultural and economic backwaters or have acquired the\ncharacter of museums of the past. Examples of these are Charleston, Salem, Bristol,\nPlymouth, Surat, Galle, Melaka, Soochow, and a long list of earlier prominent port cities in\nSoutheast Asia, Africa and Latin America.\nE\n \n1\n\nMuch domestic port trade has not been recorded. What evidence we have suggests that\ndomestic trade was greater at all periods than external trade. Shanghai, for example, did\nmost of its trade with other Chinese ports and inland cities. Calcutta traded mainly with\nother parts of India and so on. Most of any city's population is engaged in providing goods\nand services for the city itself. Trade outside the city is its basic function. But each basic\nworker requires food, housing, clothing and other such services. Estimates of the ratio of\nbasic to service workers range from 1:4 to 1:8.\nF\nNo city can be simply a port but must be involved in a variety of other activities. The port\nfunction of the city draws to it raw materials and distributes them in many other forms. Ports\ntake advantage of the need for breaking up the bulk material where water and land\ntransport meet and where loading and unloading costs can be minimised by refining raw\nmaterials or turning them into finished goods. The major examples here are oil refining and\nore refining, which are commonly located at ports. It is not easy to draw a line around what\nis and is not a port function.
