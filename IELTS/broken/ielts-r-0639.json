    "passage_text": "Reading Practice\n \nWhy Risks Can Go Wrong\nHuman intuition is a bad guide to handling risk\nA. People make terrible decisions about the future. The evidence is all around, from their\ninvestments in the stock markets to the way they run their businesses. In fact, people are\nconsistently bad at dealing with uncertainty, underestimating some kinds of risk and\noverestimating others. Surely there must be a better way than using intuition?\nB. In the 1960s a young American research psychologist, Daniel Kahneman, became\ninterested in people's inability to make logical decisions. That launched him on a career to\nshow just how irrationally people behave in practice. When Kahneman and his colleagues\nfirst started work, the idea of applying psychological insights to economics and business\ndecisions was seen as rather bizarre. But in the past decade the fields of behavioural\nfinance and behavioural economics have blossomed, and in 2002 Kahneman shared a\nNobel prize in economics for his work. Today he is in demand by business organizations\nand international banking companies. But, he says, there are plenty of institutions that still\nfail to understand the roots of their poor decisions. He claims that, far from being random,\nthese mistakes are systematic and predictable.\nC. One common cause of problems in decision-making is over-optimism. Ask most\npeople about the future, and they will see too much blue sky ahead, even if past\nexperience suggests otherwise. Surveys have shown that people's forecasts of\nfuture stock market movements are far more optimistic than past long-term returns\nwould justify. The same goes for their hopes of ever-rising prices for their homes or\ndoing well in games of chance. Such optimism can be useful for managers or\nsportsmen, and sometimes turns into a self-fulfilling prophecy. But most of the time\nit results in wasted effort and dashed hopes. Kahneman's work points to three types\nof over-confidence. First, people tend to exaggerate their own skill and prowess; in\npolls, far fewer than half the respondents admit to having below-average skills in,\nsay, driving. Second, they overestimate the amount of control they have over the\nfuture, forgetting about luck and chalking up success solely to skill. And third, in\ncompetitive pursuits such as dealing on shares, they forget that they have to judge\ntheir skills against those of the competition.\nD. Another source of wrong decisions is related to the decisive effect of the initial\nmeeting, particularly in negotiations over money. This is referred to as the 'anchor\neffect'. Once a figure has been mentioned, it takes a strange hold over the human\nmind. The asking price quoted in a house sale, for example, tends to become\naccepted by all parties as the 'anchor' around which negotiations take place. Much\nthe same goes for salary negotiations or mergers and acquisitions. If nobody has\nmuch information to go on, a figure can provide comfort - even though it may lead to\na terrible mistake.\nE. In addition, mistakes may arise due to stubbornness. No one likes to abandon a\ncherished belief, and the earlier a decision has been taken, the harder it is to\nabandon it. Drug companies must decide early to cancel a failing research project to\navoid wasting money, but may find it difficult to admit they have made a mistake. In\n \n1\n\nthe same way, analysts may have become wedded early to a single explanation that\ncoloured their perception. A fresh eye always helps.\nF. People also tend to put a lot of emphasis on things they have seen and\nexperienced themselves, which may not be the best guide to decision-making. For\nexample, somebody may buy an overvalued share because a relative has made\nthousands on it, only to get his fingers burned. In finance, too much emphasis on\ninformation close at hand helps to explain the tendency by most investors to invest\nonly within the country they live in. Even though they know that diversification is\ngood for their portfolio, a large majority of both Americans and Europeans invest far\ntoo heavily in the shares of their home countries. They would be much better off\nspreading their risks more widely.\nG. More information is helpful in making any decision but, says Kahneman, people\nspend proportionally too much time on small decisions and not enough on big ones.\nThey need to adjust the balance. During the boom years, some companies put as\nmuch effort into planning their office party as into considering strategic mergers.\nH. Finally, crying over spilled milk is not just a waste of time; it also often colours\npeople's perceptions of the future. Some stock market investors trade far too\nfrequently because they are chasing the returns on shares they wish they had\nbought earlier.\nI. Kahneman reckons that some types of businesses are much better than others at\ndealing with risk. Pharmaceutical companies, which are accustomed to many\nfailures and a few big successes in their drug-discovery programmes, are fairly\nrational about their risk-taking. But banks, he says, have a long way to go. They may\ntake big risks on a few huge loans, but are extremely cautious about their much\nmore numerous loans to small businesses, many of which may be less risky than\nthe big ones. And the research has implications for governments too. They face a\nwhole range of sometimes conflicting political pressures, which means they are\neven more likely to take irrational decisions.\n \n2",
