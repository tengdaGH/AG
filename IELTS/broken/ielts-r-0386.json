Violins made by long-dead Italian craftsmen from the Cremona region are beautiful\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nworks of art, coveted by collectors as well as players. Particularly outstanding violins\nhave reputedly changed hands for over a million pounds. In contrast, fine modern\ninstruments can be bought for under \u00a3100. Do such figures really reflect such large\ndifferences in quality? After more than a hundred years of vigorous debate, this\nquestion remains highly contentious, provoking strongly held but divergent views\namong musicians, violin makers and scientists alike.\nB. Every violin, whether a Stradivarius or the cheapest factory- made copy, has a\n          \n \n \ndistinctive 'voice\u2019 of its 0. Just as any musician can immediately recognise the\ndifference between Domingo and Pavarotti singing the same operatic aria, so a\nskilled violinist can distinguish between different qualities in the sound produced by\nindividual Stradivari or Guarneri violins. Individual notes on a single instrument sound\ndifferent each time they are played, which suggests that the perceived tone of a violin\nmust be related to the overall design of the instrument, rather than the frequencies of\nparticular resonances on it. But although various attempts have been made to\nanalyse such global properties, it is extremely difficult to distinguish between a fine\nStradivarius instrument and an indifferent modern copy on the basis of the measured\nresponse alone. The ear is a supreme detection device, and a system has yet to be\ndeveloped which can match the brain's sophisticated ability to assess complex\nsounds.\nC. So how do skilled\nconstruction process? They begin by selecting a wood of the highest possible quality\nfor the front and back plates (or parts of the violin), which they test by tapping with a\nhammer and judging how well it 'rings\u2019. The next important step is to skillfully carve\nthe plates out of the solid wood, taking great care to get the right degree of arching\nand variations in thickness. Traditional makers optimise the thickness by testing the\n\u2018feel\u2019 of the plates when they are flexed, and by the sounds produced when they are\ntapped at different positions with the knuckles.\nviolinmakers optimise the tone of an instrument during the\n          \nHowever, in the last 50 years or so a group of violin makers has emerged who\nhave tried to take a more overtly scientific approach to violin making. One common\npractice they have adopted is to replace the traditional flexing and tapping of plates\nby controlled measurements. During the carving process, the thinned plates are\nsprinkled with flakes of glitter and suspended horizontally above a loudspeaker. The\nglitter forms a pattern each time the loudspeaker excites a resonance. The aim is to\ninteractively 'tune' these first few free plate resonances to specified patterns.\nD.\nUnfortunately, there are very few examples of such measurements for really\nfine Italian instruments because their owners are naturally reluctant to allow their\nviolins to be taken apart for the sake of science. The few tests that have been\nperformed suggest that the first Italian makers may have tuned the resonant modes\nof the individual plates - which they could identify as they tapped them - to exact\nE.\n \n1\n\n          \nmusical intervals. This would be consistent with the prevailing Renaissance view of\n\u2019perfection1, which was measured in terms of numbers and exact ratios. However,\nthere is no historical data to support this case.\n          \n \nAnother factor that affects sound quality is the presence of moisture. To\nachieve the quality of \u201cvibrancy\u201d in a violin requires high-quality wood with low internal\ndamping. By measuring the pattern of growth-rings in the wood of a Stradivarius, we\nknow that the Italian violin makers sometimes used planks of wood that had only\nbeen seasoned for five years. However, such wood is now 300 years old, and the\nintrinsic internal damping will almost certainly have decreased with time. The age of\nthe wood may therefore automatically contribute to the improved quality of older\ninstruments. This may also explain why the quality of a modern instrument appears to\nimprove in its first few years.\nF.\n          \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAnother factor thought to account for sound quality is the nature of the varnish\nused to protect the instrument. One of the most popular theories for well over a\ncentury to account for the Stradivarius secret has been that the varnish had some\nsort of 'magic' composition. However, historical research has shown that it was very\nsimilar to the varnish used today. So apart from the possibility that the Italian varnish\nwas contaminated with the wings of passing insects and debris from the workshop\nfloor, there is no convincing evidence to support the idea of a secret formula.\nG.\n             \n \nOther researchers, meanwhile, have claimed that Stradivarius's secret was to\nsoak the timber in water, to leach out supposedly harmful chemicals, before it was\nseasoned. Although this would be consistent with the idea that the masts and cars of\nrecently sunken Venetian war galleys might have been used to make violins, other\nscientific and historical evidence to support this view is unconvincing.\nH.\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nIn conclusion, science has not provided any convincing evidence to set\nCremonese instruments apart from the finest violins made by skilled craftsmen today.\nIndeed, some leading soloists do occasionally play on modern instruments. However,\nthe foremost soloists - and, not surprisingly, violin dealers, who have a vested interest\nin maintaining the Cremonese legend of intrinsic superiority - remain utterly\nunconvinced.\nI.\n \n2",
