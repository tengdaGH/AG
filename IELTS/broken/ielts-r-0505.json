In some California housing estates, a key alone is insufficient to get someone in\nthe door; his or her voice print must also be verified. And soon, customers at some\nJapanese banks will have to present their faces for scanning before they can enter the\nbuilding and withdraw their money.\nB\nAll of these are applications of biometrics, a little-known but fast-growing technology that\ninvolves the use of physical or biological characteristics to identify individuals. In use for\nmore than a decade at some high- security government institutions in the United States\nand Canada, biometrics are now rapidly popping up in the everyday world. Already, more\nthan 10,000 facilities, from prisons to day-care centres, monitor people's fingerprints or\nother physical parts to ensure that they are who they claim to be. Some 60 biometric\ncompanies around the world pulled in at least $22 million last year and that grand total is\nexpected to mushroom to at least $50 million by 1999.\nC\nBiometric security systems operate by storing a digitised record of some unique human\nfeature. When an authorised user wishes to enter or use the facility, the system scans the\nperson's corresponding characteristics and attempts to match them against those on\nrecord. Systems using fingerprints, hands, voices, irises, retinas and faces are already on\nthe market. Others using typing patterns and even body odours are in various stages of\ndevelopment.\nD\nFingerprint scanners are currently the most widely deployed type of biometric application,\nthanks to their growing use over the last 20 years by law-enforcement agencies. Sixteen\nAmerican states now use biometric fingerprint verification systems to check that people\nclaiming welfare payments are genuine. In June, politicians in Toronto voted to do the\nsame, with a pilot project beginning next year.\nE\nTo date, the most widely used commercial biometric system is the handkey, a type of hand\nscanner which reads the unique shape, size and irregularities of people's hands. Originally\ndeveloped for nuclear powerplants, the handkey received its big break when it was used to\ncontrol access to the Olympic Village in Atlanta by more than 65,000 athletes, trainers and\nsupport staff Now there are scores of other applications.\nF\nAround the world, the market is growing rapidly. Malaysia, for example, is preparing to\nequip all of its airports with biometric face scanners to match passengers with luggage. And\n \n1\n\nJapan's largest maker of cash dispensers is developing new machines that incorporate iris\nscanners. The first commercial biometric, a hand reader used by an American firm to\nmonitor employee attendance, was introduced in 1974. But only in the past few years has\nthe technology improved enough for the prices to drop sufficiently to make them\ncommercially viable. 'When we started four years ago, I had to explain to everyone what a\nbiometric is,' says one marketing expert. Now, there's much more awareness out there.'\nG \nNot surprisingly, biometrics raise thorny questions about privacy and the potential for\nabuse. Some worry that governments and industry will be tempted to use the technology to\nmonitor individual behaviour. If someone used your fingerprints to match your health-\ninsurance records with a credit-card record showing you regularly bought lots of cigarettes\nand fatty foods,' says one policy analyst, 'you would see your insurance payments go\nthrough the roof.' In Toronto, critics of the welfare fingerprint plan complained that it would\nstigmatise recipients by forcing them to submit to a procedure widely identified with\ncriminals.\nH\nNonetheless, support for biometrics is growing in Toronto as it is in many other\ncommunities. In an increasingly crowded and complicated world, biometrics may well be a\ntechnology whose time has come.\n \n2",
