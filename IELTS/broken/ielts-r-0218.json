A lone humpback whale travelled more\nthan 9,800 kilometres from breeding areas in Brazil to those in Madagascar, setting a\nrecord for the longest mammal migration ever documented.\nHumpback whales (Megaptera novaeangliae) are known to have some of the longest\nmigration distances of all mammals, and this huge journey is about 400 kilometres farther\nthan the previous humpback record. The finding was made by Peter Stevick, a biologist at\nthe College of the Atlantic in Bar Harbor, Maine.\nThe whale\u2019s journey was unusual not only for its length, but also because it travelled across\nalmost 90 degrees of longitude from west to east. Typically, humpbacks move in a north-\nsouth direction between cold feeding areas and warm breeding grounds - and the longest\njourneys which have been recorded until now have been between breeding and feeding\nsites.\nThe whale, a female, was first spotted off the coast of Brazil, where researchers\nphotographed its tail fluke and took skin samples for chromosome testing to determine the\nanimal's sex. Two years later, a tourist on a whale-watching boat snapped a photo of the\nhumpback near Madagascar.\nTo match the two sightings, Stevick\u2019s team used an extensive international catalogue of\nphotographs of the undersides of tail flukes, which have distinctive markings. Researchers\nroutinely compare the markings in each new photograph to those in the archive.\nThe scientists then estimated the animal\u2019s shortest possible route: an arc skirting the\nsouthern tip of South Africa and heading north-east towards Madagascar. The minimum\ndistance is 9,800 kilometres, says Stevick, but this is likely to be an underestimate,\nbecause the whale probably took a detour to feed on krill in the Southern Ocean near\nAntarctica before reaching its destination.\nMost humpback-whale researchers focus their efforts on the Northern Hemisphere\nbecause the Southern Ocean near the Antarctic is a hostile environment and it is hard to\nget to, explains Rochelle Constantine, who studies the ecology of humpback whales at the\nUniversity of Auckland in New Zealand. But, for whales, oceans in the Southern\nHemisphere are wider and easier to travel across, says Constantine. Scientists will\nprobably observe more long-distance migrations in the Southern Hemisphere as satellite\ntracking becomes increasingly common, she adds.\nDaniel Palacios, an oceanographer at the University of Hawaii at Manoa, says that the\nrecord-breaking journey could indicate that migration patterns are shifting as populations\nbegin to recover from near-extinction and the population increases. But the reasons why\nthe whale did not follow the usual migration routes remain a mystery. She could have been\nexploring new habitats, or simply have lost her way. 'We generally think of humpback\nwhales as very well studied, but then they surprise us with things like this,\u2019 Palacios says.\n\u2018Undoubtedly there are a lot of things we still don\u2019t know about whale migration.\u2019\n \n1",
