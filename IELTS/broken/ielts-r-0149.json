    "passage_text": "Reading Practice\n \nEndless Harvest\nMore than two hundred years ago, Russian explorers and fur hunters landed on the\nAleutian Islands, a volcanic archipelago in the North Pacific, and learned of a land mass\nthat lay farther to the north. 'The islands\u2019 native inhabitants called this land mass Aleyska,\nthe \u2018Great Land\u2019; today, we know it as Alaska.\nThe forty-ninth state to join the United States of America (in 1959), Alaska is fully one-fifth\nthe size of the mainland 48 states combined. It shares, with Canada, the second\nlongest river system in North America and has over half the coastline of the United States.\nThe rivers feed into the Bering Sea and Gulf of Alaska - cold, nutrient-rich waters which\nsupport tens of millions of seabirds, and over 400 species of fish, shellfish, crustaceans,\nand molluscs. Taking advantage of this rich bounty, Alaska\u2019s commercial fisheries have\ndeveloped into some of the largest in the world.\nAccording to the Alaska Department of Fish and Game (ADF&G), Alaska\u2019s commercial\nfisheries landed hundreds of thousands of tonnes of shellfish and herring, and well over a\nmillion tonnes of groundfish (cod, sole, perch and pollock) in 2000. The true cultural heart\nand soul of Alaska\u2019s fisheries, however, is salmon. \u2018Salmon,\u2019 notes writer Susan Ewing in\nThe Great Alaska Nature Factbook, \u2018pump through Alaska like blood through a heart,\nbringing rhythmic, circulating nourishment to land, animals and people.\u2019 The \u2018predictable\nabundance of salmon allowed some native cultures to flourish,\u2019 and \u2018dying spawners* feed\nbears, eagles, other animals, and ultimately the soil itself.\u2019 All five species of Pacific salmon\n- chinook, or king; chum, or dog; coho, or silver; sockeye, or red; and pink, or humpback -\nspawn** in Alaskan waters, and 90% of all Pacific salmon commercially caught in North\nAmerica are produced there. Indeed, if Alaska was an independent nation, it would be die\nlargest producer of wild salmon in the world. During 2000, commercial catches of Pacific\nsalmon in Alaska exceeded 320,000 tonnes, with an ex-vessel value of over $US 260\nmillion.\nCatches have not always been so healthy. Between 1940 and 1959, overfishing led to\ncrashes in salmon populations so severe that in 1953 Alaska was declared a federal\ndisaster area. With the onset of statehood, however, the State of Alaska took over\nmanagement of its own fisheries, guided by a state constitution which mandates that\nAlaska\u2019s natural resources be managed on a sustainable basis. At that time, statewide\nharvests totalled around 25 million salmon. Over the next few decades average catches\nsteadily increased as a result of this policy of sustainable management, until, during the\n1990s, annual harvests were well in excess of 100 million, and on several occasions over\n200 million fish.\nThe primary reason for such increases is what is known as \u2018In-Season Abundance-Based\nManagement\u2019. There are biologists throughout the state constantly monitoring adult fish as\nthey show up to spawn. The biologists sit in streamside counting towers, study sonar,\nwatch from aeroplanes, and talk to fishermen. The salmon season in Alaska is not pre-set.\nThe fishermen know the approximate time of year when they will be allowed to fish, but on\nany given day, one or more field biologists in a particular area can put a halt to fishing.\nEven sport fishing can be brought to a halt. It is this management mechanism that has\nallowed Alaska salmon stocks - and, accordingly, Alaska salmon fisheries \u2014 to prosper,\n \n1\n\neven as salmon populations in the rest of the United States are increasingly considered\nthreatened or even endangered.\nIn 1999, the Marine Stewardship Council (MSC)*** commissioned a review of the Alaska\nsalmon fishery. The Council, which was founded in 1996, certifies fisheries that meet high\nenvironmental standards, enabling them to use a label that recognises their environmental\nresponsibility. The MSC has established a set of criteria by which commercial fisheries can\nbe judged. Recognising the potential benefits of being identified as environmentally\nresponsible, fisheries approach the Council requesting to undergo the certification process.\nThe MSC then appoints a certification committee, composed of a panel of fisheries experts,\nwhich gathers information and opinions from fishermen, biologists, government officials,\nindustry representatives, non-governmental organisations and others.\nSome observers thought the Alaska salmon fisheries would not have any chance of\ncertification when, in the months leading up to MSC\u2019s final decision, salmon runs\nthroughout western Alaska completely collapsed. In the Yukon and Kuskokwim rivers,\nchinook and chum runs were probably the poorest since statehood; subsistence\ncommunities throughout the region, who normally have priority over commercial fishing,\nwere devastated.\nThe crisis was completely unexpected, but researchers believe it had nothing to do with\nimpacts of fisheries. Rather, they contend, it was almost certainly the result of climatic\nshifts, prompted in part by cumulative effects of the el ni\u00f1o/la ni\u00f1a phenomenon on Pacific\nOcean temperatures, culminating in a harsh winter in which huge numbers of salmon eggs\nwere frozen. It could have meant the end as far as the certification process was concerned.\nHowever, the state reacted quickly, closing down all fisheries, even those necessary for\nsubsistence purposes.\nIn September 2000, MSC announced that the Alaska salmon fisheries qualified for\ncertification. Seven companies producing Alaska salmon were immediately granted\npermission to display the MSC logo on their products. Certification is for an initial period of\nfive years, with an annual review to ensure that the fishery is continuing to meet the\nrequired standards.\n* spawners: fish that have released eggs\n** spawn: release eggs\n*** MSC: a joint venture between WWF (World Wildlife Fund) and Unilever, a Dutch-based\nmulti-national\n \n2",
