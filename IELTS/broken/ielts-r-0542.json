    "passage_text": "Reading Practice\n \nThe Revolutionary Bridges of Robert Maillart\n \nSwiss engineer Robert Maillart built some of the greatest bridges of the 20th century.\nHis designs elegantly solved a basic engineering problem: how to support\nenormous weights using a slender arch.\n \nA Just as railway bridges were the great structural symbols of the 19th century,\nhighway bridges became the engineering emblems of the 20th century. The\ninvention of the automobile created an irresistible demand for paved roads and\nvehicular bridges throughout the developed world. The type of bridge needed for\ncars and trucks, however, is fundamentally different from that needed for\nlocomotives. Most highway bridges carry lighter loads than railway bridges do, and\ntheir roadways can be sharply curved or steeply sloping. To meet these needs, many\nturn-of-the-century bridge designers began working with a new building material:\nreinforced concrete, which has steel bars embedded in it. And the master of this new\nmaterial was Swiss structural engineer, Robert Maillart.\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nB Early in his career, Maillart developed a unique method for designing bridges,\nbuildings and other concrete structures. He rejected the complex mathematical\nanalysis of loads and stresses that was being enthusiastically adopted by most of\nhis contemporaries. At the same time, he also eschewed the decorative approach\ntaken by many bridge builders of his time. He resisted imitating architectural styles\nand adding design elements solely for ornamentation. Maillart\u2019s method was a form\nof creative intuition. He had a knack for conceiving new shapes to solve classic\nengineering problems] And because he worked in a highly competitive field, one of his\ngoals was economy - he won design and construction contracts because his structures\nwere reasonably priced, often less costly than all his rivals\u2019 proposals.\n \nC Maillart\u2019s first important bridge was built in the small Swiss town of Zuoz. The\nlocal officials had initially wanted a steel bridge to span the 30-metre wide Inn River,\nbut Maillart argued that he could build a more elegant bridge made of reinforced\nconcrete for about the same cost. His crucial innovation was incorporating the\nbridge\u2019s arch and roadway into a form called the hollow-box arch, which would\nsubstantially reduce the bridge\u2019s expense by minimising the amount of concrete\nneeded. In a conventional arch bridge the weight of the roadway is transferred by\ncolumns to the arch, which must be relatively thick. In Maillart\u2019s design, though, the\nroadway and arch were connected by three vertical walls, forming two hollow boxes\nrunning under the roadway (see diagram). The big advantage of this design was that\nbecause the arch would not have to bear the load alone, it could be much thinner - as little\nas one-third as thick as the arch in the conventional bridge.\nD His first masterpiece, however, was the 1905 Tavanasa Bridge over the Rhine river\nin the Swiss Alps. In this design, Maillart removed the parts of the vertical walls\nwhich were not essential because they carried no load. This produced a slender,\nlighter-looking form, which perfectly met the bridge\u2019s structural requirements. But\nthe Tavanasa Bridge gained little favourable publicity in Switzerland; on the\ncontrary, it aroused strong aesthetic objections from public officials who were more\ncomfortable with old-fashioned stone-faced bridges. Maillart, who had founded his\nown construction firm in 1902, was unable to win any more bridge projects, so he\n \n1\n\n \nshifted his focus to designing buildings, water tanks and other structures made of\nreinforced concrete and did not resume his work on concrete bridges until the early\n1920s.\n \nE His most important breakthrough during this period was the development of the\ndeck-stiffened arch, the first example of which was the Flienglibach Bridge, built in\n1923. An arch bridge is somewhat like an inverted cable. A cable curves downward\nwhen a weight is hung from it, an arch bridge curves upward to support the roadway\nand the compression in the arch balances the dead load of the traffic. For aesthetic\nreasons, Maillart wanted a thinner arch and his solution was to connect the arch to\nthe roadway with transverse walls. In this way, Maillart justified making the arch as\nthin as he could reasonably build it. His analysis accurately predicted the behaviour\nof the bridge but the leading authorities of Swiss engineering would argue against\nhis methods for the next quarter of a century.\n \nF Over the next 10 years, Maillart concentrated on refining the visual appearance of\nthe deck-stiffened arch. His best-known structure is the Salginatobel Bridge,\ncompleted in 1930. He won the competition for the contract because his design was\nthe least expensive of the 19 submitted - the bridge and road were built for only\n700,000 Swiss francs, equivalent to some $3.5 million today. Salginatobel was also\nMaillart\u2019s longest span, at 90 metres and it had the most dramatic setting of all his\nstructures, vaulting 80 metres above the ravine of the Salgina brook. In 1991 it\nbecame the first concrete bridge to be designated an international historic landmark.\nG Before his death in 1940, Maillart completed other remarkable bridges and\ncontinued to refine his designs. However, architects often recognised the high\nquality of Maillart\u2019s structures before his fellow engineers did and in 1947 the\narchitectural section of the Museum of Modern Art in New York City devoted a major\nexhibition entirely to his works. In contrast, very few American structural engineers\nat that time had even heard of Maillart. In the following years, however, engineers\nrealised that Maillart\u2019s bridges were more than just aesthetically pleasing - they were\ntechnically unsurpassed. Maillart\u2019s hollow-box arch became the dominant design\nform for medium and long- span concrete bridges in the US. In Switzerland,\nprofessors finally began to teach Maillart\u2019s ideas, which then influenced a new\ngeneration of designers.\n \n2",
