    "passage_text": "Reading Practice\nGrimm\u2019s Fairy Tales\n \nThe Brothers Grimm, Jacob and Wilhelm, named their story collection Children\u2019s and\nHousehold Tales and published the first of its seven editions in Germany in 1812. The table\nof contents reads like an A-list of fairy-tale celebrities: Cinderella, Sleeping Beauty, Snow\nWhite, Little Red Riding Hood, Rapunzel, Rumpelstiltskin, Hansel and Gretel, the Frog\nKing. Drawn mostly from oral narratives, the 210 stories in die Grimm\u2019s\u2019 collection\nrepresent an anthology of fairy tales, animal fables, rustic farces, and religious allegories\nthat remain unrivalled to this day.\nSuch lasting fame would have shocked the humble Grimms. During their lifetimes the\ncollection sold modestly in Germany, at first only a few hundred copies a year. The early\neditions were not even aimed at children. The brothers initially refused to consider\nillustrations, and scholarly footnotes took up almost as much space as the tales\nthemselves. Jacob and Wilhelm viewed themselves as patriotic folklorists, not as\nentertainers of children. They began their work at a time when Germany had been overrun\nby the French under Napoleon, who was intent on suppressing local culture. As young,\nworkaholic scholars, single and sharing a cramped flat, the Brothers Grimm undertook the\nfairy-tale collection with the goal of serving the endangered oral tradition of Germany.\n \nFor much of the 19th century teachers, parents, and religious figures, particularly in the\nUnited States, deplored the Grimms\u2019 collection for its raw, uncivilized content. Offended\nadults objected to the gruesome punishments inflicted on the stories\u2019 villains. In the original\n\u201cSnow White\u201d the evil stepmother is forced to dance in red-hot iron shoes until she falls\ndown dead. Even today some protective parents shy from the Grimms\u2019 tales because of\ntheir reputation for violence.\nDespite its sometimes rocky reception, Children\u2019s and Household Tales gradually took root\nwith the public. The brothers had not foreseen that the appearance of their work would\ncoincide with a great flowering of children\u2019s literature in Europe. English publishers led the\nway, issuing high-quality picture books such as Jack and the Beanstalk and handsome\nfolktale collections, all to satisfy a newly literate audience seeking virtuous material for the\nnursery. Once the Brothers Grimm sighted this new public, they set about refining and\nsoftening their tales, which had originated centuries earlier as earthy peasant fare. In the\nGrimms\u2019 hands, cruel mothers became nasty stepmothers, unmarried lovers were made\nchaste, and the incestuous father was recast as the devil.\nIn the 20th century the Grimms\u2019 fairy tales have come to rule the bookshelves of children\u2019s\nbedrooms. The stories read like dreams come true: handsome lads and beautiful damsels,\narmed with magic, triumph over giants and witches and wild beasts. They outwit mean,\nselfish adults. Inevitably the boy and girl fall in love and live happily ever after. And parents\nkeep reading because they approve of the finger-wagging lessons inserted into the stories:\nkeep your promises, don\u2019t talk to strangers, work hard, obey your parents. According to the\nGrimms, the collection served as \u201ca manual of manners\u201d.\nAltogether some 40 persons delivered tales to the Grimms. Many of the storytellers came\nto the Grimms\u2019 house in Kassel. The brothers particularly welcomed the visits of Dorothea\n \n1\n\nViehmann, a widow who walked to town to sell produce from her garden. An innkeeper\ndaughter, Viehmann had grown up listening to stories from travellers on the road to\nFrankfurt. Among her treasure was \u201cAschenputtel\u201d -Cinderella. Marie Hassenpflug was a\n20-year-old friend of their sister, Charlotte, from a well-bred, French-speaking family.\nMarie\u2019s wonderful stories blended motifs from the oral tradition and from Perrault\u2019s\ninfluential 1697 book, Tales of My Mother Goose, which contained elaborate versions of\n\u201cLittle Red Riding Hood\u201d, \u201cSnow White\u201d, and \u201cSleeping Beauty\u201d, among others. Many of\nthese had been adapted from earlier Italian tales.\n \nGiven that the origins of many of the Grimm fairy tales reach throughout Europe and into\nthe Middle East and Orient, the question must be asked: How German are the Grimm\ntales? Very, says scholar Heinz Rolleke. Love of the underdog, rustic simplicity, creative\nenergy\u2014these are Teutonic traits. The coarse texture of life during medieval times in\nGermany, when many of the tales entered the oral tradition, also coloured the narratives.\nThroughout Europe, children were often neglected and abandoned, like Hansel and Gretel.\nAccused witches were burned at the stake, like the evil mother-in-law in \u201cThe Six Swans\u201d.\n\u201cThe cruelty in the stories was not the Grimm\u2019s fantasy\u201d, Rolleke points out\u201d It reflected the\nlaw-and-order system of the old times\u201d.\nThe editorial fingerprints left by the Grimms betray the specific values of 19th-century\nChristian, bourgeois German society. But that has not stopped the tales from being\nembraced by almost every culture and nationality in the world. What accounts for this\nwidespread, enduring popularity? Bernhard Lauer points to the \u201cuniversal style\u201d of the\nwriting, you have no concrete descriptions of the land, or the clothes, or the forest, or the\ncastles. It makes the stories timeless and placeless,\u201d The tales allow us to express \u2018our\nutopian longings\u2019,\u201d says Jack Zipes of the University of Minnesota, whose 1987 translation\nof the complete fairy tales captures the rustic vigour of the original text. They show a\nstriving for happiness that none of us knows but that we sense is possible. We can identify\nwith the heroes of the tales and become in our mind the masters and mistresses of our own\ndestinies.\u201d\nFairy tales provide a workout for the unconscious, psychoanalysts maintain. Bruno\nBettelheim famously promoted the therapeutic of the Grimms\u2019 stories, calling fairy tales the\n\u201cgreat comforters. By confronting fears and phobias, symbolized by witches, heartless\nstepmothers, and hungry wolves, children find they can master their anxieties. Bettelheim\u2019s\ntheory continues to be hotly debated. But most young readers aren\u2019t interested in\nexercising their unconsciousness. The Grimm tales, in fact, please in an infinite number of\nways, something about them seems to mirror whatever moods or interests we bring to our\nreading of them. The flexibility of interpretation suits them for almost any time and any\nculture.\n \n2",
