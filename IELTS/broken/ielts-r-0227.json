    "passage_text": "Reading Practice\n \nInside the mind of the consumer\nCould brain-scanning technology provide an accurate way to assess the appeal\nof new products and the effectiveness of advertising?\nA\nMARKETING people are no longer prepared to take your word for it that you favour one\nproduct over another. They want to scan your brain to see which one you really prefer.\nUsing the tools of neuroscientists, such as electroencephalogram (EEG) mapping and\nfunctional magnetic-resonance imaging (fMRI), they are trying to learn more about the\nmental processes behind purchasing decisions. The resulting fusion of neuroscience and\nmarketing is inevitably, being called 'neuromarketing\u2019.\nB\nThe first person to apply brain-imaging technology in this way was Gerry Zaltman of\nHarvard University, in the late 1990s. The idea remained in obscurity until 2001, when\nBrightHouse, a marketing consultancy based in Atlanta, Georgia, set up a dedicated\nneuromarketing arm, BrightHouse Neurostrategies Group. (BrightHouse lists Coca-Cola,\nDelta Airlines and Home Depot among its clients.) But the company's name may itself\nsimply be an example of clever marketing. BrightHouse does not scan people while\nshowing them specific products or campaign ideas, but bases its work on the results of\nmore general fMRI-based research into consumer preferences and decision-making carried\nout at Emory University in Atlanta.\n \nC\nCan brain scanning really be applied to marketing? The basic principle is not that different\nfrom focus groups and other traditional forms of market research. A volunteer lies in an\nfMRI machine and is shown images or video clips. In place of an interview or questionnaire,\nthe subject's response is evaluated by monitoring brain activity. fMRIprovides real-time\nimages of brain activity, in which different areas \u201clight up\u201d depending on the level of blood\nflow. This provides clues to the subject's subconscious thought patterns. Neuroscientists\nknow, for example, that the sense of self is associated with an area of the brain known as\nthe medial prefrontal cortex. A flow of blood to that area while the subject is looking at a\nparticular logo suggests that he or she identifies with that brand.\n \n \n \n \nD\nAt first, it seemed that only companies in Europe were prepared to admit that they used\nneuromarketing. Two carmakers, DaimlerChrysler in Germany and Ford's European arm,\nran pilot studies in 2003. But more recently, American companies have become more open\nabout their use of neuromarketing. Lieberman Research Worldwide, a marketing firm\nbased in Los Angeles, is collaborating with the California Institute of Technology (Caltech)\nto enable movie studios to market-test film trailers. More controversially, the New York\nTimes recently reported that a political consultancy, FKF Research, has been studying the\neffectiveness of campaign commercials using neuromarketing techniques.\nE\n \n1\n\nWhether all this is any more than a modern-day version of phrenology, the Victorian\nobsession with linking lumps and bumps in the skull to personality traits, is unclear. There\nhave been no large-scale studies, so scans of a handful of subjects may not be a reliable\nguide to consumer behaviour in general. Of course, focus groups and surveys are flawed\ntoo: strong personalities can steer the outcomes of focus groups, and people do not always\ntell opinion pollsters the truth. And even honest people cannot always explain their\npreferences.\nF\nThat is perhaps where neuromarketing has the most potential. When asked about cola\ndrinks, most people claim to have a favourite brand, but cannot say why they prefer that\nbrand\u2019s taste. An unpublished study of attitudes towards two well- known cola drinks. Brand\nA and Brand 13. carried out last year in a college of medicine in the US found that most\nsubjects preferred Brand B in a blind tasting fMRI scanning showed that drinking Brand B lit\nup a region called the ventral putamen, which is one of the brain s \u2018reward centres\u2019, far\nmore brightly than Brand A. But when told which drink was which, most subjects said they\npreferred Brand A, which suggests that its stronger brand outweighs the more pleasant\ntaste of the other drink.\nG\n\u201cPeople form many unconscious attitudes that are obviously beyond traditional methods\nthat utilise introspection,\u201d says Steven Quartz, a neuroscientist at Caltech who is\ncollaborating with Lieberman Research. With over $100 billion spent each year on\nmarketing in America alone, any firm that can more accurately analyse how customers\nrespond to products, brands and advertising could make a fortune.\nH\nConsumer advocates are wary. Gary Ruskin of Commercial Alert, a lobby group, thinks\nexisting marketing techniques are powerful enough. \u201cAlready, marketing is deeply\nimplicated in many serious pathologies,\u201d he says. \u201cThat is especially true of children, who\nare suffering from an epidemic of marketing- related diseases, including obesity and type-2\ndiabetes. Neuromarketing is a tool to amplify these trends.\u201d\nI\nDr Quartz counters that neuromarketing techniques could equally be used for benign\npurposes. \u201cThere are ways to utilise these technologies to create more responsible\nadvertising,\u201d he says. Brain-scanning could, for example, be used to determine when\npeople are capable of making free choices, to ensure that advertising falls within those\nbounds.\nJ\nAnother worry is that brain-scanning is an invasion of privacy and that information on the\npreferences of specific individuals will be misused. But neuromarketing studies rely on\nsmall numbers of volunteer subjects, so that seems implausible. Critics also object to the\nuse of medical equipment for frivolous rather than medical purposes. But as Tim Ambler, a\nneuromarketing researcher at the London Business School, says: \u2018A tool is a tool, and if the\nowner of the tool gets a decent rent for hiring it out, then that subsidises the cost of the\nequipment, and everybody wins.\u2019 Perhaps more brain-scanning will some day explain why\n \n2\n\nsome people like the idea of neuromarketing, but others do not.\n \n3",
