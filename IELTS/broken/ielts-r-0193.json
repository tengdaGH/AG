    "passage_text": "Reading Practice\n \nGriffith and American Films\nMovies are key cultural artifacts that offer a window into American cultural and social\nhistory. A mixture of art, business, and popular entertainment, the movies provide a host of\ninsights into Americans\u2019 shifting ideals, fantasies, and preoccupations\nA. Many films of the early silent era dealt with gender relations. Before 1905, as Kathy\nPeiss has argued, movie screens were filled with salacious sexual imagery and risque\nhumor, drawn from burlesque halls and vaudeville theaters. Early films offered many\nglimpses of women disrobing or of passionate kisses. As the movies\u2019 female audience\ngrew, sexual titillation and voyeurism persisted. But an ever increasing number of film dealt\nwith the changing work and sexual roles of women in a more sophisticated manner. While\nD.w. Griffith\u2019s films presented an idealized picture of the frail Victorian child-woman, and\nshowed an almost obsessive preoccupation with female honor and chastity, other silent\nmovies presented quite different images of femininity. These ranged from the exotic,\nsexually aggressive vamp to the athletic, energetic \u201cserial queen\u201d; the street smart urban\nworking gal, who repels the sexual advances of her lascivious boss; and cigarette-smoking,\nalcohol drinking chorus girls or burlesque queens.\n \nB. In early 1910, director D.w. Griffith was sent by the Biograph Company to the west coast\nwith his acting troupe, consisting of actors Blanche Sweet, Lillian Gish, Mary Pickford,\nLionel Barrymore, and others. While there, the company decided to explore new territories,\ntraveling several miles north to Hollywood, a little village that was friendly and enjoyed the\nmovie company filming there. By focusing the camera on particular actors and actresses,\nGriffith inadvertently encouraged the development of the star system. As early as 1910,\nnewspapers were deluged with requests for actors\u2019 names. But most studios refused to\ndivulge their identities, fearing the salary demands of popular performers. As one industry\nobserver put it, \u201cIn the \u2018star\u2019 your producer gets not only a \u2018production\u2019 value\u2026but a\n\u2018trademark\u2019 value, and an \u2018insurance\u2019 value which are\u2026very potent in guaranteeing the sale\nof this product.\u201d As the star system emerged, salaries soared. In the course of just two\nyears, the salary of actress Mary Pickford rose from less than $400 a week in 1914 to\n$10,000 a week in 1916. This action made Griffith believe the big potential in movie\nindustry. Thus many competitors completely copy the same system as Griffith used, for the\nconsiderable profits. Additionally, they also study the theory and methods which Griffith\nsuggested.\nC. From the moment America entered the war, Hollywood feared that the industry would be\nsubject to heavy-handed government censorship. But the government itself wanted no\nrepeat of World War I, when the Committee on Public Information had whipped up anti-\nGerman hysteria and oversold the war as \u201ca Crusade not merely to re-win the tomb of\nChrist, but to bring back to earth the rule of right, the peace, goodwill to men and\ngentleness he taught.\u201d\nD. The formation of the movie trust ushered in a period of rationalization within the film\nindustry. Camera and projecting equipment was standardized; film rental fees were fixed;\ntheaters were upgraded; which improved the quality of movies by removing damaged prints\nfrom cnculation. This was also a period intense artistic and technical innovation, as\npioneering directors like David Wark Griffith and others created a new language of film and\n \n1\n\n \nrevolutionized screen narrative.\n \nE. With just six months of film experience, Griffith, a former stage actor, was hired as a\ndirector by the Biograph Company and promised $50 a week and one-twentieth of a cent\nfor every foot of film sold to a rental exchange. Each week, Griffith turned out two or three\none-reelers. While earlier directors had used such cinematic devices as close ups, slow\nmotion, fade-ins and fade-outs, lighting effects, and editing before, Griffith\u2019s great\ncontribution to the movie industry was to show how these techniques could be used to\ncreate a wholly new style of storytelling, distinct from the theater. Griffith\u2019s approach to\nmovie storytelling has been aptly called \u201cphotographic realism. \u201cThis is not to say that he\nmerely wished to record a story accurately; rather he sought to convey the illusion of\nrealism. He demanded that his performers act less in a more lifelike manner, avoiding the\nbroad, exaggerated gestures and pantomiming of emotions that characterized the\nnineteenth century stage. He wanted his performers to take on a role rather than directly\naddressing the camera. Above all, he used close-ups, lighting, editing, and other cinematic\ntechniques convey suspense and other emotions and to focus the audience\u2019s attention on\nindividual performers.\nF. During the 1920s and 1930s, a small group of film companies consolidated then control.\nKnown as the \u201cBig Five\u201d \u2013 Paramount, Warner Brothers, RKO, 20th Century-Fox, and\nLowe\u2019s (MGM) and the \u201cLittle Three\u201d \u2013 Universal, Columbia, and United Artists, they formed\nfully integrated companies. The old film company\u2019s opposition was shocked by new\ntycoons. The confusion of tongues in the foreign version of American films deepened when\nAmerican directors themselves embarked on the shooting of the new version. They did not\nusually speak Spanish (or the given target language) and, at that time, there were only few\ntranslators at the studio\u2019s disposal. For this reason, it was more general to contract Spanish\ndirectors, actors, and screenwriters to produce American films in Spanish for Latin\nAmerican audiences and for the public in the Iberian Peninsula. Hollywood had depended\non overseas markets for as much as 40 percent of its revenue. But in an effort to nurture\nthen own film industries and prevent an excessive outflow of dollars, Britain, France, and\nItaly imposed stiff import tariffs and restrictive quotas on imported American movies.\nG. A basic problem facing today\u2019s Hollywood is the rapidly rising cost of making and\nmarketing a movie: an average of $40 million today. The immense cost of producing\nmovies has led the studios to seek guaranteed hits: blockbuster loaded with high-tech\nspecial effects, sequels, and remakes of earlier movies, foreign films, and even old TV\nshows. Hollywood has also sought to cope with rising costs by focusing ever more intently\non its core audiences. Since the mid-1980s, the movie going audience has continued to\ndecrease in size. Ticket sales fell from 1.2 billion in 1983 to 950 million in 1992, with the\nbiggest drop occurring among adults. And since over half of Hollywood\u2019s profits are earned\noverseas, the target market has to be changed due to the increasing costs and salary of\nmaking a film. The industry has concentrated much of its energy on crude action films\neasily understood by an international audience, featuring stars like Arnold Schwarzenegger\nand Sylvester Stallone.\n \n2",
