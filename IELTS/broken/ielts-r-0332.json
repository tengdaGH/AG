    "passage_text": "Reading Practice\n \nPaper or Computer?\nA. Computer technology was supposed to replace paper. But that hasn\u2019t happened. Every\ncountry in the Western world uses more paper today, on a per- capita basis, than it did ten\nyears ago. The consumption of uncoated free-sheet paper, for instance the most common\nkind of office paper \u2014 rose almost fifteen per cent in the United States between 1995 and\n2000. This is generally taken as evidence of how hard it is to eradicate old, wasteful habits\nand of how stubbornly resistant we are to the efficiencies offered by computerization. A\nnumber of cognitive psychologists and ergonomics experts, however, don\u2019t agree. Paper\nhas persisted, they argue, for very good reasons: when it comes to performing certain\nkinds of cognitive tasks, paper has many advantages over computers. The dismay people\nfeel at the sight of a messy desk \u2014 or the spectacle of air-traffic controllers tracking flights\nthrough notes scribbled on paper strips \u2013 arises from a fundamental confusion about the\nrole that paper plays in our lives.\n \nB. The case for paper is made most eloquently in \u201cThe Myth of the Paperless Office\u201d, by\ntwo social scientists, Abigail Sellen and Richard Harper. They begin their book with an\naccount of a study they conducted at the International Monetary Fund, in Washington, D.c.\nEconomists at the I.M.F. spend most of their time writing reports on complicated economic\nquestions, work that would seem to be perfectly suited to sitting in front of a computer.\nNonetheless, the I.M.F. is awash in paper, and Sellen and Harper wanted to find out why.\nTheir answer is that the business of writing reports \u2013 at least at the I.M.F. is an intensely\ncollaborative process, involving the professional judgments and contributions of many\npeople. The economists bring drafts of reports to conference rooms, spread out the\nrelevant pages, and negotiate changes with one other. They go back to their offices and jot\ndown comments in the margin, taking advantage of the freedom offered by the informality\nof the handwritten note. Then they deliver the annotated draft to the author in person,\ntaking him, page by page, through the suggested changes. At the end of the process, the\nauthor spreads out all the pages with comments on his desk and starts to enter them on\nthe computer \u2014 moving the pages around as he works, organizing and reorganizing,\nsaving and discarding.\nC. Without paper, this kind of collaborative and iterative work process would be much more\ndifficult. According to Sellen and Harper, paper has a unique set of \u201caffordances\u201d \u2014 that is,\nqualities that permit specific kinds of uses. Paper is tangible: we can pick up a document,\nflip through it, read little bits here and there, and quickly get a sense of it. Paper is spatially\nflexible, meaning that we can spread it out and arrange it in the way that suits US best. And\nit\u2019s tailorable: we can easily annotate it, and scribble on it as we read, without altering the\noriginal text. Digital documents, of course, have then own affordances. They can be easily\nsearched, shared, stored, accessed remotely, and linked to other relevant material. But\nthey lack the affordances that really matter to a group of people working together on a\nreport. Sellen and Harper write:\nD. Paper enables a certain kind of thinking. Picture, for instance, the top of your desk.\nChances are that you have a keyboard and a computer screen off to one side, and a clear\nspace roughly eighteen inches square in front of your chair. What covers the rest of the\ndesktop is probably piles- piles of papers, journals, magazines, binders, postcards,\nvideotapes, and all the other artifacts of the knowledge economy. The piles look like a\n \n1\n\nmess, but they aren\u2019t. When a group at Apple Computer studied piling behavior several\nyears ago, they found that even the most disorderly piles usually make perfect sense to the\npiler, and that office workers could hold forth in great detail about the precise history and\nmeaning of thefr piles. The pile closest to the cleared, eighteen-inch-square working area,\nfor example, generally represents the most urgent business, and within that pile the most\nimportant document of all is likely to be at the top. Piles are living, breathing archives. Over\ntime, they get broken down and resorted, sometimes chronologically and sometimes\nthematically and sometimes chronologically and thematically; clues about certain\ndocuments may be physically embedded in the file by, say, stacking a certain piece of\npaper at an angle or inserting dividers into the stack.\n \nE. But why do we pile documents instead of filing them? Because piles represent the\nprocess of active, ongoing thinking. The psychologist Alison Kidd, whose research Sellen\nand Harper refer to extensively, argues that \u201cknowledge workers\u201d use the physical space of\nthe desktop to hold \u201cideas which they cannot yet categorize or even decide how they might\nuse.\u201d The messy desk is not necessarily a sign of disorganization. It may be a sign of\ncomplexity: those who deal with many unresolved ideas simultaneously cannot sort and file\nthe papers on their desks, because they haven\u2019t yet sorted and filed the ideas in their head.\nKidd writes that many of the people she talked to use the papers on their desks as\ncontextual cues to\u2019\u2019 recover a complex set of threads without difficulty and delay\u201d when they\ncome in on a Monday morning, or after their work has been interrupted by a phone call.\nWhat we see when we look at the piles on our desks is, in a sense, the contents of our\nbrains.\nF. This idea that paper facilitates a highly specialized cognitive and social process is a far\ncry from the way we have historically thought about the stuff. Paper first began to\nproliferate in the workplace in the late nineteenth century as part of the move toward\n\u201csystematic management.\u201d To cope with the complexity of the industrial economy,\nmanagers were instituting company-wide policies and demanding monthly, weekly, or even\ndaily updates from their subordinates. Thus was born the monthly sales report, and the\noffice manual and the internal company newsletter. The typewriter took off in the eighteen-\neighties, making it possible to create documents in a fraction of the time it had previously\ntaken, and that was followed closely by the advent of carbon paper, which meant that a\ntypist could create ten copies of that document simultaneously. Paper was important not to\nfacilitate creative collaboration and thought but as an instrument of control.\n \n2",
