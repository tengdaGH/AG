An architecture of disguise is almost complete at Talbot Park in the heart of Auckland\u2019s\nGlen Innes. The place was once described as a state housing ghetto, rife with crime,\nvandalism and other social problems. But today after a $48 million urban renewal\nmakeover, the site is home to 700 residents \u2014 200 more than before \u2014 and has people\nregularly inquiring whether they can buy or rent there. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t look like social housing,\u201d\nHousing New Zealand housing services manager Dene Busby says of the tidy brick and\nweatherboard apartments and townhouses which would look just as much at home in\n\u201cthere is no reason why public housing should look cheap in my view,\u201d says Design Group\narchitect Neil of the eight three-bedroom terrace houses his firm designed.\nB. Talbot Park is a triangle of government-owned land bounded by Apirana Ave, Pilkington\nRd and Point England Rd. In the early 1960s it was developed for state housing built\naround a linear park that ran through the middle. Initially, there was a strong sense of a\nfamily-friendly community. Former residents recall how the Talbot Park reserve played a\nbig part in their childhoods \u2014 a place where the kids in the block came together to play\nsoftball, cricket, tiggy, leapfrog and bullrush. Sometimes they\u2019d play \u201cMaoris against\nPakehas\u201d but without any animosity. \u201cIt was all just good fun\u201d, says Georgie Thompson in\nBen Schrader\u2019s We Call it Home: A History of State Housing in New Zealand. \u201cWe had\nrespect for our neighbours and addressed them by title Mr. and Mrs. soand-so,\u201d she\nrecalls.\nC. Quite what went wrong with Talbot Park is not clear. We call it Home Records that the\ncommunity began to change in the late 1970s as more Pacific Islanders and Europeans\nmoved in. The new arrivals didn\u2019t readily integrate with the community, a \u201cthem and us\u201d\nmentality developed, and residents interacted with their neighbours less. What was clear\nwas the buildings were deteriorating and becoming dilapidated, petty crime was on the rise\nand the reserve \u2014 focus of fond childhood memories \u2014 had become a wasteland and was\nconsidered unsafe.\nD. But it wasn\u2019t until 2002 that Housing New Zealand decided the properties needed\nupgrading. The master renewal plan didn\u2019t take advantage of the maximum\naccommodation density allowable (one unit per 100 sq metres ) but did increase density to\none emit per 180 sq m by refurbishing all 108 star flat units, removing the multis and\nbuilding 111 new home. The Talbot strategy can be summed up as mix, match and\nmanage. Mix up the housing with variety plans from a mix of architects, match house styles\nto what7 s built by the private sector, match tenants to the mix, and manage their\noccupancy. Inevitably cost comes into the equation.\u201d If you\u2019re going to build low cost\nhomes, you\u2019ve got to keep them simple and you can\u2019t afford a fancy bit on them. \u201d says\nMichael Thompson of Architectus which designed the innovative threelevel Atrium\napartments lining two sides of a covered courtyard. At $300,000 per two bedroom unit, the\nbuilding is more expensive but provides for independent disabled accommodation as well\n \n1\n\n \nas offering solar hot water heating and rainwater collection for toilet cisterns and outside\ntaps.\nE. The renewal project budget at $1.5 million which will provide park pathways, planting,\nplaygrounds, drinking fountains, seating, skateboard rails, a half-size basketball hard court,\nand a pavilion. But if there was any doubt this is a low socio-economic area, the\ndemographics for the surrounding Tamaki area are sobering. Of the 5000 households\nthere, 55 percent are state houses, 28 per cent privately owned (compared to about 65\npercent nationally) and 17 percent are private rental. The area has a high concentration of\nhouseholds with incomes in the $5000 to $15,000 range and very few with an income over\n$70,000. That\u2019s in sharp contrast to the more affluent suburbs like Kohimarama and St\nJohn\u2019s that surround the area.\nF. \u201cThe design is for people with different culture background,\u201d says architect James\nLunday of Common Ground which designed the 21 large family homes. \u201cArchitecturally we\ndecided to be relatively conservative \u2014 nice house in its own garden with a bit of space\nand good indoor outdoor flow.\u201d There\u2019s a slight reflection of the whare and a Pacific fale,\nbut not overplayed \u201cThe private sector is way behind in urban design and sustainable\nfutures,\u201d says Bracey. \u201cRedesigning sheets and parks is a big deal and very difficult to do.\nThe private sector won\u2019t do it, because It\u2019s so hard.\u201d\nG. There\u2019s no doubt good urban design and good architecture play a significant part in the\nscheme. But probably more important is a new standard of social control. Housing New\nZealand calls it \u201cintensive tenancy management\u201d. Others view it as social engineering. \u201cIt\u2019s\na model that we are looking at going forward,\u201d according to Housing New Zealand\u2019s central\nAuckland regional manager Graham Bodman.1 The focus is on frequent inspections,\nhelping tenants to get to know each other and trying to create an environment of respect for\nneighbours, \u201d says Bodman. That includes some strict rules \u2014 no loud parties after 10 pm,\nno dogs, no cats in the apartments, no washing hung over balcony rails and a requirement\nto mow lawns and keep the property tidy. Housing New Zealand has also been active in\norganising morning teas and sheet barbecues for residents to meet their neighbours. \u201cIVs\nall based on the intensification,\u201d says Community Renewal project manager Stuart Bracey.\n\u201cWe acknowledge if you are going to put more people living closer together, you have to\nactually help them to live closer together because it creates tension \u2014 especially for people\nthat aren\u2019t used to it.\u201d\n \n2",
