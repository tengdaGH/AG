To reproduce,\nmost flowering plants depend on a third party to transfer pollen between their male and\nfemale parts. Some require extra encouragement to give up that golden dust. The tomato\nflower, for example, needs a violent shake, a vibration roughly equivalent to 30 times the\npull of Earth\u2019s gravity, explains Arizona entomologist Stephen Buchmann. Growers have\ntried numerous ways to rattle pollen from tomato blossoms. They have used shaking\ntables, air blowers and blasts of sound. But natural means seem to work better.\n \nB It is no surprise that nature\u2019s design works best. What\u2019s astonishing is the array of\nworkers that do it: more than 200,000 individual animal species, by varying strategies, help\nthe world's 240,000 species of flowering plants make more flowers. Flies and beetles are\nthe original pollinators, going back to when flowering plants first appeared 130 million years\nago. As for bees, scientists have identified some 20,000 distinct species so far.\nHummingbirds, butterflies, moths, wasps and ants are also up to the job. Even non-flying\nmammals do their part: sugar-loving opossums, some rainforest monkeys, and lemurs in\nMadagascar, all with nimble hands that tear open flower stalks and furry coats to which\npollen sticks. Most surprising, some lizards, such as geckos, lap up nectar and pollen and\nthen transport the stuff on their faces and feet as they forage onward.\nC All that messy diversity, unfortunately, is not well suited to the monocrops and mega-\nyields of modern commercial farmers Before farms got so big, says conservation biologist\nClaire Kremen of the University of California, Berkeley, \u2018we didn\u2019t have to manage\npollinators. They were all around because of the diverse landscapes. Now you need to\nbring in an army to get pollination done. The European honeybee was first imported to the\nUS some 400 years ago.\n \nNow at least a hundred commercial crops rely almost entirely on managed honeybees,\nwhich beekeepers raise and rent out to tend to big farms. And although other species of\nbees are five to ten times more efficient, on a per-bee basis, at pollinating certain fruits,\nhoneybees have bigger colonies, cover longer distances, and tolerate management and\nmovement better than most insects. They're not picky - they\u2019ll spend their time on almost\nany crop. It\u2019s tricky to calculate what their work is truly worth; some economists put it at\nmore than $200 billion globally a year.\nD Industrial-scale farming, however, may be wearing down the system. Honeybees have\nsuffered diseases and parasite infestations for as long as they've been managed, but in\n2006 came an extreme blow.\nAround the world, bees began to disappear over the winter in massive numbers.\nBeekeepers would lift the lid of a hive and be amazed to find only the queen and a few\nstragglers, the worker bees gone.\n \nIn the US, a third to half of all hives crashed; some beekeepers reported colony losses near\n90 percent. The mysterious culprit was named colony collapse disorder (CCD) and it\nremains an annual menace - and an enigma.\nE When it first hit, many people, from agronomists to the public, assumed that our\nslathering of chemicals on agricultural fields was to blame for the mystery. Indeed, says\n \n1\n\n \nJeff Pettis of the USDA Bee Research Laboratory, \u2018we do find more disease in bees that\nhave been exposed to pesticides, even at low levels.\u2019 But it is likely that CCD involves\nmultiple stressors. Poor nutrition and chemical exposure, for instance, might wear down a\nbee's immunities before a virus finishes the insect off. It\u2019s hard to tease apart factors and\noutcomes, Pettis says. New studies reveal that fungicides - not previously thought toxic to\nbees - can interfere with microbes that break down pollen in the insects\u2019 guts, affecting\nnutrient absorption and thus long-term health and longevity. Some findings pointed to viral\nand fungal pathogens working together. \u2018I only wish we had a single agent causing all the\ndeclines,\u2019 Pettis says, \u2019that would make our work much easier!\n \nF However, habitat loss and alteration, he says, are even more of a menace to pollinators\nthan pathogens. Claire Kremen encourages farmers to cultivate the flora surrounding\nfarmland to help solve habitat problems. \u2018You can't move the farm,\u2019 she says, \u2018but you can\ndiversify what grows in its vicinity: along roads, even in tractor yards.\u2019 Planting hedgerows\nand patches of native flowers that bloom at different times and seeding fields with multiple\nplant species rather than monocrops 'not only is better for native pollinators, but it\u2019s just\nbetter agriculture,\u2019 she says. Pesticide-free wildflower havens, adds Buchmann, would also\nbolster populations of useful insects. Fortunately, too, \u2018there are far more generalist plants\nthan specialist plants, so there's a lot of redundancy in pollination,\u2019 Buchmann says. \u2018Even\nif one pollinator drops out, there are often pretty good surrogates left to do the job. The key\nto keeping our gardens growing strong, he says, is letting that diversity thrive. \nG Take away that variety, and we'll lose more than honey. \u2018We wouldn't starve,\u2019 says\nKremen. \u2018But what we eat, and even what we wear pollinators, after all, give us some of our\ncotton and flax - would be limited to crops whose pollen travels by other means. \u2018In a\nsense,\u2019 she says, \u2018our lives would be dictated by the wind. It\u2019s vital that we give pollinators\nmore of what they need and less of what they don't, and ease the burden on managed\nbees by letting native animals do their part, say scientists.\nAdapted from National Geograptiic Magazine.\n \n2",
