They invented it\nat the end of the nineteenth century in unfashionable places like New Jersey, Leeds and\nthe suburbs of Lyons. At first, they saw their clumsy new camera-projectors merely as more\nprofitable versions of Victorian lantern shows, mechanical curiosities which might have a\nuse as a sideshow at a funfair. Then the best of the pioneers looked beyond the fairground\nproperties of their invention. A few directors, now mostly forgotten, saw that the flickering\nnew medium was more than just a diversion. This crass commercial invention gradually\nbegan to evolve as an art. D W Griffith in California glimpsed its grace, German directors\nused it as an analogue to the human mind and the modernising city, Soviets emphasised\nits agitational and intellectual properties, and the Italians reconfigured it on an operatic\nscale.\nSo heady were these first decades of cinema that America and Europe can be forgiven for\nassuming that they were the only game in town. In less than twenty years western cinema\nhad grown out of all recognition; its unknowns became the most famous people in the\nworld; it made millions. It never occurred to its financial backers that another continent\nmight borrow their magic box and make it its own. But film industries were emerging in\nShanghai, Bombay and Tokyo, some of which would outgrow those in the west.\nBetween 1930 and 1935, China produced more than 500 films, mostly conventionally made\nin studios in Shanghai, without soundtracks. China's best directors - Bu Wancang and\nYuan Muzhi - introduced elements of realism to their stories. The Peach Girl (1931) and\nStreet Angel (1937) are regularly voted among the best ever made in the country.\nIndia followed a different course. In the west, the arrival of talkies gave birth to a new genre\n- the musical - but in India, every one of the 5000 films made between 1931 and the mid-\n1950s had musical interludes. The films were stylistically more wide ranging than the\nwestern musical, encompassing realism and escapist dance within individual sequences,\nand they were often three hours long rather than Hollywood's 90 minutes. The cost of such\nproductions resulted in a distinctive national style of cinema. They were often made in\nBombay, the centre of what is now known as 'Bollywood'. Performed in Hindi (rather than\nany of the numerous regional languages), they addressed social and peasant themes in an\noptimistic and romantic way and found markets in the Middle East, Africa and the Soviet\nUnion.\nIn Japan, the film industry did not rival India's in size but was unusual in other ways.\nWhereas in Hollywood the producer was the central figure, in Tokyo the director chose the\nstories and hired the producer and actors. The model was that of an artist and his studio of\napprentices. Employed by a studio as an assistant, a future director worked with senior\nfigures, learned his craft, gained authority, until promoted to director with the power to\nselect screenplays and performers. In the 1930s and 40s, this freedom of the director led to\nthe production of some of Asia's finest films.\nThe films of Kenji Mizoguchi were among the greatest of these. Mizoguchi's films were\nusually set in the nineteenth century and analysed the way in which the lives of the female\ncharacters whom he chose as his focus were constrained by the society of the time. From\nOsaka Elegy (1936) to Ugetsu Monogatari (1953) and beyond, he evolved a sinuous way\n \n1\n\nof moving his camera in and around a scene, advancing towards significant details but\noften retreating at moments of confrontation or strong feeling. No one had used the camera\nwith such finesse before.\nEven more important for film history, however, is the work of the great Ozu. Where\nHollywood cranked up drama, Ozu avoided it. His camera seldom moved. It nestled at\nseated height, framing people square on, listening quietly to their words. Ozu rejected the\nconventions of editing, cutting not on action, as is usually done in the west, but for visual\nbalance. Even more strikingly, Ozu regularly cut away from his action to a shot of a tree or\na kettle or clouds, not to establish a new location but as a moment of repose. Many\nhistorians now compare such 'pillow shots' to the Buddhist idea that mu - empty space or\nnothing - is itself an element of composition.\nAs the art form most swayed by money and market, cinema would appear to be too busy to\nbother with questions of philosophy. The Asian nations proved and are still proving that this\nis not the case. Just as deep ideas about individual freedom have led to the aspirational\ncinema of Hollywood, so it is the beliefs which underlie cultures such as those of China and\nJapan that explain the distinctiveness of Asian cinema at its best. Yes, these films are\nvisually striking, but it is their different sense of what a person is, and what space and\naction are, which makes them new to western eye.\n \n2",
