The decline of Europe's\nforests over the last decade and a half has led to an increasing awareness and\nunderstanding of the serious imbalances which threaten them. European countries are\nbecoming increasingly concerned by major threats to European forests, threats which know\nno frontiers other than those of geography or climate: air pollution, soil deterioration, the\nincreasing number of forest fires and sometimes even the mismanagement of our\nwoodland and forest heritage. There has been a growing awareness of the need for\ncountries to get together to co-ordinate their policies. In December 1990, Strasbourg\nhosted the first Ministerial Conference on the protection of Europe's forests. The\nconference brought together 31 countries from both Western and Eastern Europe. The\ntopics discussed included the co-ordinated study of the destruction of forests, as well as\nhow to combat forest fires and the extension of European research programs on the forest\necosystem. The preparatory work for the conference had been undertaken at two meetings\nof experts. Their initial task was to decide which of the many forest problems of concern to\nEurope involved the largest number of countries and might be the subject of joint\naction. Those confined to particular geographical areas, such as countries bordering the\nMediterranean or the Nordic countries therefore had to be discarded. However, this does\nnot mean that in future they will be ignored. \nAs a whole, European countries see forests as performing a triple function: biological,\neconomic and recreational. The first is to act as a 'green lung' for our planet; by means of\nphotosynthesis, forests produce oxygen through the transformation of solar energy, thus\nfulfilling what for humans is the essential role of an immense, non-polluting power plant. At\nthe same time, forests provide raw materials for human activities through their constantly\nrenewed production of wood. Finally, they offer those condemned to spend five days a\nweek in an urban environment an unrivalled area of freedom to unwind and take part in a\nrange of leisure activities, such as hunting, riding and hiking. The economic importance of\nforests has been understood since the dawn of man - wood was the first fuel. The other\naspects have been recognised only for a few centuries but they are becoming more and\nmore important. Hence, there is a real concern throughout Europe about the damage to the\nforest environment which threatens these three basic roles.\nThe myth of the 'natural' forest has survived, yet there are effectively no remaining 'primary'\nforests in Europe. All European forests are artificial, having been adapted and exploited by\nman for thousands of years. This means that a forest policy is vital, that it must transcend\nnational frontiers and generations of people, and that it must allow for the inevitable\nchanges that take place in the forests, in needs, and hence in policy. The Strasbourg\nconference was one of the first events on such a scale to reach this conclusion. A general\ndeclaration was made that 'a central place in any ecologically coherent forest policy must\nbe given to continuity over time and to the possible effects of unforeseen events, to ensure\nthat the full potential of these forests is maintained'.\nThat general declaration was accompanied by six detailed resolutions to assist national\npolicymaking. The first proposes the extension and systematisation of surveillance sites to\nmonitor forest decline. Forest decline is still poorly understood but leads to the loss of a\nhigh proportion of a tree's needles or leaves. The entire continent and the majority of\nspecies are now affected: between 30% and 50% of the tree population. The condition\n \n1\n\nappears to result from the cumulative effect of a number of factors, with atmospheric\npollutants the principal culprits. Compounds of nitrogen and sulphur dioxide should be\nparticularly closely watched. However, their effects are probably accentuated by climatic\nfactors, such as drought and hard winters, or soil imbalances such as soil acidification,\nwhich damages the roots. The second resolution concentrates on the need to preserve the\ngenetic diversity of European forests. The aim is to reverse the decline in the number of\ntree species or at least to preserve the 'genetic material' of all of them. Although forest fires\ndo not affect all of Europe to the same extent, the amount of damage caused the experts to\npropose as the third resolution that the Strasbourg conference consider the establishment\nof a European databank on the subject. All information used in the development of national\npreventative policies would become generally available. The subject of the fourth resolution\ndiscussed by the ministers was mountain forests. In Europe, it is undoubtedly the mountain\necosystem which has changed most rapidly and is most at risk. A thinly scattered\npermanent population and development of leisure activities, particularly skiing, have\nresulted in significant long-term changes to the local ecosystems. Proposed developments\ninclude a preferential research program on mountain forests. The fifth\nresolution relaunched the European research network on the physiology of trees, called\nEurosilva. Eurosilva should support joint European research on tree diseases and their\nphysiological and biochemical aspects. Each country concerned could increase the number\nof scholarships and other financial support for doctoral theses and research projects in this\narea. Finally, the conference established the framework for a European research network\non forest ecosystems. This would also involve harmonising activities in individual countries\nas well as identifying a number of priority research topics relating to the protection of\nforests. The Strasbourg conference's main concern was to provide for the future. This was\nthe initial motivation, one now shared by all 31 participants representing 31 European\ncountries. Their final text commits them to on-going discussion between\ngovernment representatives with responsibility for forests.\n \n2",
