Ancient Egyptian physicians used\nextracts from the willow tree as an analgesic, or pain killer. Centuries later the Greek\nphysician Hippocrates recommended the bark of the willow tree as a remedy for the pains\nof childbirth and as a fever reducer. But it wasn't until the eighteenth and nineteenth\ncenturies that salicylates the chemical found in the willow tree became the subject of\nserious scientific investigation. The race was on to identify the active ingredient and to\nreplicate it synthetically. At the end of the nineteenth century a German company, Friedrich\nBayer & Co. succeeded in creating a relatively safe and very effective chemical compound,\nacetylsalicylic acid, which was renamed aspirin.\nThe late nineteenth century was a fertile period for experimentation, partly because of the\nhunger among scientists to answer some of the great scientific questions, but also because\nthose questions were within their means to answer. One scientist in a laboratory with some\nchemicals and a test tube could make significant breakthroughs whereas today, in order to\nmap the human genome for instance, one needs \u2018an army of researchers, a bank of\ncomputers and millions and millions of dollars\u2019.\nBut an understanding of the nature of science and scientific inquiry is not enough on its\nown to explain how society innovates. In the nineteenth century, scientific advance was\nclosely linked to the industrial revolution. This was a period when people frequently had the\nmeans, motive and determination to take an idea and turn it into reality. In the case of\naspirin that happened piecemeal - a series of minor, often unrelated advances, fertilised by\nthe century\u2019s broader economic, medical and scientific developments, that led to one big\nfinal breakthrough.\nThe link between big money and pharmaceutical innovation is also a significant one.\nAspirin s continued shelf life was ensured because for the first 70 years of its life, huge\namounts of money were put into promoting it as an ordinary everyday analgesic. In the\n1070s other analgesics, such as ibuprofen and paracetamol, were entering the market, and\nthe pharmaceutical companies then focused on publicising these new drugs. But just at the\nsame time, discoveries were made regarding the beneficial role of aspirin in preventing\nheart attacks, strokes and other afflictions. Had it not been for these findings, this\npharmaceutical marvel may well have disappeared.\nSo the relationship between big money and drugs is an odd one. Commercial markets are\nnecessary for developing new products and ensuring that they remain around long enough\nfor scientists to carry out research on them. Rut the commercial markets are just as likely to\nkill off' certain products when something more attractive comes along. In the case of\naspirin, a potential \u2018wonder drug* was around for over 70 years without anybody\ninvestigating the way in which it achieved its effects, because they were making more than\n \n1\n\nenough money out of it as it was. If ibuprofen or paracetamol had entered the market just a\ndecade earlier, aspirin might then not be here today. It would be just another forgotten drug\nthat people hadn't bothered to explore.\nNone of the recent discoveries of aspirin's benefits were made by the big pharmaceutical\ncompanies; they were made by scientists working in the public sector. 'The reason for that\nis very simple and straightforward,' Jeffreys says in his book. 'Drug companies will only\npursue research that is going to deliver financial benefits. There's no profit in aspirin any\nmore. It is incredibly inexpensive with tiny profit margins and it has no patent any more, so\nanyone can produce it.' In fact, there's almost a disincentive for drug companies to further\nboost the drug, he argues, as it could possibly put them out of business by stopping them\nfrom selling their more expensive brands.\nSo what is the solution to a lack of commercial interest in further exploring the therapeutic\nbenefits of aspirin? More public money going into clinical trials, says Jeffreys. \u2018If I were the\nDepartment of Health. I would say \u201cthis is a very inexpensive drug. There may be a lot of\nother things we could do with it.\" We should put a lot more money into trying to find out.'\n \nJeffreys' book which not only tells the tale of a 'wonder drug' but also explores the nature of\ninnovation and the role of big business, public money and regulation reminds us why such\nresearch is so important.\n \n2",
