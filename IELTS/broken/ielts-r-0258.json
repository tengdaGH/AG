    "passage_text": "Reading Practice\n \nLife code: unlocked!\n \n{A} On an airport shuttle bus to the Kavli Institute for Theoretical Physics in Santa Barbara,\nCalif., Chris Wiggins took a colleague\u2019s advice and opened a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet.\nIt had nothing to do with the talk on biopolymer physics he was invited to give. Rather the\ncolumns and rows of numbers that stared back at him referred to the genetic activity of\nbudding yeast. Specifically, the numbers represented the amount of messenger RNA\n(MRNA) expressed by all 6,200 genes of the yeast over the course of its reproductive\ncycle. \u201cIt was the first time I ever saw anything like this,\u201d Wiggins recalls of that spring day\nin 2002. \u201cHow to make sense of all this data?\u201d \n{B} Instead of shirking from this question, the 36-year-old applied mathematician and\nphysicist at Columbia University embraced it-and now six years later he thinks he has an\nanswer. By foraying into fields outside his own, Wiggins has drudged up tools from a\nbranch of artificial intelligence called machine learning to model the collective protein-\nmaking activity of genes from real-world biological data. Engineers originally designed\nthese tools in the late 1950s to predict output from input. Wiggins and his colleagues have\nnow brought machine learning to the natural sciences and tweaked it so that it can also tell\na story-one not only about input and output but also about what happens inside a model of\ngene regulation, the black box in between. \n{C} The impetus for this work began in the late 1990s, when high-throughput techniques\ngenerated more mRNA expression profiles and DNA sequences than ever before, \u201copening\nup a completely different way of thinking about biological phenomena,\u201d Wiggins says. Key\namong these techniques were DNA microarrays, chips that provide a panoramic view of\nthe activity of genes and their expression levels in any cell type, simultaneously and under\nmyriad conditions. As noisy and incomplete as the data were, biologists could now query\nwhich genes turn on or off in different cells and determine the collection of proteins that\ngive rise to a cell\u2019s characteristic features, healthy or diseased. \n \n{D} Yet predicting such gene activity requires uncovering the fundamental rules that govern\nit. \u201cOver time, these rules have been locked in by cells,\u201d says theoretical physicist Harmen\nBussemaker, now an associate professor of biology at Columbia. \u201cEvolution has kept the\ngood stuff.\u201d To find these rules, scientists needed statistics to infer the interaction between\ngenes and the proteins that regulate them and to then mathematically describe this\nnetwork\u2019s underlying structure-the dynamic pattern of gene and protein activity over time.\nBut physicists who did not work with particles (or planets, for that matter) viewed statistics\nas nothing short of an anathema. \u201cIf your experiment requires statistics,\u201d British physicist\nErnest Rutherford once said, \u201cyou ought to have done a better experiment.\u201d \n{E} But in working with microarrays, \u201cthe experiment has been done without you,\u201d Wiggins\nexplains. \u201cAnd biology doesn\u2019t hand you a model to make sense of the data.\u201d Even more\nchallenging, the building blocks that makeup DNA, RNA, and proteins are assembled in\nmyriad ways; moreover, subtly different rules of interaction govern their activity, making it\ndifficult, if not impossible, to reduce their patterns of interaction to fundamental laws. Some\ngenes and proteins are not even known. \u201cYou are trying to find something compelling about\nthe natural world in a context where you don\u2019t know very much,\u201d says William Bialek, a\n \n1\n\nbiophysicist at Princeton University. \u201cYou\u2019re forced to be agnostic.\u201d Wiggins believes that\nmany machine-learning algorithms perform well under precisely these conditions. When\nworking with so many unknown variables, \u201cmachine learning lets the data decide what\u2019s\nworth looking at,\u201d he says. \n \n{F} At the Kavli Institute, Wiggins began building a model of a gene regulatory network in a\nyeast-the set of rules by which genes selectively orchestrate how vigorously DNA is\ntranscribed into mRNA. As he worked with different algorithms, he started to attend\ndiscussions on gene regulation led by Christina Leslie, who ran the computational biology\ngroup at Columbia at the time. Leslie suggested using a specific machine-learning tool\ncalled a classifier. Say the algorithm must discriminate between pictures that have bicycles\nin them and pictures that do not. A classifier sifts through labeled examples and measures\neverything it can about them, gradually learning the decision rules that govern the\ngrouping. From these rules, the algorithm generates a model that can determine whether or\nnot new pictures have bikes in them. In gene regulatory networks, the learning task\nbecomes the problem of predicting whether genes increase or decrease their protein-\nmaking activity.\n{G} The algorithm that Wiggins and Leslie began building in the fall of 2002 was trained on\nthe DNA sequences and mRNA levels of regulators expressed during a range of conditions\nin yeast-when the yeast was cold, hot, starved, and so on. Specifically, this algorithm-\nMEDUSA (for motif element discrimination using sequence agglomeration) -scans every\npossible pairing between a set of DNA promoter sequences, called motifs, and regulators.\nThen, much like a child might match a list of words with their definitions by drawing a line\nbetween the two, MEDUSA finds the pairing that best improves the fit between the model\nand the data it tries to emulate. (Wiggins refers to these pairings as edges.) Each time\nMEDUSA finds a pairing, it updates the model by adding a new rule to guide its search for\nthe next pairing. It then determines the strength of each pairing by how well the rule\nimproves the existing model. The hierarchy of numbers enables Wiggins and his\ncolleagues to determine which pairings are more important than others and how they can\ncollectively influence the activity of each of the yeast\u2019s 6,200 genes. By adding one pairing\nat a time, MEDUSA can predict which genes ratchet up their RNA production or clamp that\nproduction down, as well as reveal the collective mechanisms that orchestrate an\norganism\u2019s transcriptional logic. \n \n2",
