    "passage_text": "Reading Practice\n \nEnvironmental Management\nSection A\nThe role of governments in environmental management is difficult but inescapable.\nSometimes, the state tries to manage the resources it owns, and does so badly. Often,\nhowever, governments act in an even more harmful way. They actually subsidise the\nexploitation and consumption of natural resources. A whole range of policies, from farm-\nprice support to protection for coal-mining, do environmental damage and (often) make no\neconomic sense. Scrapping them offers a two-fold bonus: a cleaner environment and a\nmore efficient economy. Growth and environmentalism can actually go hand in hand, if\npoliticians have the courage to confront the vested interest that subsidies create.\nSection B\nNo activity affects more of the earth's surface than farming. It shapes a third of the planet's\nland area, not counting Antarctica, and the proportion Is rising. World food output per head\nhas risen by 4 per cent between the 1970s and 1980s mainly as a result of increases in\nyields from land already in cultivation, but also because more land has been brought under\nthe plough. Higher yields have been achieved by increased irrigation, better crop breeding,\nand a doubling in the use of pesticides and chemical fertilisers in the 1970s and 1980s.\nSection C\nAll these activities may have damaging environmental impacts. For example, land clearing\nfor agriculture is the largest single cause of deforestation; chemical fertilisers and\npesticides may contaminate water supplies; more intensive farming and the abandonment\nof fallow periods tend to exacerbate soil erosion; and the spread of mono-Culture and use\nof high-yielding varieties of crops have been accompanied by the disappearance of old\nvarieties of food plants which might have provided some insurance against pests or\ndiseases in future. Soil erosion threatens the productivity of land In both rich and poor\ncountries. The United States, where the most careful measurements have been done,\ndiscovered in 1982 that about one-fifth of its farmtand as losing topsoil at a rate likely to\ndiminish the soil's productivity. The country subsequently embarked upon a program to\nconvert 11 per cent of its cropped land to meadow or forest. Topsoil in India and China is\nvanishing much faster than in America.\nSection D\nGovernment policies have frequently compounded the environmental damage that farming\ncan cause. In the rich countries, subsidies for growing crops and price supports for farm\noutput drive up the price of land.The annual value of these subsidies is immense: about\n$250 billion, or more than all World Bank lending in the 1980s.To increase the output of\ncrops per acre, a farmer's easiest option is to use more of the most readily available inputs:\nfertilisers and pesticides. Fertiliser use doubled in Denmark in the period 1960-1985 and\nincreased in The Netherlands by 150 per cent. The quantity of pesticides applied has risen\ntoo; by 69 per cent In 1975-1984 in Denmark, for example, with a rise of 115 per cent in the\nfrequency of application in the three years from 1981.\nIn the late 1980s and early 1990s some efforts were made to reduce farm subsidies. The\nmost dramatic example was that of New Zealand, which scrapped most farm support in\n \n1\n\n1984. A study of the environmental effects, conducted in 1993, found that the end of\nfertiliser subsidies had been followed by a fall in fertiliser use (a fall compounded by the\ndecline in world commodity prices, which cut farm incomes). The removal of subsidies also\nstopped land-clearing and over-stocking, which in the past had been the principal causes of\nerosion. Farms began to diversify. The one kind of subsidy whose removal appeared to\nhave been bad for the environment was the subsidy to manage soil eroslon,\nIn less enlightened countries, and in the European Union, the trend has been to reduce\nrather than eliminate subsidies, and to introduce new payments to encourage farmers to\ntreat their land In environmentally friendlier ways, or to leave it follow. It may sound strange\nbut such payments need to be higher than the existing incentives for farmers to grow food\ncrops. Farmers, however, dislike being paid to do nothing. In several countries they have\nbecome interested in the possibility of using fuel produced from crop residues either as a\nreplacement for petrol (as ethanol) or as fuel for power stations (as biomass). Such fuels\nproduce far less carbon dioxide than coal or oil, and absorb carbon dioxide as they\ngrow.They are therefore less likely to contribute to the greenhouse effect. But they die\nrarely competitive with fossil fuels unless subsidised - and growing them does no less\nenvironmental harm than other crops.\nSection E\nIn poor countries, governments aggravate other sorts of damage. Subsidies for pesticides\nand artificial fertilisers encourage farmers to use greater quantities than are needed to get\nthe highest economic crop yield. A study by the International Rice Research Institute Of\npesticide use by farmers in South East Asia found that, with pest-resistant varieties of rice,\neven moderate applications of pesticide frequently cost farmers more than they\nsaved.Such waste puts farmers on a chemical treadmill: bugs and weeds become resis-\ntant to poisons, so next year's poisons must be more lethal. One cost is to human health,\nEvery year some 10,000 people die from pesticide poisoning, almost all of them in the\ndeveloping countries, and another 400,000 become seriously ill. As for artificial fertilisers,\ntheir use world-wide increased by 40 per cent per unit of farmed land between the mid\n1970s and late 1980s, mostly in the developing countries. Overuse of fertilisers may cause\nfarmers to stop rotating crops or leaving their land fallow. That, In turn, may make soil\nerosion worse.\nSection F\n \nA result of the Uruguay Round of world trade negotiations Is likely to be a reduction of 36\nper cent In the average levels of farm subsidies paid by the rich countries in 1986-1990.\nSome of the world's food production will move from Western Europe to regions where\nsubsidies are lower or non-existent, such as the former communist countries and parts of\nthe developing world. Some environmentalists worry about this outcome. It will undoubtedly\nmean more pressure to convert natural habitat into farmland. But it will also have many\ndesirable environmental effects. The intensity of farming in the rich world should decline,\nand the use of chemical inputs will diminish. Crops are more likely to be grown p the\nenvironments to which they are naturally suited. And more farmers in poor countries wilt\nhave the money and the incentive to manage their land in ways that are sustainable in the\nlong run. That is important. To feed an increasingly hungry world, farmers need every\nincentive to use their soil and water effectively and efficiently.\n \n2",
