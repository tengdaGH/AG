The aim is to show that they care about the\nenvironment and about people's health.But is this the right approach?\n  \nA\nEurope is now the biggest market for organic food in the world, expanding by 25 percent a\nyear over the past 10 years. So what is the attraction of organic food for some people? The\nreally important thing is that organic sounds more \u2018natural\u2019. Eating organic is a way of\ndefining oneself as natural, good, caring, different from the junk-food-scoffing masses. As\none journalist puts it: It feels closer to the source, the beginning, the start of things.' The\nreal desire is to be somehow close to the soil, to Mother Nature.\nB\nUnlike conventional farming, the organic approach means farming with natural, rather than\nman-made, fertilisers and pesticides. Techniques such as crop rotation improve soil quality\nand help organic farmers compensate for the absence of man-made chemicals. As a\nmethod of food production, organic is, however, inefficient in its use of labour and land;\nthere are severe limits to how much food can be produced. Also, the environmental\nbenefits of not using artificial fertiliser are tiny compared with the amount of carbon dioxide\nemitted by transporting food (a great deal of Britain\u2019s organic produce is shipped in from\nother countries and transported from shop to home by car).\nC\nOrganic farming is often claimed to be safer than conventional farming - for the\nenvironment and for consumers. Yet studies into organic farming worldwide continue to\nreject this claim. An extensive review by the UK Food Standards Agency found that there\nwas no statistically significant difference between organic and conventional crops. Even\nwhere results indicated there was evidence of a difference, the reviewers found no sign\nthat these differences would have any noticeable effect on health.\nD\nThe simplistic claim that organic food is more nutritious than conventional food was always\nlikely to be misleading. Food is a natural product, and the health value of different foods will\nvary for a number of reasons, including freshness, the way the food is cooked, the type of\nsoil it is grown in, the amount of sunlight and rain crops have received, and so on.\nLikewise, the flavour of a carrot has less to do with whether it was fertilised with manure or\nsomething out of a plastic sack than with the variety of carrot and how long ago it was dug\nup. The differences created by these things are likely to be greater than any differences\nbrought about by using an organic or nonorganic system of production. Indeed, even some\n\u2018organic\u2019 farms are quite different from one another.\nE\nThe notion that organic food is safer than \u2018normal\u2019 food is also contradicted by the fact that\nmany of our most common foods are full of natural toxins. Parsnips cause blisters on the\n \n1\n\nskin of agricultural workers. Toasting bread creates carcinogens. As one research expert\nsays: \u2018People think that the more natural something is, the better it is for them. That is\nsimply not the case. In fact, it is the opposite that is true: the closer a plant is to its natural\nstate, the more likely it is that it wiil poison you. Naturally, many plants do not want to be\neaten, so we have spent 10,000 years developing agriculture and breeding out harmful\ntraits from crops.'\nF\nYet educated Europeans are more scared of eating traces of a few, strictly regulated, man-\nmade chemicals than they are of eating the ones that nature created directly. Surrounded\nby plentiful food, it\u2019s not nature they worry about, but technology. Our obsessions with the\nethics and safety of what we eat - concerns about antibiotics in animals, additives in food,\nGM crops and so on - are symptomatic of a highly technological society that has little faith\nin its ability to use this technology wisely. In this context, the less something is touched by\nthe human hand, the healthier people assume it must be.\nG\nUltimately, the organic farming movement is an expensive luxury for shoppers in well-\nmanicured Europe. For developing parts of the world, it is irrelevant. To European\nenvironmentalists, the fact that organic methods require more labour and land than\nconventional ones to get the same yields is a good thing; to a farmer in rural Africa, it is a\ndisaster. Here, land tends to be so starved and crop yields so low that there simply is not\nenough organic matter to put back into the soil.
