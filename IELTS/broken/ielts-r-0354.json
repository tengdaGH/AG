For example, one graphic illustration to which children might\nreadily relate is the estimate that rainforests are being destroyed at a rate equivalent to one\nthousand football fields every forty minutes - about the duration of a normal classroom\nperiod. In the face of the frequent and often vivid media coverage, it is likely that children\nwill have formed ideas about rainforests - what and where they are, why they are important,\nwhat endangers them - independent of any formal tuition. It is also possible that some of\nthese ideas will be mistaken.\nMany studies have shown that children harbour misconceptions about \u2018pure\u2019, curriculum\nscience. These misconceptions do not remain isolated but become incorporated into a\nmultifaceted, but organised, conceptual framework, making it and the component ideas,\nsome of which are erroneous, more robust but also accessible to modification. These ideas\nmay be developed by children absorbing ideas through the popular media. Sometimes this\ninformation may be erroneous. It seems schools may not be providing an opportunity for\nchildren to re-express their ideas and so have them tested and refined by teachers and\ntheir peers.\nDespite the extensive coverage in the popular media of the destruction of rainforests, little\nformal information is available about children\u2019s ideas in this area. The aim of the present\nstudy is to start to provide such information, to help teachers design their educational\nstrategies to build upon correct ideas and to displace misconceptions and to plan\nprogrammes in environmental studies in their schools.\nThe study surveys children\u2019s scientific knowledge and attitudes to rainforests. Secondary\nschool children were asked to complete a questionnaire containing five open-form\nquestions. The most frequent responses to the first question were descriptions which are\nself-evident from the term \u2018rainforest\u2019. Some children described them as damp, wet or hot.\nThe second question concerned the geographical location of rainforests. The commonest\nresponses were continents or countries: Africa (given by 43% of children), South America\n(30%), Brazil (25%). Some children also gave more general locations, such as being near\nthe Equator. \nResponses to question three concerned the importance of rainforests. The dominant idea,\nraised by 64% of the pupils, was that rainforests provide animals with habitats. Fewer\nstudents responded that rainforests provide plant habitats, and even fewer mentioned the\nindigenous populations of rainforests. More girls (70%) than boys (60%) raised the idea of\nrainforest as animal habitats.\nSimilarly, but at a lower level, more girls (13%) than boys (5%) said that rainforests\nprovided human habitats. These observations are generally consistent with our previous\nstudies of pupils\u2019 views about the use and conservation of rainforests, in which girls were\nshown to be more sympathetic to animals and expressed views which seem to place an\nintrinsic value on non-human animal life.\nThe fourth question concerned the causes of the destruction of rainforests. Perhaps\nencouragingly, more than half of the pupils (59%) identified that it is human activities which\nare destroying rainforests, some personalising the responsibility by the use of terms such\n \n1\n\nas \u2018we are\u2019. About 18% of the pupils referred specifically to logging activity.\nOne misconception, expressed by some 10% of the pupils, was that acid rain is\nresponsible for rainforest destruction; a similar proportion said that pollution is destroying\nrainforests. Here, children are confusing rainforest destruction with damage to the forests\nof Western Europe by these factors. While two fifths of the students provided the\ninformation that the rainforests provide oxygen, in some cases this response also\nembraced the misconception that rainforest destruction would reduce atmospheric oxygen,\nmaking the atmosphere incompatible with human life on Earth.\nIn answer to the final question about the importance of rainforest conservation, the majority\nof children simply said that we need rainforests to survive. Only a few of the pupils (6%)\nmentioned that rainforest destruction may contribute to global warming. This is surprising\nconsidering the high level of media coverage on this issue. Some children expressed the\nidea that the conservation of rainforests is not important.\nThe results of this study suggest that certain ideas predominate in the thinking of children\nabout rainforests. Pupils\u2019 responses indicate some misconceptions in basic scientific\nknowledge of rainforests\u2019 ecosystems such as their ideas about rainforests as habitats for\nanimals, plants and humans and the relationship between climatic change and destruction\nof rainforests.\n \nPupils did not volunteer ideas that suggested that they appreciated the complexity of\ncauses of rainforest destruction. In other words, they gave no indication of an appreciation\nof either the range of ways in which rainforests are important or the complex social,\neconomic and political factors which drive the activities which are destroying the\nrainforests. One encouragement is that the results of similar studies about other\nenvironmental issues suggest that older children seem to acquire the ability to appreciate,\nvalue and evaluate conflicting views. Environmental education offers an arena in which\nthese skills can be developed, which is essential for these children as future decision-\nmakers.\n \n2",
