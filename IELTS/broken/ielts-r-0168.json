In the last ten years advertising for fast food, outlets\nhave rapidly increased. There is some evidence that the dominance of television has\nrecently begun to wane. The importance of strong, global branding reinforces a need for\nmulti-faceted communications combining television with merchandising, \u2018tie-ins\u2019 and point\nof sale activity. The advertised diet contrasts sharply with that recommended by public\nhealth advisors, and themes of fun and fantasy or taste, rather than health and nutrition,\nare used to promote it to children. Meanwhile, the recommended diet gets little promotional\nsupport.\nB\nThere is plenty of evidence that children notice and enjoy food promotion. However,\nestablishing whether this actually influences them is a complex problem. The review\ntackled it by looking at studies that had examined possible effects on what children know\nabout food, their food preferences, their actual food behaviour (both buying and eating),\nand their health outcomes (eg. Obesity or cholesterol levels). The majority of studies\nexamined food advertising, but a few examined other forms of food promotion. In terms of\nnutritional knowledge, food advertising seems to have little influence on children\u2019s general\nperceptions of what constitutes a healthy diet, but, in certain contexts, it does have an\neffect on more specific types of nutritional knowledge. For example, seeing soft drink and\ncereal adverts reduced primary aged children\u2019s ability to determine correctly whether or not\ncertain products contained real fruit.\nC\nThe review also found evidence that food promotion influences children\u2019s food preferences\nand purchase behaviour. A study of primary school children, for instance, found that\nexposure to advertising influenced which foods they claimed to like; and another showed\nthat labelling and signage on a vending machine had an effect on what was bought by\nsecondary school pupils. A number of studies have also shown that food advertising can\ninfluence what children eat. One, for example, showed that advertising influenced a primary\nclass\u2019s choice of daily snack at playtime.\nD\n \n1\n\nThe next step, of trying to establish whether or not a link exists between food promotion\nand diet or obesity, is extremely difficult as it requires research to be done in real-world\nsettings. A number of studies have attempted this by using the amount of television viewing\nas a proxy for exposure to television advertising. They have established a clear link\nbetween television viewing and diet, obesity, and cholesterol levels. It is impossible to say,\nhowever, whether this effect is caused by the advertising, the sedentary nature of television\nviewing or snacking that might take place whilst viewing. One study resolved this problem\nby taking a detailed diary of children\u2019s viewing habits. This showed that the more food\nadverts they saw, the more snacks and calories they consumed.\nE\nThus the literature does suggest food promotion is influencing children\u2019s diet in a number of\nways. This does not amount to proof; as noted above with this kind of research,\nincontrovertible proof simply isn\u2019t attainable. Nor do all studies point to this conclusion;\nseveral have not found an effect. In addition, very few studies have attempted to measure\nhow strong these effects are relative to other factors influencing children\u2019s food choices.\nNonetheless, many studies have found clear effects and they have used sophisticated\nmethodologies that make it possible to determine that i) these effects are not just due to\nchance; ii) they are independent of other factors that influence diets, such as parents\u2019\neating habits or attitudes; and iii) they occur at a brand and category level.\nF\nFurthermore, two factors suggest that these findings actually downplay the effect that food\npromotion has on children. First, the literature focuses principally on television advertising;\nthe cumulative effect of this combined with other forms of promotion and marketing is likely\nto be significantly greater. Second, the studies have looked at the direct effects of individual\nchildren, and understate indirect influences. For example, promotion for fast food outlets\nmay not only influence the child but also encourage parents to take them for meals and\nreinforce the idea that this is normal and desirable behaviour.\nG\nThis does not amount to proof of an effect, but in our view does provide sufficient evidence\nto conclude that an effect exists. The debate should now shift to what action is needed, and\nspecifically to how the power of commercial marketing can be used to bring about\nimprovements in young people\u2019s eating.\n \n2",
