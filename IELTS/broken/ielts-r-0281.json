    "passage_text": "Reading Practice\n \nMeasures to combat infectious disease in tsarist Russia\n \nA In the second half of the seventeenth century, Russian authorities began\nimplementing controls at the borders of their empire to prevent the importation of\nplague, a highly infectious and dangerous disease. Information on disease outbreak\noccurring abroad was regularly reported to the tsar\u2019s court through various means,\nincluding commercial channels (travelling merchants), military personnel deployed\nabroad, undercover agents, the network of Imperial Foreign Office embassies and\nrepresentations abroad, and the customs offices. For instance, the heads of\ncustoms offices were instructed to question foreigners entering Russia about\npossible epidemics of dangerous diseases in their respective countries.\nB If news of an outbreak came from abroad, relations with the affected country were\nsuspended. For instance, foreign vessels were not allowed to dock in Russian ports\nif there was credible information about the existence of epidemics in countries from\nwhence they had departed. In addition, all foreigners entering Russia from those\ncountries had to undergo quarantine. In 1665, after receiving news about a plague\nepidemic in England, Tsar Alexei wrote a letter to King Charles II in which he\nannounced the cessation of Russian trade relations with England and other foreign\nstates. These protective measures appeared to have been effective, as the country\ndid not record any cases of plague during that year and in the next three decades. It\nwas not until 1692 that another plague outbreak was recorded in the Russian\nprovince of Astrakhan. This epidemic continued for five months and killed 10,383\npeople, or about 65 percent of the city\u2019s population. By the end of the seventeenth\ncentury, preventative measures had been widely introduced in Russia, including the\nisolation of persons ill with plague, the imposition of quarantines, and the\ndistribution of explanatory public health notices about plague outbreaks.\nC During the eighteenth century, although none of the occurrences was of the same\nscale as in the past, plague appeared in Russia several times. For instance, from\n1703 to 1705, a plague outbreak that had ravaged Istanbul spread to the Podolsk and\nKiev provinces in Russia, and then to Poland and Hungary. After defeating the\nSwedes in the battle of Poltava in 1709, Tsar Peter I (Peter the Great) dispatched part\nof his army to Poland, where plague had been raging for two years. Despite\npreventive measures, the disease spread among the Russian troops. In 1710, the\nplague reached Riga (then part of Sweden, now the capital of Latvia), where it was\nactive until 1711 and claimed 60,000 lives. During this period, the Russians besieged\nRiga and, after the Swedes had surrendered the city in 1710, the Russian army lost\n9.800 soldiers to the plague. Russian military chronicles of the time note that more\nsoldiers died of the disease after the capture of Riga than from enemy fire during the\nsiege of that city.\nD Tsar Peter I imposed strict measures to prevent the spread of plague during these\nconflicts. Soldiers suspected of being infected were isolated and taken to areas far\nfrom military camps. In addition, camps were designed to separate divisions,\ndetachments, and smaller units of soldiers. When plague reached Narva (located in\npresent-day Estonia) and threatened to spread to St. Petersburg, the newly built\ncapital of Russia, Tsar Peter I ordered the army to cordon off the entire boundary\nalong the Luga River, including temporarily halting all activity on the river.\n \n1\n\n \nIn order to prevent the movement of people and goods from Narva to St Petersburg and\nNovgorod, roadblocks and checkpoints were set up on all roads. The tsar\u2019s orders were\nrigorously enforced, and those who disobeyed were hung.\n \nE However, although the Russian authorities applied such methods to contain the\nspread of the disease and limit the number of victims, all of the measures had a\nprovisional character: they were intended to respond to a specific outbreak, and\nwere not designed as a coherent set of measures to be implemented systematically\nat the first sign of plague. The advent of such a standard response system came a\nfew years later.\nF The first attempts to organise procedures and carry out proactive steps to control\nplague date to the aftermath of the 1727- 1728 epidemic in Astrakhan. In response to\nthis, the Russian imperial authorities issued several decrees aimed at controlling the\nfuture spread of plague. Among these decrees, the \u2018Instructions for Governors and\nHeads of Townships\u2019 required that all governors immediately inform the Senate - a\ngovernment body created by Tsar Peter I in 1711 to advise the monarch - if plague\ncases were detected in their respective provinces.\nFurthermore, the decree required that governors ensure the physical examination of all\npersons suspected of carrying the disease and their subsequent isolation. In addition, it\nwas ordered that sites where plague victims were found had to be encircled by checkpoints\nand isolated for the duration of the outbreak. These checkpoints were to remain operational\nfor at least six weeks.\n \nThe houses of infected persons were to be burned along with all of the personal property\nthey contained, including farm animals and cattle. The governors were instructed to inform\nthe neighbouring provinces and cities about every plague case occurring on their territories.\nFinally, letters brought by couriers were heated above a fire before being copied.\nG The implementation by the authorities of these combined measures demonstrates\ntheir intuitive understanding of the importance of the timely isolation of infected\npeople to limit the spread of plague.\n \n2",
