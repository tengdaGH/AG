We knew that summer 2003 was remarkable: Britain experienced its\nrecord high temperature and continental Europe saw forest fires raging out of control, great\nrivers drying to a trickle and thousands of heat-related deaths. But just how remarkable is\nonly now becoming clear.\n \nThe three months of June, July and August were the warmest ever recorded in western\nand central Europe, with record national highs in Portugal, Germany and Switzerland as\nwell as in Britain. And they were the warmest by a very long way. Over a great rectangular\nblock of the earth stretching from west of Paris to northern Italy, taking in Switzerland and\nsouthern Germany, the average temperature for the summer months was 3.78\u00b0C above\nthe long-term norm, said the Climatic Research Unit (CRU) of the University of East Anglia\nin Norwich, which is one of the world's leading institutions for the monitoring and analysis of\ntemperature records.\n \nThat excess might not seem a lot until you are aware of the context - but then you realise it\nis enormous. There is nothing like this in previous data, anywhere. It is considered so\nexceptional that Professor Phil Jones, the CRU's director, is prepared to say openly - in a\nway few scientists have done before - that the 2003 extreme may be directly attributed, not\nto natural climate variability, but to global warming caused by human actions.\n \n \nMeteorologists have hitherto contented themselves with the formula that recent high\ntemperatures are \u201cconsistent with predictions\u201d of climate change. For the great block of the\nmap - that stretching between 35-50N and 0-20E - the CRU has reliable temperature\nrecords dating back to 1781. Using as a baseline the average summer temperature\nrecorded between 1961 and 1990, departures from the temperature norm, or \u201canomalies\u201d,\nover the area as a whole can easily be plotted. As the graph shows, such is the variability\nof our climate that over the past 200 years, there have been at least half a dozen\nanomalies, in terms of excess temperature - the peaks on the graph denoting very hot\nyears - approaching, or even exceeding, 2\u00b0C. But there has been nothing remotely like\n2003, when the anomaly is nearly four degrees.\n \n\u201cThis is quite remarkable,\u2019 Professor Jones told The Independent. \u201cIt\u2019s very unusual in a\nstatistical sense. If this series had a normal statistical distribution, you wouldn\u2019t get this\nnumber. The return period [how often it could be expected to recur] would be something\nlike one in a thousand years. If we look at an excess above the average of nearly four\ndegrees, then perhaps nearly three degrees of that is natural variability, because we\u2019ve\nseen that in past summers. But the final degree of it is likely to be due to global warming,\ncaused by human actions.\u201d\nThe summer of 2003 has, in a sense, been one that climate scientists have long been\nexpecting. Until now, the warming has been manifesting itself mainly in winters that have\nbeen less cold than in summers that have been much hotter. Last week, the United Nations\npredicted that winters were warming so quickly that winter sports would die out in Europe\u2019s\n \n1\n\n \nlower-level ski resorts. But sooner or later, the unprecedented hot summer was bound to\ncome, and this year it did.\n \nOne of the most dramatic features of the summer was the hot nights, especially in the first\nhalf of August. In Paris, the temperature never dropped below 23\u00b0C (73.4\u00b0F) at all between\n7 and 14 August, and the city recorded its warmest-ever night on 11-12 August, when the\nmercury did not drop below 25.5\u00b0C (77.9\u00b0F). Germany recorded its warmest-ever night at\nWeinbiet in the Rhine Valley with a lowest figure of 27.6\u00b0C (80.6\u00b0F) on 13 August, and\nsimilar record-breaking nighttime temperatures were recorded in Switzerland and Italy.\n \nThe 15,000 excess deaths in France during August, compared with previous years, have\nbeen related to the high night-time temperatures. The number gradually increased during\nthe first 12 days of the month, peaking at about 2,000 per day on the night of 12-13 August,\nthen fell off dramatically after 14 August when the minimum temperatures fell by about 5\u00b0C.\nThe elderly were most affected, with a 70 per cent increase in mortality rate in those aged\n75-94.\nFor Britain, the year as a whole is likely to be the warmest ever recorded, but despite the\nhigh temperature record on 10 August, the summer itself - defined as the June, July and\nAugust period - still comes behind 1976 and 1995, when there were longer periods of\nintense heat. \u201cAt the moment, the year is on course to be the third hottest ever in the global\ntemperature record, which goes back to 1856, behind 1998 and 2002, but when all the\nrecords for October, November and December are collated, it might move into second\nplace/' Professor Jones said. The ten hottest years in the record have all now occurred\nsince 1990. Professor Jones is in no doubt about the astonishing nature of European\nsummer of 2003. \u201cThe temperatures recorded were out of all proportion to the previous\nrecord,\" he said.\n \n\u201cIt was the warmest summer in the past 500 years and probably way beyond that.
