That \u2018Monday morning feeling\u2019 could be a crushing pain in the chest which leaves you\nsweating and gasping for breath. Recent research from Germany and Italy shows that\nheart attacks are more common on Monday morning and doctors blame the stress of\nreturning to work after the weekend break.\nB. The risk of having a heart attack on any given day should be one in seven, but a six-\nyear study coordinated by researchers at the Free University of Berlin of more than 2,600\nGermans revealed that the average person had a 20 per cent higher chance of having a\nheart attack on a Monday than on any other day.\n \nC. Working Germans are particularly vulnerable, with a 33 per cent higher risk at the\nbeginning of the working week. Non-workers, by comparison, appear to be no more at risk\non a Monday than any other day.\nD. A study of 11,000 Italians identified 8 am on a Monday morning as the most stressful\ntime for the heart, and both studies showed that Sunday is the least stressful day, with\nfewer heart attacks in both countries.\nE. The findings could lead to a better understanding of what triggers heart attacks,\naccording to Dr. Stefan Willich of the Free University. \u2018We know a lot about long-term risk\nfactors such as smoking and cholesterol but we don\u2019t know what actually triggers heart\nattacks, so we can\u2019t make specific recommendations about how to prevent them,\u2019 he said.\nF. Monday mornings have a double helping of stress for the working body as it makes a\nrapid transition from sleep to activity, and from the relaxing weekend to the pressures of\nwork. \u2018When people get up, their blood pressure and heart rate go up and there are\nhormonal changes in their bodies,\u2019 Willich explained. \u2018All these things can have an adverse\neffect in the blood system and increase the risk of a clot in the arteries which will cause a\nheart attack.\u2019 \u2018When people return to work after a weekend off, the pace of their life\nchanges. They have a higher workload, more stress, more anger and more physical\nactivity,\u2019 said Willich. \u2018We need to know how these events cause changes in the body\nbefore we can understand if they cause heart attacks.\u2019\nG. But although it is tempting to believe that returning to work increases the risk of a heart\nattack, both Willich and the Italian researchers admit that it is only a partial answer. Both\nstudies showed that the over-65s are also vulnerable on a Monday morning even though\nmost no longer work. The reason for this is not clear, but the Italian team at the Luigi Saddo\nHospital in Milan speculate that social interactions\u2014the thought of facing another week and\nall its pressures\u2014may play a part.\nH. What is clear, however, is that the Monday morning peak seems to be consistent from\nnorthern Germany to southern Italy in spite of the differences in diet and lifestyle.\nI. Willich is reluctant at this stage to make specific recommendations, but he suggests that\n \n1\n\nanyone who suffers from heart disease should take it easy on Monday mornings and leave\npotentially stressful meetings until midweek. \u2018People should try to create a pleasant\nworking environment,\u2019 he added. \u2018Maybe this risk applies only to those who see work as a\nburden, and people who enjoy their work are not so much at risk. We need to find out\nmore.\u2019\n \n2",
