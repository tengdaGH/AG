    "passage_text": "Reading Practice\n \nMartin Luther King\nA\nMartin Luther King was born on January 15, 1929, in Atlanta, Georgia. He was the son of\nthe Reverend Martin Luther King, Sr. and Alberta Williams King. He had an older sister,\nWillie Christine King, and a younger brother Alfred Daniel Williams King. Growing up in\nAtlanta, King attended Booker T. Washington High School. He skipped ninth and twelfth\ngrade, and entered Morehouse College at age fifteen without formally graduating from high\nschool. From the time that Martin was born, he knew that black people and white people\nhad different rights in certain parts of America. If a black family wanted to eat at a\nrestaurant, they had to sit in a separate section of the restaurant. They had to sit at the\nback of the cinema, and even use separate toilets. Worse, and perhaps even more\nhumiliating still, in many southern states, if a black man was on a bus and all the seats\nwere taken, he would have to endure the indignity of relinquishing his own seat to a white\nman. King could never understand the terrible injustice of this.\nIn 1948, he graduated with a Bachelor of Arts degree in sociology. Later, King began\ndoctoral studies in systematic theology at Boston University and received his Doctor of\nPhilosophy on June 5, 1955. King married Coretta Scott, on June 18, 1953 and they had\nfour children.\nB\nReturning to the South to become pastor of a Baptist Church in Montgomery, Alabama,\nKing first achieved national renown when he helped mobilise the black boycott of the\nMontgomery bus system in 1955. This was organised after Rosa Parks, a black woman,\nrefused to give up her seat on the bus to a white man \u2013 in the segregated south, black\npeople could only sit at the back of the bus. The 382-day boycott led the bus company to\nchange its regulations, and the Supreme Court declared such segregation unconstitutional.\nC\nIn 1957 King was active in the organisation of the Southern Leadership Christian\nConference (SCLC), formed to co-ordinate protests against discrimination. He advocated\nnon-violent direct action based on the methods of Gandhi, who led protests against British\nrule in India culminating in India\u2019s independence in 1947. In 1963, King led mass protests\nagainst discriminatory practices in Birmingham, Alabama, where the white population were\nviolently resisting desegregation. The city was dubbed \u2018Bombingham\u2019 as attacks against\ncivil rights protesters increased, and King was arrested and jailed for his part in the\nprotests.\nD\nAfter his release, King participated in the enormous civil rights march, in Washington, in\nAugust 1963, and delivered his famous \u2018I have a dream\u2019 speech, predicting a day when the\npromise of freedom and equality for all would become a reality in America. In 1964 he was\nawarded the Nobel Peace Prize. In 1965, he led a campaign to register blacks to vote. The\nsame year the US Congress passed the Voting Rights Act outlawing the discriminatory\npractices that had barred blacks from voting in the south.\n \n1\n\nE\nAs the civil rights movement became increasingly radicalised, King found that his message\nof peaceful protest was not shared by many in the younger generation. King began to\nprotest against the Vietnam War and poverty levels in the US. On March 29, 1968, King\nwent to Memphis, Tennessee, in support of the black sanitary public works employees who\nhad been on strike since March 12 for higher wages and better treatment. In one incident,\nblack street repairmen had received pay for two hours when they were sent home because\nof bad weather, but white employees had been paid for the full day. King could not bear to\nstand by and let such patent acts of racism go unnoticed. He moved to unite his people,\nand all the peoples of America on the receiving end of discriminatory practices, to protest\nfor their rights, peacefully but steadfastly.\nF\nOn his trip to Memphis, King was booked into room 306 at the Lorraine Motel, owned by\nWalter Bailey. King was shot at 6:01 p.m. April 4, 1968 while he was standing on the\nmotel\u2019s second-floor balcony. King was rushed to St. Joseph\u2019s Hospital, where doctors\nopened his chest and performed manual heart massage. He was pronounced dead at 7:05\np.m. King\u2019s autopsy revealed that although he was only 39 years old, he had the heart of a\n60-year-old man.\n \n2",
