It provokes mixed reactions from its acolytes\nand those that experience it first-hand. Whether you like it or not, it is true to say that work\nis no longer dependent on geography and this opens up a range of opportunities for\nworking in new ways and environments.\nB\nThe surveys show “that the productivity increase is not primarily because of longer working\nhours (as is sometimes suggested). Although prevalent, working more is just one of a\nnumber of influencing factors, and not the most important.” An unusual comparison of the\nperformance of teleworkers with a closely matched control group of non-teleworkers found\nthat not only was productivity higher but also that absenteeism and error rates were lower.\nC\nTwo other areas where SUSTEL has added to the economic impact knowledge base is its\neffect on absenteeism and space utilisation. In the case of absenteeism, over 60 per cent\nof those surveyed stated that telework had enabled them to work when they were\nprevented from reaching a work location (usually through illness or transport problems).\nAround half the cases also identified substantial reductions in space requirements – to the\npoint where one organisation had completely done away with a central office. Changes in\nnon-commuting travel on weekends: home-bases workers, which includes a substantial\npopulation of people who are not telecommuters, spend more time shopping out of the\nhome than traditional workers.\nD\nHalf-time telecommuting could reduce carbon emissions by over 51 million metric tons a\nyear—the equivalent of taking all of New York’s commuters off the road. Additional carbon\nfootprint savings will come from reduced: office energy, roadway repairs, urban heating,\noffice construction, business travel, paper usage (as electronic documents replace paper).\nAlthough energy utilization will continue to grow as we expand our industry and improve\nour standard of living, efficient use of energy will always be of prime importance. By\ntelecommuting to work instead of using more conventional methods, there is a great\npotential to save energy. The three major areas where energy can be conserved are\nVehicle-related materials and resources; Highway-related materials and resources; and\nwork-related materials and resources.\nE\nA tremendous amount of energy is required to produce transportation equipment such as\nautomobiles, buses, trains and jet aircraft. If telecommuting is promoted, there will be less\nuse of this equipment and less energy will be required for production, maintenance and\nrepair of this equipment. Fuel resources and gases needed to operate this equipment will\nbe reduced, as well the building and repair of highways and maintenance requires a large\nconsumption of energy, not only in the operation of the highway construction and repair\n \n1\n\nequipment but also in the manufacture and transportation of the required materials An\nincrease in the percentage of people telecommuting to work will decrease the need for\nexpanded highways and associated road maintenance.

More time working is usually associated with increased stress, domestic\ntension and other factors that reduce the quality of life. One possible explanation is that, for\nmany individuals, their increased working hours will be less than the time they have saved\nin commuting. Hence, they still have more time available for family and other activities. For\nsome, the stress associated with commuting (especially for long distances) may be less\nthan that arising from additional working time. Perhaps most significantly, teleworking can\nin effect create time through opportunities for multi-tasking or greater control of activities.\nAs one survey respondent noted. “Although the amount of time has not changed it has\nmade the weekends freer, as domestic activities can be fitted in during lunchtimes or early\nmorning.”\nH\nWhen you work in an office or a cubicle and something goes wrong with any hardware or\nsoftware you have the option of calling in the IT man.
