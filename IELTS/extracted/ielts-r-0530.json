  "passage_text": "Reading Practice\n \nThe politics of pessimism\nNewspaper headlines and TV or radio news bulletins would have us believe erroneously\nthat a new age has come upon us, the Age of Cassandra. People are being assailed not\njust with contemporary doom, or past gloom, but with prophecies of disasters about to\nbefall. The dawn of the new millennium has now passed; the earth is still intact, and the fin\nde siècle Jeremiahs have now gone off to configure a new date for the apocalypse.\nIt can, I believe, be said with some certainty that the doom-mongers will never run out of\nbusiness. Human nature has an inclination for pessimism and anxiety, with each age\nhaving its demagogues, foretelling doom or dragging it in their wake. But what makes the\nmodern age so different is that the catastrophes are more “in your face”, Their assault on\nour senses is relentless. Whether it be sub-conscious or not, this is a situation not lost on\npoliticians. They play upon people’s propensity for unease, turning it into a very effective\npolitical tool.\nDeluding the general public\nAll too often, when politicians want to change the status quo, they take advantage of\npeople’s fears of the unknown and their uncertainties about the future. For example, details\nabout a new policy may be leaked to the press. Of course, tbe worst case scenario is\npresented in all its depressing detail. When the general public reacts in horror, the\ngovernment appears to cave in. And then accepting some of the suggestions from their\ncritics, ministers water down their proposals. This allows the government to get what It\nwants, while at the same time fooling the public into believing that they have got one over\non the government. Or even that they have some say in the making of policy.,\nThere are several principles at play here. And both are rather simple: unsettle people and\nthen play on their fears; and second, people must be given an opportunity to make a\ncontribution, howevser insignificant, in a given situation; otherwise, they become\ndissatisfied, not fearful or anxious.\nA similar ruse, at a local level, will further illustrate how easily people’s base fears are\nexploited. A common practice is to give people a number of options, say in a housing\ndevelopment, ranging from no change to radical transformation of an area. The aim is to\npersuade people to agree significant modifications, which may involve disruption to their\nlives, and possibly extra expenditure. The individuals, fearful of the worst possible\noutcome, plump for the middle course. And this, incidentally, Is Invariably the option\nfavoured by the authorities. Everything is achieved under the guise of market research, But\nIt is obviously a blatant exercise in the manipulation of people’s fears.\nFear and survival\nFear and anxieties about the future affect us till. People are wracked with self-doubt and\nlow self-esteem. In the struggle to exist and advance in life, a seemingly endless string, of\nobstacles is encountered, so ninny, in fact, that any accomplishment seems surprising.\nEven when people do succeed they are still nagged by uncertainty,\nNot surprisingly, feelings like doubt, fear, anxiety and pessimism are usually associated\nwith failure. Yet, if properly harnessed, they are the driving force behind success, the very\nengines of genius.\n \n1\n\nIf things turn out well for a long time, there is a further anxiety: that of constantly waiting for\nsomething to go wrong. People then find themselves propitiating the gods: not walking on\nlines on the pavements, performing rituals before public performances, wearing particular\nclothes and colours so that they can blame the ritual not themselves when things go wrong,\nBut surely the real terror cornea when success continues uninterrupted for such a long\nperiod of time that we forget what failure is like I\nWe crave for and are fed a daily diet of anxiety, Horror films and disaster movies have an\nincreasing appeal. Nostradamus pops his head up now and again, And other would-be\nprophets make a brief appearance, predicting the demise of human kind.
