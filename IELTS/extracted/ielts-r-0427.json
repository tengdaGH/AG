It seems – as so\noften is the ease – that it depends on which expert you listen to, or which statistics you\nstudy.\nB.\nYes, it is true that there is a mass of evidence to indicate that the world is getting warmer,\nwith one of the world’s leading weather predictors stating that air temperatures have frown\nan increase of just under half a degree Celsius since the beginning of the twentieth century.\nAnd while this may not sound like anything worth losing sleep over, the international press\nwould have us believe that the consequences could be devastating. Other experts,\nhowever, are of the opinion that what we are seeing is just part of a natural upward and\ndownward swing that has always been part of the cycle of global weather.

The effects of such variables as rainfall, cloud formation, the seas and oceans,\ngases such as methane and ozone, or even solar energy are still not really understood,\nand therefore the predictions that we make using them cannot always be relied on.\nDr James Hansen, in 19BH, was predicting that the likely effects of global warming would\nbe a raising of the world temperature which would have disastrous consequences for\nmankind: “a strong cause arid effect relationship between the current climate and human\nalteration of the atmosphere”. He has now gone on record as stating that using artificial\nmodels of climate as a way of predicting change is all but impossible. In fact, he now\nbelieves that, rather than getting hotter, our planet is getting greener as a result of the\ncarbon dioxide increase, with the prospect of increasing vegetation in areas which in recent\nhistory have been frozen wastelands.\nD.\nIn fact, there is some evidence to suggest that as our computer-based weather models\nhave become more sophisticated, the predicted rises In temperature have been cut back.\nIn addition, if we look at the much-reported rise in global temperature over the last century,\na close analysis reveals that the lion’s share of that increase, almost three quarters in total,\noccurred before man began to “poison” his world with industrial processes and the\naccompanying greenhouse gas emissions in the second half of the twentieth century.\nE.\nSo should we pay any attention to those stories that scream out at us from billboards and\ntelevision news headlines, claiming that man, with his inexhaustible dependence on oil-\nbased machinery and ever more sophisticated forms of transport is creating a nightmare\n \n1\n\nlevel of greenhouse gas emissions, poisoning his environment and ripping open the ozone\nlayer?\nDoubters point to scientific evidence, which can prove that, of all the greenhouse gases,\nonly two per cent come from man-made sources, the rest resulting from natural emissions.\nWho, then, to believe: the environmentalist exhorting us to leave the car at home, to buy re-\nusable products packaged in recycled paper and to plant trees in our back yard?
