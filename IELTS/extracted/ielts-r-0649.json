  "passage_text": "Reading Practice\n \nYawning\nHow and why we yarn still presents problems for researchers in an area which has only\nrecently been opened up to study\n \n \n \n \nWhen Robert R Provine began studying yawning in the 1960s, it was difficult for him to\nconvince research students of the merits of 'yawning science1. Although it may appear\nquirky to some, Provine's decision to study yawning was a logical extension of his research\nin developmental neuroscience.\nThe verb 'to yawn' is derived from the Old English ganien or ginian, meaning to gape or\nopen wide. But in addition to gaping jaws, yawning has significant features that are easy to\nobserve and analyse. Provine 'collected' yawns to study by using a variation of the\ncontagion response*. He asked people to 'think about yawning' and, once they began to\nyawn to depress a button and that would record from the start of the yawn to the exhalation\nat its end.\nProvine's early discoveries can be summanized as follows: the yawn is highly stereotyped\nbut not invariant in its duration and form. It is an excellent example of the instinctive 'fixed\naction pattern' of classical animal-behavior study, or ethology. It is not a reflex (short-\nduration, rapid, proportional response to a simple stimulus), but, once started, a yawn\nprogresses with the inevitability of a sneeze. The standard yawn runs its course over about\nsix seconds on average, but its duration can range from about three seconds to much\nlonger than the average. There are no half-yawns: this is an example of the typical intensity\nof fixed action patterns and a reason why you cannot stifle yawns. Just like a cough, yawns\ncan come in bouts with a highly variable inter-yawn interval, which is generally about 68\nseconds but rarely more than 70. There is no relation between yawn frequency and\nduration: producers of short or long yawns do not compensate by yawning more or less\noften. Furthermore, Provine's hypotheses about the form and function of yawning can be\ntested by three informative yawn variants which can be used to look at the roles of the\nnose, the mouth and the jaws.\ni) The closed nose yawn\nSubjects are asked to pinch their nose closed when they feel themselves start to yawn.\nMost subjects report being able to perform perfectly normal closed nose yawns. This\nindicates that the inhalation at the onset of a yawn, and the exhalation at its end, need not\ninvolve the nostrils - the mouth provides a sufficient airway.\nii) The clenched teeth yawn\nSubjects are asked to clench their teeth when they feel themselves start to yawn but allow\nthemselves to inhale normally through their open lips and clenched teeth. This variant gives\none the sensation of being stuck midyawn. This shows that gaping of the jaws is an\nessential component of the fixed action pattern of the yawn, and unless it is accomplished,\nthe program (or pattern) will not run to completion. The yawn is also shown to be more than\na deep breath, because, unlike normal breathing, inhalation and exhalation cannot be\nperformed so well through the clenched teeth as through the nose.\niii) The nose yawn \n \n1\n\n \nThis variant tests the adequacy of the nasal airway to sustain a yawn. Unlike normal\nbreathing, which can be performed equally well through mouth or nose, yawning is\nimpossible via nasal inhalation alone. As with the clenched teeth yawn, the nose yawn\nprovides the unfulfilling sensation of being stuck in mid-yawn. Exhalation, on the other\nhand, can be accomplished equally well through nose or mouth. Through thin methodology\nProvine demonstrated that inhalation through the oral airway and the gaping of jaws are\nnecessary for normal yawns. The motor program for yawning will not run to completion\nwithout feedback that these parts of the program have been accomplished.\nBut yawning is a powerful, generalized movement that involves much more than airway\nmaneuvres and jaw-gaping. When yawning you also stretch your facial muscles, tilt your\nhead back, narrow or close your eyes, produce tears, salivate, open the Eustachian tubes\nof your middle ear and perform many other, yet unspecified, cardiovascular and respiratory\nacts. Perhaps the yawn shares components with other behaviour. For example, in the yawn\na kind of 'slow sneeze1 or is the sneeze a 'fast yawn'? Both share common respiratory and\nother features including jaw gaping, eye closing and head tilting.\nYawning and stretching share properties and may be performed together as parts of a\nglobal motor complex. Studies by J I p deVries et al. in the early 1980s, charting movement\nin the developing foet US using ultrasound, observed a link between yawning and\nstretching. The most extraordinary demonstration of the yawn-stretch linkage occurs in\nmany people paralyzed on one side of their body because of brain damage caused by a\nstroke, the prominent British neurologist Sir Francis Walshe noted in 1923 that when these\npeople yawn, they are startled and mystified to observe that their otherwise paralyzed arm\nrises and flexes automatically in what neurologists term an 'associated response'. Yawning\napparently activates undamaged, unconsciously controlled connections between the brain\nand the motor system, causing the paralyzed limb to move. It is not known whether the\nassociated response is a positive prognosis for recovery, nor whether yawning is\ntherapeutic for prevention of muscular deterioration.\nProvine speculated that, in general, yawning may have many functions, and selecting a\nsingle function from the available options may be an unrealistic goal. Yawning appears to\nbe associated with a change of behavioral state, switching from one activity to another.\nYawning is also a reminder that ancient and unconscious behavior linking US to the animal\nworld lurks beneath the veneer of culture, rationality and language.\n \n2",
