  "passage_text": "Reading Practice\n \nThe history of the poster\nThe appearance of the poster has changed continuously over the past two centuries.\nThe first posters were known as ‘broadsides’ and were used for public and commercial\nannouncements. Printed on one side only using metal type, they were quickly and crudely\nproduced in large quantities. As they were meant to be read at a distance, they required\nlarge lettering.\nThere were a number of negative aspects of large metal type. It was expensive, required a\nlarge amount of storage space and was extremely heavy. If a printer did have a collection\nof large metal type, it was likely that there were not enough letters. So printers did their\nbest by mixing and matching styles.\nCommercial pressure for large type was answered with the invention of a system for wood\ntype production. In 1827, Darius Wells invented a special wood drill - the lateral router -\ncapable of cutting letters on wood blocks. The router was used in combination with William\nLeavenworth’s pantograpn (1834) to create decorative wooden letters of all shapes and\nsizes. The first posters began to appear, but they had little colour and design; often wooden\ntype was mixed with metal type in a conglomeration of styles.\nA major development in poster design was the application of lithography, invented by Alois\nSenefelder in 1796, which allowed artists to hand-draw letters, opening the field of type\ndesign to endless styles. The method involved drawing with a greasy crayon onto finely\nsurfaced Bavarian limestone and offsetting that image onto paper. This direct process\ncaptured the artist's true intention; however, the final printed image was in reverse. The\nimages and lettering needed to be drawn backwards, often reflected in a mirror or traced\non transfer paper.\nAs a result of this technical difficulty, the invention of the lithographic process had little\nimpact on posters until the 1860s, when Jules Cheret came up with his ‘three-stone\nlithographic process’. This gave artists the opportunity to experiment with a wide spectrum\nof colours.\nAlthough the process was difficult, the result was remarkable, with nuances of colour\nimpossible in other media even to this day. The ability to mix words and images in such an\nattractive and economical format finally made the lithographic poster a powerful innovation.\nStarting in the 1870s, posters became the main vehicle for advertising prior to the\nmagazine era and the dominant means of mass communication in the rapidly growing cities\nof Europe and America. Yet in the streets of Paris, Milan and Berlin, these artistic prints\nwere so popular that they were stolen off walls almost as soon as they were hung. Cheret,\nlater known as ‘the father of the modern poster’, organised the first exhibition of posters in\n1884 and two years later published the first book on poster art. He quickly took advantage\nof the public interest by arranging for artists to create posters, at a reduced size, that were\nsuitable for in-home display.\nThanks to Cheret. the poster slowly took hold in other countries in the 1890s and came to\ncelebrate each society’s unique cultural institutions: the cafe in France, the opera and\nfashion in Italy, festivals in Spain, literature in Holland and trade fairs in Germany. The first\nposter shows were held in Great\n \n1\n\nBritain and Italy in 1894, Germany in 1896 and Russia in 1897. The most important poster\nshow ever, to many observers, was held in Reims, France, in 1896 and featured an\nunbelievable 1,690 posters arranged by country.\nIn the early 20th century, the poster continued to play a large communication role and to go\nthrough a range of styles. By the 1950s, however, it had begun to share the spotlight with\nother media, mainly radio and print. By this time, most posters were printed using the mass\nproduction technique of photo offset, which resulted in the familiar dot pattern seen in\nnewspapers and magazines. In addition, the use of photography in posters, begun in\nRussia in the twenties, started to become as common as illustration.\nIn the late fifties, a new graphic style that had strong reliance on typographic elements in\nblack and white appeared. The new style came to be known as the International\nTypographic Style. It made use of a mathematical grid, strict graphic rules and black-and-\nwhite photography to provide a clear and logical structure. It became the predominant style\nin the world in the 1970s and continues to exert its influence today.\nIt was perfectly suited to the increasingly international post-war marketplace, where there\nwas a strong demand for clarity. This meant that the accessibility of words and symbols\nhad to be taken into account. Corporations wanted international identification, and events\nsuch as the Olympics called for universal solutions, which the Typographic Style could\nprovide.\nHowever, the International Typographic Style began to lose its energy in the late 1970s.\nMany criticised it for being cold, formal and dogmatic.\nA young teacher in Basel. Wolfgang Weingart, experimented with the offset printing\nprocess to produce posters that appeared complex and chaotic, playful and spontaneous -\nall in stark contrast to what had gone before. Weingart's liberation of typography was an\nimportant foundation for several new styles. These ranged from Memphis and Retro to the\nadvances now being made in computer graphics.\n \nAdapted from www.internationalposter.com\n \n2",
