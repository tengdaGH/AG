  "passage_text": "Reading Practice\n \n \nThe Birth of Scientific English\nWorld science is dominated today by a small number of languages, including Japanese,\nGerman and French, but it is English which is probably the most popular global language of\nscience. This is not just because of the importance of English- speaking countries such as\nthe USA in scientific research; the scientists of many non-English-speaking countries find\nthat they need to write their research papers in English to reach a wide international\naudience. Given the prominence of scientific English today, it may seem surprising that no\none really knew how to write science in English before the 17th century. Before that, Latin\nwas regarded as the lingua franca1 for European intellectuals.\nThe European Renaissance (c. 14th-16th century) is sometimes called the 'revival of\nlearning', a time of renewed interest in the 'lost knowledge' of classical times. At the same\ntime, however, scholars also began to test and extend this knowledge. The emergent\nnation states of Europe developed competitive interests in world exploration and the\ndevelopment of trade. Such expansion, which was to take the English language west to\nAmerica and east to India, was supported by scientific developments such as the discovery\nof magnetism (and hence the invention of the compass), improvements in cartography and\n- perhaps the most important scientific revolution of them all - the new theories of\nastronomy and the movement of the Earth in relation to the planets and stars, developed\nby Copernicus (1473-1543).\nEngland was one of the first countries where scientists adopted and publicised Copernican\nideas with enthusiasm. Some of these scholars, including two with interests in language -\nJohn Wallis and John Wilkins - helped found the Royal Society in 1660 in order to promote\nempirical scientific research.\nAcross Europe similar academies and societies arose, creating new national traditions of\nscience. In the initial stages of the scientific revolution, most publications in the national\nlanguages were popular works, encyclopaedias, educational textbooks and translations.\nOriginal science was not done in English until the second half of the 17th century. For\nexample, Newton published his mathematical treatise, known as the Principia, in Latin, but\npublished his later work on the properties of light - Opticks - in English.\nThere were several reasons why original science continued to be written in Latin.\nThe first was simply a matter of audience. Latin was suitable for an international audience\nof scholars, whereas English reached a socially wider, but more local audience. Hence,\npopular science was written in English. \nA second reason for writing in Latin' may, perversely, have been a concern for secrecy.\nOpen publication had dangers in putting into the public domain preliminary ideas which had\nnot yet been fully exploited by their 'author'. This growing concern about intellectual\nproperty rights was a feature of the period - it reflected both the humanist notion of the\nindividual, rational scientist who invents and discovers through private intellectual labour,\nand the growing connection between original science and commercial exploitation. There\nwas something of a social distinction between 'scholars and gentlemen' who understood\nLatin, and men of trade who lacked a classical education. And in the mid-17fh century it\nwas common practice for mathematicians to keep their discoveries and proofs secret, by\nwriting them in cipher, in obscure languages, or in private messages deposited in a sealed\n \n1\n\nbox with the Royal Society. Some scientists might have felt more comfortable with Latin\nprecisely because its audience, though international, was socially restricted.\nDoctors clung the most keenly to Latin as an 'insider language'.\nA third reason why the writing of original science in English was delayed may have been to\ndo with the linguistic inadequacy of English in the early modern period.\nEnglish was not well equipped to deal with scientific argument. First, it lacked the\nnecessary technical vocabulary. Second, it lacked the grammatical resources required to\nrepresent the world in an objective and impersonal way, and to discuss the relations, such\nas cause and effect, that might hold between complex and hypothetical entities.\nFortunately, several members of the Royal Society possessed an interest in language and\nbecame engaged in various linguistic projects. Although a proposal in 1664 to establish a\ncommittee for improving the English language came to little, the society's members did a\ngreat deal to foster the publication of science in English and to encourage the development\nof a suitable writing style. Many members of the Royal Society also published monographs\nin English. One of the first was by Robert Hooke, the society's first curator of experiments,\nwho described his experiments with microscopes in Micrographia (1665). This work is\nlargely narrative in style, based on a transcript of oral demonstrations and lectures.\nIn 1665 a new scientific journal. Philosophical Transactions, was inaugurated. Perhaps the\nfirst international English-language scientific journal, it encouraged a new genre of scientific\nwriting, that of short, focused accounts of particular experiments.\nThe 17th century was thus a formative period in the establishment of scientific English. In\nthe following century much of this momentum was lost as German established itself as the\nleading European language of science. It is estimated that by the end of the 1 8th century\n401 German scientific journals had been established as opposed to 96 in France and 50 in\nEngland. However, in the 19th century scientific English again enjoyed substantial lexical\ngrowth as the industrial revolution created the need for new technical vocabulary, and new,\nspecialised, professional societies were instituted to promote and publish in the new\ndisciplines.\n1lingua franca: a language which is used for communication between groups of people who\nspeak different languages\n \n2",
