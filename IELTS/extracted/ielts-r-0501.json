  "passage_text": "Reading Practice\n \nThe Impact of Wilderness Tourism\nA\nThe market for tourism In remote areas is booming as never before. Countries ail across\nthe world are actively promoting their ‘wilderness’ regions - such as mountains, Arctic\nlands, deserts, small islands and wetlands - to high-spending tourists. The attraction of\nthese areas is obvious.- by definition, wilderness tourism requires little or no initial\ninvestment. But that does not mean that there is no cost. As the 1992 United Nations\nConference on Environment and Development recognized, these regions are fragile (i.e.\nhighly vulnerable to abnormal pressures) not just in terms of their ecology, but also in terms\nof the culture of their inhabitants. The three most significant types of fragile environment in\nthese respects, and also in terms of the proportion of the Earth's surface they cover, are\ndeserts, mountains and Arctic areas. An important characteristic is their marked\nseasonality, with harsh conditions prevailing for many months each year. Consequently,\nmost human activities, including tourism, are limited to quite clearly defined parts of the\nyear.\nTourists are drawn to these regions by their natural landscape beauty and the unique\ncultures of their indigenous people. And poor governments in these isolated areas have\nwelcomed the new breed of ‘adventure tourist’, grateful for the hard currency they bring.\nFor several years now, tourism has been the prime source of foreign exchange in Nepal\nand Bhutan. Tourism is also a key element in the economies of Arctic zones such as\nLapland and Alaska and in desert areas such as Ayers Rock in Australia and Arizona’s\nMonument Valley.\nB \nOnce a location is established as a main tourist destination, the effects on the local\ncommunity are profound. When hill-farmers, for example, can make more money in a few\nweeks working as porters for foreign trekkers than they can in a year working in their fields,\nit is not surprising that many of them give up their farm-work, which is thus left to other\nmembers of the family. In some hill-regions, this has led to a serious decline in farm output\nand a change in the local diet, because there is insufficient labour to maintain terraces and\nirrigation systems and tend to crops. The result has been that many people in these\nregions have turned to outside supplies of rice and other foods.\nIn Arctic and desert societies, year-round survival has traditionally depended on hunting\nanimals and fish and collecting fruit over a relatively short season. However, as some\ninhabitants become Involved in tourism, they no longer have time to collect wild food; this\nhas led to increasing dependence on bought food and stores. Tourism is not always the\nculprit behind such changes. All kinds of wage labour, or government handouts, tend to\nundermine traditional survival systems. Whatever the cause, the dilemma is always the\nsame: what happens If these new, external sources of income dry up?\nThe physical impact of visitors is another serious problem associated with the growth In\nadventure tourism. Much attention has focused on erosion along major trails, but perhaps\nmore important are the deforestation and impacts on water supplies arising from the need\nto provide tourists with cooked food and hot showers. In both mountains and deserts, slow-\ngrowing trees are often the main sources of fuel and water supplies may be limited or\n \n1\n\nvulnerable to degradation through heavy use.\nC\nStories about the problems of tourism have become legion in the last few years. Yet it does\nnot have to be a problem. Although tourism inevitably affects the region in which it takes\nplace, the costs to these fragile environments and their local cultures can be minimized.\nIndeed, it can even be a vehicle for reinvigorating local cultures, as has happened with the\nSherpas of Nepal’s Khumbu Valley and in some Alpine villages. And a growing number of\nadventure tourism operators are trying to ensure that their activities benefit the local\npopulation and environment over the long term.\nIn the Swiss Alps, communities have decided that their future depends on integrating\ntourism more effectively with the local economy. Local concern about the rising number of\nsecond home developments in the Swiss Pays d'Enhaut resulted in limits being imposed\non their growth. There has also been a renaissance in communal cheese production In the\narea, providing the locals with a reliable source of income that does not depend on outside\nvisitors.\nMany of the Arctic tourist destinations have been exploited by outside companies, who\nemploy transient workers and repatriate most of the profits to their home base. But some\nArctic communities are now operating tour businesses themselves, thereby ensuring that\nthe benefits accrue locally. For instance, a native corporation in Alaska, employing local\npeople. Is running an air tour from Anchorage to Kotzebue, where tourists eat Arctic food,\nwalk on the tundra and watch local musicians and dancers.\nNative people In the desert regions of the American Southwest have followed similar\nstrategies, encouraging tourists to visit their pueblos and reservations to purchase high-\nquality handicrafts and artwork. The Acoma and San lldefonso pueblos have established\nhighly profitable pottery businesses, while the Navajo and Hopi groups have been similarly\nsuccessful with jewellery.\n \nToo many people living in fragile environments have lost control over their economies, their\nculture and their environment when tourism has penetrated their homelands. Merely\nrestricting tourism cannot be the solution to the imbalance, because people's desire to see\nnew places will not just disappear. Instead, communities in fragile environments must\nachieve greater control over tourism ventures in their regions, in order to balance their\nneeds and aspirations with the demands of tourism. A growing number of communities are\ndemonstrating that, with firm communal decision-making, this is possible. The critical\nquestion now is whether this can become the norm, rather than the exception.\n \n2",
