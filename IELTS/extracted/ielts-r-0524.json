  "passage_text": "Reading Practice\n \nThe Need to Belong\nNo one likes to feel left out, ignored by colleagues at meetings or not be invited to the big\nparty that everyone is talking about Imagine not being part of a joke, or worse still, if the\njoke is on you. For most people, living the life of an outsider can have a negative effect on\nselfe-steem and mood. It can even lead to negative behaviour. The pull to belong is\nextremely strong. Scientists believe that, in part, there is an evolutionary explanation for\nwhy we have this need to belong.\nIn the past, people hunted and cooked together in tribes and each member of the group\nwould be assigned a role. As each member had a purpose, it meant that in the event of the\nloss of one person, the group as a whole would suffer. For this reason, they had a vested\ninterest in protecting each other. To our prehistoric ancestors, membership of a group\nmeant the difference between survival and death.Those who were rejected and excluded\nfrom joining a group had to fend for themselves and struggled to stay alive alone in the\nwild. Apart from protection, being part of a group also ensured that genes could be passed\non to future generations. Although it is very different now from the way our primitive\nancestors lived, our brains have not had time to evolve to fit today’s lifestyles. In this day\nand age, it is no longer a matter of survival to be affiliated to a tribe or group, but the\nevolutionary instinct to find protection still lingers.\nThis inherent feeling of security that comes with being part of a group is powerful enough to\nmake people employ both conscious and unconscious strategies to gain membership. One\nobvious way people try to be accepted into a group is self-presentation, which is the act of\nportraying yourself in the best possible light An individual will attempt to outwardly display\nthe characteristics which are important to the group’s advancement At the same time, they\nwill conceal any parts of their personality that may be seen as undesirable or not useful to a\ngroup. An example of self-presentation is the job application process. A candidate applying\nfor a job will promote themselves as motivated, but is likely to hide the fact that they are\ndisorganised. These conscious tactics that people use are not a surprise to anyone, but we\nalso use other strategies unknowingly.\nPsychologists Jessica Larkin, Tanya Chartrand and Robert Arkin suggested that people\noften resort to automatic mimicry to gain affiliation into groups, much like our primitive\nancestors used to do. Before humans had the ability to speak, physical imitation was a\nmethod of begging for a place in the group. Most will be unaware they are doing it Larkin\nand her co-workers decided to test this hypothesis.\nThey took a group of student volunteers and had them play a game called Cyberball, a\nballtossing arcade game that resembled American football. The volunteers were led to\nbelieve they were all playing against each other, but in actual fact they were not The\ncomputer was manipulating the game by passing the ball to some volunteers and excluding\nothers.\nThe ‘accepted’and ‘rejected’students were then asked if they enjoyed the game and about\ntheir opinions of the other players. Participants were then put alone in a room and their\nnatural foot movements were filmed. Then a female entered the room under the pretence\nof conducting a fake photo descnption task. I he female deliberately moved her foot during\nthe task, but not in a way that would be noticeable to the volunteer. It turned out that the\nrejected students mimicked the female’s foot movements the most This revealed that after\n \n1\n\nexclusion, people will automatically mimic to affiliate with someone new.\nHowever, Larkin and her colleagues wanted to go further.They believed that more often\nthan not, in the real world, we actually know the people that reject us. How do we behave\ntowards the group that we know has excluded us? The experiment was repeated with this\nquestion in mind. In the second experiment, only female volunteers played the Cyberball\ngame, during which they experienced rejection by either men or women.Then each\nvolunteer did the fake photo task, but this time with a man and then a woman. The results\nclearly indicated that the female students that felt rejected would unconsciously make more\nof an effort to mimic members of their own in-group – that is, other women – rather than\nmen. This deep-wired instinct to mimic was not only directed towards random people, as\ninitially thought, but targeted to specific groups, the particular group that did the rejecting in\nthe first place.\nTo some, it is inconceivable why people will go to great lengths to be accepted into one of\nlife’s social groups or clubs, enduring rejection and sometimes humiliation in order to be\naccepted. You only have to look at college campuses, which are notorious for strict\ninitiations inflicted on candidates desperately seeking membership. But it happens and will\ncontinue to happen, because the desire to belong is a very powerful force and a\nfundamental part of human nature.\n \n2",
