  "passage_text": "Reading Practice\n \nPsychology of new product adoption\nA\nIn today’s hypercompetitive marketplace, companies that successfully introduce new\nproducts are more likely to flourish than those that don’t. businesses spend billions of\ndollars making better “mousetraps” only to find consumers roundly rejecting them. Studies\nshow that new products fail at the stunning rate of between 40% and 90%, depending on\nthe category, and the odds haven’t changed much in the past 25 years. In the U.S.\npackaged goods industry, for instance, companies introduce 30,000 products every year,\nbut 70% to 90% of them don’t stay on store shelves for more than 12 months. Most\ninnovative products – those that create new product categories or revolutionize old ones –\nare also unsuccessful. According to one study, 47% of first movers have failed, meaning\nthat approximately half the companies that pioneered new product categories later pulled\nout of those businesses.\nB\nAfter the fact, experts and novices alike tend to dismiss unsuccessful innovations as bad\nideas that were destined to fail. Why do consumers fail to buy innovative products even\nwhen they offer distinct improvements over existing ones? Why do companies invariably\nhave more faith in new products than is warranted? Few would question the objective\nadvantages of many innovations over existing alternatives, but that’s often not enough for\nthem to succeed. To understand why new products fail to live up to companies’\nexpectations, we must delve into the psychology of behavior change.\nC\nNew products often require consumers to change their behavior. As companies know,\nthose behavior changes entail costs. Consumers costs, such as the activation fees they\nhave to pay when they switch from one cellular service provider to another. They also bear\nlearning costs, such as when they shift from manual to automatic automobile\ntransmissions. People sustain obsolescence costs, too. For example, when they switch\nfrom VCRs to DVD players, their videotape collections become useless. All of these are\neconomic switching costs that most companies routinely anticipate.\nD\nWhat businesses don’t take into account, however, are the psychological costs associated\nwith behavior change. Many products fail because of a universal, but largely ignored,\npsychological bias: People irrationally overvalue benefits they currently possess relative to\nthose they don’t. The bias leads consumers to value the advantages of products they own\nmore than the benefits of new ones. It also leads executives to value the benefits of\ninnovations they’ve developed over the advantages of incumbent products.\nE\nCompanies have long assumed that people will adopt new products that deliver more value\nor utility than existing ones. Thus, businesses need only to develop innovations that are\nobjectively superior to incumbent products, and consumers will have sufficient incentive to\npurchase them. In the 1960s, communications scholar Everett Rogers called the concept\n \n1\n\n“relative advantage” and identified it as the most critical driver of new-product adoption.\nThis argument assumes that companies make unbiased assessments of innovations and of\nconsumers, likelihood of adopting them. Although compelling, the theory has one major\nflaw: It fails to capture the psychological biases that affect decision making.\nF\nIn 2002, psychologist Daniel Kahneman won the Nobel Prize in economics for a body of\nwork that explores why and when individuals deviate from rational economic behavior. One\nof the cornerstones of that research, developed with psychologist Amos Tversky, is how\nindividuals value prospects, or choices, in the marketplace. Kahneman and Tversky\nshowed, and others have confirmed, that human beings’ responses to the alternatives\nbefore they have four distinct characteristics.\nG\nFirst, people evaluate the attractiveness of an alternative based not on its objective, or\nactual, value but on its subjective, or perceived value. Second, consumers evaluate new\nproducts or investments relative to a reference point, usually the products they already own\nor consume. Third, people view any improvements relative to this reference point as gains\nand treat all shortcomings as losses. Fourth, and most important, losses have a far greater\nimpact on people than similarly sized gains, a phenomenon that Kahneman and Tversky\ncalled “loss aversion.” For instance, studies show that most people will not accept a bet in\nwhich there is a 50% chance of winning $100 and a 50% chance of losing $100. The gains\nfrom the wager must outweigh the losses by a factor of between two and three before most\npeople find such a bet attractive. Similarly, a survey of 1,500 customers of Pacific Gas and\nElectric revealed that consumers demand three to four times more compensation to endure\na power outage – and suffer a loss – than they are willing to pay to avoid the problem, a\npotential gain. As Kahneman and Tversky wrote, “losses loom larger than gains.”\nH\nLoss aversion leads people to value products that they already possess – those that are\npart of their endowment – more than those they don’t have. According to behavioral\neconomist Richard Thaler, consumers value what they own, but many have to give up,\nmuch more than they value what they don’t own but could obtain. Thaler called that bias\nthe “endowment effect.”\nI\nIn a 1990 paper, Thaler and his colleagues describe a series of experiments they\nconducted to measure the magnitude of the endowment effect. In one such experiment,\nthey gave coffee mugs to a group of people, the Sellers, and asked at what price point –\nfrom 25 cents to $9.25 – the Sellers would be willing to part with those mugs. They asked\nanother group – the Choosers – to whom they didn’t give coffee mugs, to indicate whether\nthey would choose the mug or the money at each price point. In objective terms, all the\nSellers and Choosers were in the same situation: They were choosing between a mug and\na sum of money. In one trial of this experiment, the Sellers priced the mug at $7.12, on\naverage, but the Choosers were willing to pay only $3.12. In another trial, the Sellers and\nthe Choosers valued the mug at $7.00 and $3.50, respectively. Overall, the Sellers always\ndemanded at least twice as much to give up the mugs as the Choosers would pay to obtain\nthem.\n \n2\n\nJ\nKahneman and Tversky’s research also explains why people tend to stick with what they\nhave even if a better alternative exists. In a 1989 paper, economist Jack Knetsch provided\na compelling demonstration of what economists William Samuelson and Richard\nZeckhauser called the “status quo bias.” Knetsch asked one group of students to choose\nbetween an attractive coffee mug and a large bar of Swiss chocolate. He gave a second\ngroup of students the coffee mugs but a short time later allowed each student to exchange\nhis or her mug for a chocolate bar. Finally, Knetsch gave chocolate bars to a third group of\nstudents but much later allowed each student to exchange his or her bar for a mug. Of the\nstudents given a choice at the outset, 56% chose the mug, and 44% chose the chocolate\nbar, indicating a near even split in preferences between the two products. Logically,\ntherefore, about half of the students to whom Knetsch gave the coffee mug should have\ntraded for the chocolate bar and vice versa. That didn’t happen. Only 11% of the students\nwho had been given the mugs and 10% of those who had been given the chocolate bars\nwanted to exchange their products. To approximately 90% of the students, giving up what\nthey already had seemed like a painful loss and shrank their desire to trade.\nK\nInterestingly, most people seem oblivious to the existence of the behaviors implicit in the\nendowment effect and the status quo bias. In study after study, when researchers\npresented people with evidence that they had irrationally overvalued the status quo, they\nwere shocked, skeptical, and more than a bit defensive. These behavioral tendencies are\nuniversal, but awareness of them is not.\n \n3",
