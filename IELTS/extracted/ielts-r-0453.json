  "passage_text": "Reading Practice\n \nThe creation of lasting memories\nMany studies of the brain processes underlying the creation of memory consolidation\n(lasting memories) have involved giving various human and animal subjects treatment,\nwhile training them to perform a task. These have contributed greatly to our understanding.\nIn pioneering studies using goldfish, Bernard Agranoff found that protein synthesis\ninhibitors injected after training caused the goldfish to forget what they had learned. In\nother experiments, he administered protein synthesis inhibitors immediately before the fish\nwere trained. The remarkable finding was that the fish learned the task completely\nnormally, but forgot it within a few hours - that is, the protein synthesis inhibitors blocked\nmemory consolidation, but did not influence short-term memory.\nThere is now extensive evidence that short-term memory is spared by many kinds of\ntreatments, including electro-convulsive therapy (ECT), that block memory consolidation.\nOn the other hand, and equally importantly, neuroscientist Ivan Izquierdo found that many\ndrug treatments can block short-term memory without blocking memory consolidation.\nContrary to the hypothesis put forward by Canadian psychologist Donald Hebb, in 1949,\nlong-term memory does not require short-term memory, and vice versa.\nSuch findings suggest that our experiences create parallel, and possibly independent\nstages of memory, .each with a different life span. All of this evidence from clinical and\nexperimental studies strongly indicates that the brain handles recent and remote memory in\ndifferent ways; but why does it do that?\nWe obviously need to have memory that is created rapidly: reacting to an ever and rapidly\nchanging environment requires that. For example, most current building codes require that\nthe heights of all steps in a staircase be equal. After taking a couple of steps, up or down,\nwe implicitly remember the heights of the steps and assume that the others will be the\nsame. If they are not the same, we are very likely to trip and fall. Lack of this kind of rapidly\ncreated implicit memory would be bad for us and for insurance companies, but perhaps\ngood for lawyers. It would be of little value to us if we remembered the heights of the steps\nonly after a delay of many hours, when the memory becomes consolidated.\nThe hypothesis that lasting memory consolidates slowly over time is supported primarily by\nclinical and experimental evidence that the formation of long-term memory is influenced by\ntreatments and disorders affecting brain functioning. There are also other kinds of evidence\nindicating more directly that the memories consolidate over time after learning. Avi Kami\nand Dov Sagi reported that the performance of human subjects trained in a visual skill did\nnot improve until eight hours after the training was completed, and that improvement was\neven greater the following day. Furthermore, the skill was retained for several years.\nStudies using human brain imaging to study changes in neural activity induced by learning\nhave also reported that the changes continue to develop for hours after learning. In an\ninnovative study using functional imaging of the brain, Reza Shadmehr and Henry Holcomb\nexamined brain activity in several brain regions shortly after human subjects were trained in\na motor learning task requiring arm and hand movements. They found that while the\nperformance of the subjects remained stable for several hours after completion of the\ntraining, their brain activity did not; different regions of the brain were predominantly active\nat different times over a period of several hours after the training. The activity shifted from\n \n1\n\nthe prefrontal cortex to two areas known to be involved in controlling movements, the motor\ncortex and cerebellar cortex. Consolidation of the motor skill appeared to involve activation\nof different neural systems that increased the stability of the brain processes underlying the\nskill.\nThere is also evidence that learning-induced changes in the activity of neurons in the\ncerebral cortex continue to increase for many days after the training. In an extensive series\nof studies using rats with electrodes implanted in the auditory cortex, Norman Weinberger\nreported that, after a tone of specific frequency was paired a few times with footshock,\nneurons in the rats’ auditory cortex responded more to that specific tone and less to other\ntones of other frequencies. Even more interestingly, the selectivity of the neurons’ response\nto the specific tone used in training continued to increase for several days after the training\nwas terminated.\nIt is not intuitively obvious why our lasting memories consolidate slowly. Certainly, one can\nwonder why we have a form of memory that we have to rely on for many hours, days or a\nlifetime, that is so susceptible to disruption shortly after it is initiated. Perhaps the brain\nsystem that consolidates long-term memory over time was a late development in vertebrate\nevolution. Moreover, maybe we consolidate memories slowly because our mammalian\nbrains are large and enormously complex. We can readily reject these ideas. All species of\nanimals studied to date have both short and long-term memory; and all are susceptible to\nretrograde amnesia. Like humans, birds, bees, and molluscs, as well as fish and rats, make\nlong-term memory slowly. Consolidation of memory clearly emerged early in evolution, and\nwas conserved.\nAlthough there seems to be no compelling reason to conclude that a biological system\nsuch as a brain could not quickly make a lasting memory, the fact is that animal brains do\nnot. Thus, memory consolidation must serve some very important adaptive function or\nfunctions. There is considerable evidence suggesting that the slow consolidation is\nadaptive because it enables neurobiological processes occurring shortly after learning to\ninfluence the strength of memory for experiences. The extensive evidence that memory\ncan be enhanced, as well as impaired, by treatments administered shortly after training,\nprovides intriguing support for this hypothesis.\n \n2",
