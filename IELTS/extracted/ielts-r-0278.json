  "passage_text": "Reading Practice\n \nMarketing And Mind Control\nHow marketing and advertising appeal to the associative nature of the brain\nWhile there had been a long tradition of giving rings as a commitment to marry, the custom\nof giving diamond engagement rings was in large part manufactured by one of the most\neffective marketing campaigns in history . In the early 1900s, diamond sales were\ndeclining, posing a serious problem for the company that essentially had control over the\ndiamond market. In 1938, this company hired an advertising agency. Which proposed\nreshaping social attitudes toward diamonds? As well as magazines showing film stars\ndraped in diamonds, the agency arranged for movies to incorporate diamond engagement\nrings into their plots. The campaign culminated with the slogan:' A diamond is forever. At\nthe time, the approach was unique. Rather than pushing a brand, the objective was to\npromote diamonds as the symbol of everlasting love. This was achieved by exploiting the\nassociative nature of the brain: associating neurons! Activated by the concept of' love ' with\nneurons that encoded the concept of “diamonds. By 1941, diamond sales had increased by\n55 %.\nAdvertising comes in many forms, from blatant neon signs to subtly embedded products in\nmovies. In each case, the goal is to mould our habits, desires and opinions. Our visual\nsystem is targeted by an avalanche of information on the internet, street posters, and\nbillboards and in movie theatres. Our auditory system submits to catchy radio jingles and\ntelemarketers. More surreptitiously, our olfactory system is targeted by variations of vanilla\nand citrus perfumes aimed at enticing US to linger in a retail outlet. It is difficult to measure\nhow effective these campaigns are, but as in the ' A diamond is forever ’ campaign, they\ncan be so successful that they change the fabric of our culture. In the case of bottled water,\nwe are swayed by advertising into paying for something that we can obtain for free. Most\npeople cannot distinguish bottled from tap water, much less between brands of bottled\nwater, which is why you rarely hear of a bottled water company proposing a blind taste test.\nSo why is marketing such an effective mind - control technique? It is interesting to consider\nwhether other animals exhibit anything analogous to humans ' susceptibility to advertising.\nIf we provide a lab rat with two types of cereal, it will consume approximately the same\namount of each. However, if we put that rat with another rat that spent its day eating just\none type, when faced with a choice, our rat will now show a preference for the same type\nas the other rat was eating. Psychologists call this ' socially transmitted food preference ‘.\nWhat many regard as the first documented examples of cultural learning in primates started\nwith a clever monkey that lived in a colony of Japanese monkeys on the island of Koshima.\nShe began taking her dirt - covered sweet potatoes to the river to wash them before eating\nthem. Upon seeing this, a few 11 other open - minded monkeys picked up on the idea.\nPotato washing then spread from monkey to monkey and, over the course of a few years,\nmost monkeys were eating clean potatoes. Humans are clearly not the only animals to\nengage in imitation and social learning.\nLearning by observation can be an extraordinarily valuable brain feature, this is how we\nlearn to communicate and perform motor skills as well as deal with many everyday\nproblems. For example, a newcomer struggling to purchase tickets and navigate the\nsubway system in a foreign city may step back to learn from the people nearby. Humans\nand other primates exhibit multiple forms of imitative learning and this is called cultural\n \n1\n\ntransmission.\nA component of advertising relies on the marketer's ability to tap into the brain’s propensity\nfor imitation. Anybody who has watched TV knows advertisements are disproportionately\npopulated with attractive, successful looking individuals. If we are going to imitate\nsomeone, we are more inclined to imitate those who appear to be popular and appealing.\nAlthough not all researchers are convinced by the findings, a number of studies indicate\nthat some animals also imitate dominant members of their group. Primatologist Frans de\nWaal provides anecdotal evidence of preferential imitation among chimpanzees. He noted\nthat in one particular group the dominant male was hurt and was limping as a result. Soon\nunlikely if a non-dominant male had been injured.\nImitation is undoubtedly an invaluable ability, but often our propensity to imitate generalises\nindiscriminately, leading to poor decisions. When athlete Dick Fosbury revolutionised the\nhigh jump by jumping over the bar backward in 1968, imitators obviously copied his\njumping style, not his brand of sports shoes. However, today, sports people appear in\nadvertisements asking US to buy the laptops or sports drinks that they promote. Rationally,\nwe know these people's success did not depend on these products, so it seems our\npropensity to purchase products relates more to neural programs that evolved to\nencourage imitation of those further up the social ladder. Today , companies engage in\nstealth marketing campaigns in which people are paid to frequent bars or websites to\ncovertly promote certain products , Companies also perform studies in which they track the\neye movements of people viewing displays , and carefully craft names , packages and\njingles associated with their products. While we may like to believe that manipulation on a\ngrand scale would not be possible, that's not to say that advertising is innately harmful. To\nthe contrary, the marketing of products or ideas is essential to human culture. The point is\nthat we should ensure our choices reflect our actual goals and desires, and we must\ndistinguish between the dissemination of information which is for our own good, and our\nmanipulation for the benefit of companies\n \n2",
