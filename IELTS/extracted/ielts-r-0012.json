From Mexico City and New York, to Singapore and Tokyo, new solutions to this\nold problem are being proposed, Mailed and implemented with ever increasing speed. It is\nfeared that unless pollution reduction measures are able to keep pace with the continued\npressures of urban growth, air quality in many of the world’s major cities will deteriorate\nbeyond reason.\nB\nAction is being taken along several fronts: through new legislation, improved enforcement\nand innovative technology. In Los Angeles, state regulations are forcing manufacturers to\ntry to sell ever cleaner cars: their first of the cleanest, titled \"Zero Emission Vehicles’, hove\nto be available soon, since they are intended to make up 2 per cent of sales in 1997. Local\nauthorities in London are campaigning to be allowed to enforce anti-pollution lows\nthemselves; at present only the police have the power to do so, but they tend to be busy\nelsewhere. In Singapore, renting out toad space to users is the way of the future.\nC\nWhen Britain’s Royal Automobile Club monitored the exhausts of 60,000 vehicles, it found\nthat 12 per cent of them produced more than half the total pollution. Older cars were the\nworst offenders; though a sizeable number of quire new cars were also identified as gross\npolluters, they were simply badly tuned. California has developed a scheme to get these\ngross polluters off the streets: they offer a flat $700 for any old, run-down vehicle driven in\nby its owner. The aim is to remove the heaviest-polluting, most decrepit vehicles from the\nroads.\nD\nAs part of a European Union environmental programme, a London council is resting an\ninfra-red spectrometer from the University of Denver in Colorado. It gauges the pollution\nfrom a passing vehicle - more useful than the annual stationary rest that is the British\nstandard today - by bouncing a beam through the exhaust and measuring what gets\nblocked. The councils next step may be to link the system to a computerised video camera\nable to read number plates automatically.\nE\nThe effort to clean up cars may do little to cut pollution if nothing is done about the\ntendency to drive them more. Los Angeles has some of the world’s cleanest cars - far\nbetter than those of Europe - but the total number of miles those cars drive continues to\ngrow. One solution is car-pooling, an arrangement in which a number of people who share\nthe same destination share the use of one car. However, the average number of people in\no car on the freeway in Los Angeles, which is 1.0, has been falling steadily. Increasing it\nwould be an effective way of reducing emissions as well as easing congestion. The trouble\n \n1\n\nis, Los Angeles  seem to like being alone in their cars.\nF\nSingapore has for a while had o scheme that forces drivers to buy a badge if they wish to\nvisit a certain part of the city. Electronic innovations make possible increasing\nsophistication: rates can vary according to road conditions, time of day and so on.\nSingapore is advancing in this direction, with a city-wide network of transmitters to collect\ninformation and charge drivers as they pass certain points. Such road-pricing, however,\ncan be controversial. When the local government in Cambridge, England, considered\nintroducing Singaporean techniques, it faced vocal and ultimately successful opposition.\nPart Two\nThe scope of the problem facing the world’s cities is immense. In 1992, the United Nations\nEnvironmental Programme and the World Health Organisation (WHO) concluded that all of\na sample of twenty megacities - places likely to have more than ten million inhabitants in\nthe year 2000 - already exceeded the level the WHO deems healthy in at least one major\npollutant. Two-thirds of them exceeded the guidelines for two, seven for three or more.\nOf the six pollutants monitored by the WHO - carbon dioxide, nitrogen dioxide, ozone,\nsulphur dioxide, lead and particulate matter - it is this last category that is attracting the\nmost attention from health researchers. PM10, a sub-category of particulate matter\nmeasuring ten-millionths of a metre across, has been implicated in thousands of deaths a\nyear in Britain alone. Research being conducted in two counties of Southern California is\nreaching similarly disturbing conclusions concerning this little- understood pollutant.\nA world-wide rise in allergies, particularly asthma, over the past four decades is now said to\nbe linked with increased air pollution. The lungs and brains of children who grow up in\npolluted air offer further evidence of its destructive power The old and ill, however, are the\nmost vulnerable to the acute effects of heavily polluted stagnant air. It con actually hasten\ndeath, os it did in December 1991 when a cloud of exhaust fumes lingered over the city of\nLondon for over a week.\nThe United Nations has estimated that in the year 2000 there will be twenty-four mega-\ncities and a further eighty-five cities of more than three million people. The pressure on\npublic officials, corporations and urban citizens to reverse established trends in air pollution\nis likely to grow in proportion with the growth of cities themselves. Progress is being made.\nThe question, though, remains the same: ‘Will change happen quickly enough?’\n \n2",
