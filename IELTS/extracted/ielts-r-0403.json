  "passage_text": "Reading Practice\n \nSpace Travel and Health\nA. Space biomedicine is a relatively new area of research both in the USA and in Europe.\nIts main objectives are to study the effects of space travel on the human body, identifying\nthe most critical medical problems, and finding solutions to those problems. Space\nbiomedicine centers are receiving increasing direct support from NASA and/or the\nEuropean Space Agency (ESA).\n \nB. This involvement of NASA and the ESA reflects growing concern that the feasibility of\ntravel to other planets, and beyond, is no longer limited by engineering constraints but by\nwhat the human body can actually withstand. The discovery of ice on Mars, for instance,\nmeans that there is now no necessity to design and develop a spacecraft large and\npowerful enough to transport the vast amounts of water needed to sustain the crew\nthroughout journeys that may last many years. Without the necessary protection and\nmedical treatment, however, their bodies would be devastated by the unremittingly hostile\nenvironment of space.\nC. The most obvious physical changes undergone by people in zero gravity are essentially\nharmless; in some cases, they are even amusing. The blood and other fluids are no longer\ndragged down towards the feet by the gravity of Earth, so they accumulate higher up in the\nbody, creating what is sometimes called ‘fat face`, together with the contrasting ‘chicken\nlegs’ syndrome as the lower limbs become thinner.\nD. Much more serious are the unseen consequences after months or years in space. With\nno gravity, there is less need for a sturdy skeleton to support the body, with the result that\nthe bones weaken, releasing calcium into the bloodstream. This extra calcium can overload\nthe kidneys, leading ultimately to renal failure. Muscles too lose strength through lack of\nuse. The heart becomes smaller, losing the power to pump oxygenated blood to all parts of\nthe body, while the lungs lose the capacity to breathe fully. The digestive system becomes\nless efficient, a weakened immune system is increasingly unable to prevent diseases and\nthe high levels of solar and cosmic radiation can cause various forms of cancer.\n \nE. To make matters worse, a wide range of medical difficulties can arise in the case of an\naccident or serious illness when the patient is millions of kilometers from Earth. There is\nsimply not enough room available inside a space vehicle to include all the equipment from\na hospital’s casualty unit, some of which would not work properly in space anyway. Even\nbasic things such as a drip depend on gravity to function, while standard resuscitation\ntechniques become ineffective if sufficient weight cannot be applied. The only solution\nseems to be to create extremely small medical tools and ‘smart` devices that can, for\nexample, diagnose and treat internal injuries using ultrasound. The cost of designing and\nproducing this kind of equipment is bound to be, well, astronomical.\nF. Such considerations have led some to question the ethics of investing huge sums of\nmoney to help a handful of people who, after all, are willingly risking their own health in\nouter space, when so much needs to be done a lot closer to home. It is now clear,\nhowever, that every problem of space travel has a parallel problem on Earth that will\nbenefit from the knowledge gained and the skills developed from space biomedical\n \n1\n\nresearch. For instance, the very difficulty of treating astronauts in space has led to rapid\nprogress in the field of telemedicine, which in turn has brought about developments that\nenable surgeons to communicate with patients in inaccessible parts of the world. To take\nanother example, systems invented to sterilize wastewater onboard spacecraft could be\nused by emergency teams to filter contaminated water at the scene of natural disasters\nsuch as floods and earthquakes. In the same way, miniature monitoring equipment,\ndeveloped to save weight in space capsules, will eventually become tiny monitors that\npatients on Earth can wear without discomfort wherever they go.\nG. Nevertheless, there is still one major obstacle to carrying out studies into the effects of\nspace travel: how to do so without going to the enormous expense of actually working in\nspace. To simulate conditions in zero gravity, one tried and tested method is to work\nunderwater, but the space biomedicine centers are also looking at other ideas. In one\nexperiment, researchers study the weakening of bones that results from prolonged\ninactivity. This would involve volunteers staying in bed for three months, but the center\nconcerned is confident there should be no great difficulty in finding people willing to spend\ntwelve weeks lying down.AII in the name of science, of course.\n \n2",
