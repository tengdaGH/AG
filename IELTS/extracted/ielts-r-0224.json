  "passage_text": "Reading Practice\n \nIn search of the holy grail\nIt has been called the Holy Grail of modern biology. Costing more than £2 billion, it is the\nmost ambitious scientific project since the Apollo programme that landed a man on the\nmoon. And it will take longer to accomplish than the lunar missions, for it will not be\ncomplete until early next century. Even before it is finished, according to those involved,\nthis project should open up new understanding of, and new treatments for, many of the\nailments that afflict humanity. As a result of the Human Genome Project, there will be new\nhope of liberation from the shadows of cancer, heart disease, autoimmune diseases such\nas rheumatoid arthritis, and some psychiatric illnesses.\nThe objective of the Human Genome Project is simple to state, but audacious in scope: to\nmap and analyse every single gene within the double helix of humanity's DNA1. The\nproject will reveal a new human anatomy — not the bones, muscles and sinews, but the\ncomplete genetic blueprint for a human being. Those working on the Human Genome\nProject claim that the new genetical anatomy will transform medicine and reduce human\nsuffering in the twenty-first century. But others see the future through a darker glass, and\nfear that the project may open the door to a world peopled by Frankenstein's monsters and\ndisfigured by a new eugenics2.\nThe genetic inheritance a baby receives from its parents at the moment of conception fixes\nmuch of its later development, determining characteristics as varied as whether it will have\nblue eyes or suffer from a life- threatening illness such as cystic fibrosis. The human\ngenome is the compendium of all these inherited genetic instructions. Written out along the\ndouble helix of DNA are the chemical letters of the genetic text, it is an extremely long text,\nfor the human genome contains more than 3 billion letters:\nOn the printed page it would fill about 7,000 volumes. Yet, within little more than a decade,\nthe position of every letter and its relation to its neighbours will have been tracked down,\nanalysed and recorded.\nConsidering how many letters there are in the human genome, nature is an excellent proof-\nreader. But sometimes there are mistakes. An error in a single 'word' — a gene - can give\nrise to the crippling condition of cystic fibrosis, the commonest genetic disorder among\nCaucasians. Errors in the genetic recipe for haemoglobin, the protein that gives blood its\ncharacteristic red colour and which carries oxygen from the lungs to the rest of the body,\ngive rise to the most common single gene disorder in the world: thalassaemia. More than\n4,000 such single-gene defects are known to afflict humanity.\nThe majority of them are fatal; the majority of the victims are children.\nNone of the single-gene disorders is a disease in the conventional sense, for which it would\nbe possible to administer a curative drug: the defect is pre-programmed into every cell of\nthe sufferer's body. But there is hope of progress. In 1986,. American researchers identified\nthe genetic defect underlying one type of muscular dystrophy. In 1989, a team of American\nand Canadian biologists announced that they had found the site of the gene which, when\ndefective, gives rise to cystic fibrosis. Indeed, not only had they located the gene, they had\nanalysed the sequence of letters within it and had identified the mistake responsible for the\ncondition. At the least, these scientific advances may offer a way of screening parents who\nmight be at risk of transmitting a single-gene defect to any children that they conceive.\n \n1\n\nFoetuses can be tested while in the womb, and if found free of the genetic defect, the\nparents will be relieved of worry and stress, knowing that they will be delivered of a baby\nfree from the disorder.\nIn the mid-1980s, the idea gained currency within the scientific world that the techniques\nwhich were successfully deciphering disorder-related genes could be applied to a larger\nproject: if science can learn the genetic spelling of cystic fibrosis, why not attempt to find\nout how to spell 'human'? Momentum quickly built up behind the Human Genome Project\nand its objective of 'sequencing' the entire genome - writing out all the letters in their correct\norder.\nBut the consequences of the Human Genome Project go far beyond a narrow focus on\ndisease. Some of its supporters have made claims of great extravagance - that the Project\nwill bring us to understand, at the most fundamental level, what it is to be human. Yet many\npeople are concerned that such an emphasis on humanity's genetic constitution may distort\nour sense of values, and lead us to forget that human life is more than just the expression\nof a genetic program written in the chemistry of DNA.\nIf properly applied, the new knowledge generated by the Human Genome Project may free\nhumanity from the terrible scourge of diverse diseases. But if the new knowledge is not\nused wisely, it also holds the threat of creating new forms of discrimination and new\nmethods of oppression. Many characteristics, such as height and intelligence, result not\nfrom the action of genes alone, but from subtle interactions between genes and the\nenvironment. What would be the implications if humanity were to understand, with\nprecision, the genetic constitution which, given the same environment, will predispose one\nperson towards a higher intelligence than another individual whose genes were differently\nshuffled?\nOnce before in this century, the relentless curiosity of scientific researchers brought to light\nforces of nature in the power of the atom, the mastery of which has shaped the destiny of\nnations and overshadowed all our lives. The Human Genome Project holds the promise\nthat, ultimately, we may be able to alter our genetic inheritance if we so choose. But there\nis the central moral problem: how can we ensure that when we choose, we choose\ncorrectly? That such a potential is a promise and not a threat? We need only look at the\npast to understand the danger.\n----------\n \nGlossary\n \n \n1 DNA Deoxyribonucleic acid, molecules responsible for the transference of\ngenetic characteristics.\n2 eugenics The science of improving the qualities of the human race, especially the careful\nselection of parents.\n \n2",
