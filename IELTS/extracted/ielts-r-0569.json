  "passage_text": "Reading Practice\n \nThe vikings wayfaring way\nIn the last century, Vikings have been perceived in numerous dierent ways – vilified as\nconquerors and romanticised as adventurers. How Vikings have been employed in nation-\nbuilding is a topic of some interest.\nIn English, Vikings are also known as Norse or Norsemen. Their language greatly inuenced\nEnglish, with the nouns, ‘Hell’, ‘husband’, ‘law’, and ‘window’, and the verbs, ‘blunder’,\n‘snub’, ‘take’, and ‘want’, all coming from Old Norse. However, the origins of the word\n‘Viking’, itself, are obscure: it may mean ‘a Scandinavian pirate’, or it may refer to ‘an inlet’,\nor a place called Vik, in modem-day Norway, from where the pirates came. These various\nnames – Vikings, Norse, or Norsemen, and doubts about the very word ‘Viking’ suggest\nhistorical confusion.\nLoosely speaking, the Viking Age endured from the late eighth to the mid-eleventh\ncenturies. Vikings sailed to England in AD 793 to storm coastal monasteries, and\nsubsequently, large swathes of England fell under Viking rule – indeed several Viking kings\nsat on the English throne. It is generally agreed that the Battle of Hastings, in 1066, when\nthe Norman French invaded, marks the end of the English Viking Age, but the Irish Viking\nage ended earlier, while Viking colonies in Iceland and Greenland did not dissolve until\naround AD 1500.\nHow much territory Vikings controlled is also in dispute – Scandinavia and Western Europe\ncertainly, but their reach east and south is uncertain. They plundered and settled down the\nVolga and Dnieper rivers, and traded with modem-day Istanbul, but the archaeological\nrecord has yet to verify that Vikings raided as far away as Northwest Africa, as some\nwriters claim.\nThe issue of control and extent is complex because many Vikings did not return to\nScandinavia after raiding but assimilated into local populations, often becoming Christian.\nTo some degree, the Viking Age is defined by religion. Initially, Vikings were polytheists,\nbelieving in many gods, but by the end of the age, they had permanently accepted a new\nmonotheistic religious system – Christianity.\nThis transition from so-called pagan plunderers to civilised Christians is significant and is\nthe view promulgated throughout much of recent history. In the UK, in the 1970s for\nexample, schoolchildren were taught that until the Vikings accepted Christianity they were\nnasty heathens who rampaged throughout Britain. By contrast, today’s children can visit\nmuseums where Vikings are celebrated as merchants, pastoralists, and artists with a\nunique worldview as well as conquerors.\nWhat are some other interpretations of Vikings? In the nineteenth century, historians in\nDenmark, Norway, and Sweden constructed their own Viking ages for nationalistic reasons.\nAt that time, all three countries were in crisis. Denmark had been beaten in war and ceded\nterritory to what is now Germany. Norway had become independent from Sweden in 1905\nbut was economically vulnerable, so Norwegians sought to create a separate identity for\nthemselves in the past as well as the present. The Norwegian historian, Gustav Storm, was\nadamant it was his forebears and not the Swedes’ or Danes’ who had colonised Iceland,\nGreenland, and Vinland, in what is now Canada. Sweden, meanwhile, had relinquished\nNorway to the Norwegians and Finland to the Russians; thus, in the late nineteenth\n \n1\n\ncentury, Sweden was keen to boost its image with rich archaeological finds to show the\nglory of its Viking past.\nIn addition to augmenting nationalism, nineteenth-century thinkers were influenced by an\nEnglishman, Herbert Spencer, who described peoples and cultures in evolutionary terms\nsimilar to those of Charles Darwin. Spencer coined the phrase ‘survival of the fittest’, which\nincludes the notion that, over time, there is not only technological but also moral progress.\nTherefore, Viking heathens’ adoption of Christianity was considered an advantageous\nmove. These days, historians do not compare cultures in the same way, especially since, in\nthis case, the archaeological record seems to show that heathen Vikings and Christian\nEuropeans were equally brutal.\nViews of Vikings change according to not only to forces aecting historians at the time of\ntheir research but also according to the materials they read. Since much knowledge of\nVikings comes from literature composed up to 300 years after the events they chronicle,\nsome Danish historians cal1 these sources ‘mere legends’.\nVikings did have a written language carved on large stones, but as few of these survive\ntoday, the most reliable contemporary sources on Vikings come from writers from other\ncultures, like the ninth-century Persian geographer, Ibn Khordadbeh.\nIn the last four decades, there have been wildly varying interpretations of the Viking\ninuence in Russia. Most non-Russian scholars believe the Vikings created a kingdom in\nwestern Russia and modern-day Ukraine led by a man called Rurik. After AD 862, Rurik’s\ndescendants continued to rule. There is considerable evidence of this colonisation: in\nSweden, carved stones, still standing, describe the conquerors’ journeys; both Russian and\nUkrainian have loan words from Old Norse; and, Scandinavian first names, like Igor and\nOlga, are still popular. However, during the Soviet period, there was an emphasis on the\nSlavic origins of most Russians. (Appearing in the historical record around the sixth century\nAD, the Slavs are thought to have originated in Eastern Europe.) This Slavic identity was\npromoted to contrast with that of the neighbouring Viking Swedes, who were enemies\nduring the Cold War.\nThese days, many Russians consider themselves hybrids. Indeed recent genetic studies\nsupport a Norse-colonisation theory: western Russian DNA is consistent with that of the\ninhabitants of a region north of Stockholm in Sweden.\nThe tools available to modern historians are many and varied, and their findings may seem\nless open to debate. There are linguistics, numismatics, dendrochronology,\narchaeozoology, palaeobotany, ice crystallography, climate and DNA analysis to add to the\ntranslation of runes and the raising of mighty warships. Despite these, historians remain\nchildren of their times.\n \n2",
