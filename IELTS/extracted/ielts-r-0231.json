  "passage_text": "Reading Practice\n \nIS AID HURTING AFRICA?\nDespite its population of more than one billion and its rich land and natural resources, the\ncontinent of Africa remains poor. The combined economies of its 54 states equal that of\none European country: the Netherlands.\nIt is difficult to speak of Africa as a unit as its states differ from each other in culture,\nclimate, size, and political system. Since mid-20th-century independence, many African\nstates have pursued different economic policies. Yet, none of them has overcome poverty.\nWhy might this be?\nOne theory says Africa is unlucky. Sparsely populated with diverse language and culture, it\ncontains numerous landlocked countries, and it is far from international markets. Dambisa\nMoyo, a Zambian-born economist, has another theory. In her 2009 book, Dead Aid, she\nproposes that international aid is largely to blame for African poverty because it has\nencouraged dependence and corruption, and has diverted talented people from the\nbusiness. One of her statistics is that from 1970-98, when aid to Africa was highest, poverty\nrose from eleven to 66%. If aid were cut, she believes Africans would utilise their resources\nmore creatively. \nWhen a state lacks the capacity to care for its people, international non-governmental\norganisations (NGOs), like Oxfam or the Red Cross, assume this role. While NGOs\ndistribute food or medical supplies, Moyo argues they reduce the ability of the state to\nprovide. Furthermore, during this process, those in government and the military siphon off\naid goods and money themselves. Transparency International, an organisation that surveys\ncorruption, rates the majority of African states poorly.\nMoyo provides another example. Maybe a Hollywood star donates American-made\nmosquito nets. Certainly, this benefits malaria-prone areas, but it also draws business\naway from local African traders who supply nets. More consultation is needed between do-\ngooder foreigners and local communities.\nMoyo also suggests African nations increase their wealth by investment in bonds, or by\nincreased co-operation with China.\n \nThe presidents of Rwanda and Senegal are strong supporters of Moyo, but critics say her\ntheories are simplistic. The international aid community is not responsible for geography,\nnor has it anything to do with the military takeover, corruption, or legislation that hampers\ntrade. Africans have had half a century of self-government and economic control, yet, as\nthe population of the continent doubled, its GDP has risen only 60%. In the same period,\nMalaysia and Vietnam threw off colonialism and surged ahead economically by investing in\neducation, health, and infrastructure; by lowering taxes on international trade; and, by\nbeing fortunate to be surrounded by other successful nations.\nThe economist Paul Collier has speculated that if aid were cut, African governments would\nnot find alternative sources of income, nor would they reduce corruption. Another\neconomist, Jeffrey Sachs, has calculated that twice the amount of aid currently given is\nneeded to prevent suffering on a grand scale.\n \n1\n\nIn Dead Aid, Moyo presents her case through a fictitious country called ‘Dongo’, but\nnowhere does she provide examples of real aid organisations causing actual problems. Her\napproach may be entertaining, but it is hardly academic.\nOther scholars point out that Africa is dominated by tribal societies with military-government\nelites. Joining the army, rather than doing business, was the easiest route to personal\nwealth and power. Unsurprisingly, military takeovers have occurred in almost every African\ncountry. In the 1960s and 70s, European colonials were replaced by African ‘colonials’ –\nAfrican generals and their families. Meantime, the very small, educated bourgeoisie has\nmoved abroad. All over Africa, strongmen leaders have ruled for a long time, or one\nunstable military regime has succeeded another. As a result, business, separate from the\nmilitary government is rare, and international investment limited.\nPost-secondary education rates are low in Africa. Communications and transportation\nremain basic although mobile phones are having an impact. The distances farmers must\ntravel to market are vast due to poor roads. High cross-border taxes and long bureaucratic\ndelays are par for the course. African rural populations exceed those elsewhere in the\nworld. Without a decent infrastructure or an educated urbanised workforce, a business\ncannot prosper. Recent World Bank statistics show that in southern Africa, the number of\ncompanies using the internet for business is 20% as opposed to 40% in South America or\n80% in the US. There are 37 days each year without water whereas there is less than one\nday in Europe. The average cost of sending one container to the US is $7600, but only\n$3900 from East Asia or the Pacific. All these problems are the result of poor state\nplanning. \nGreat ethnic and linguistic diversity within African countries has led to tribal favouritism.\nGovernments are often controlled by one tribe or allied tribes; civil war is usually tribal. It is\nestimated each civil war costs a country roughly $64 billion. Southern Africa had 34 such\nconflicts from 1940-2000 while South Asia, the next-affected region, had only 24 in the\nsame period. To this day, a number of bloody conflicts continue.\nOther opponents of Moyo add that her focus on market investment and more business with\nChina is shortsighted. The 2008 financial crisis meant that countries with market\ninvestments lost money. Secondly, China’s real intentions in Africa are unknown, but\neveryone can see China is buying up African farmland and securing cheap oil supplies.\nAll over Africa, there are untapped resources, but distance, diversity, and low population\ndensity contribute to poverty. Where there is no TV, infrequent electricity, and bad roads,\nthere still seems to be money for automatic weapons just the right size for 12-year-old boys\nto use. Blaming the West for assisting with aid fails to address the issues of continuous\nconflict, ineffective government, and little infrastructure. Nor does it prevent terrible\nsuffering.\nHas aid caused problems for Africa, or is Africa’s strife of its own making or due to\ngeography? Whatever you think, Dambisa Moyo’s book has generated lively discussion,\nwhich is fruitful for Africa.\n \n2",
