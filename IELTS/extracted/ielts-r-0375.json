INCREASED TEMPERATURES\nThe average air temperature at the surface of the earth has risen this century, as has the\ntemperature of ocean surface waters. Because water expands as it heats, a warmer ocean\nmeans higher sea levels. We cannot say definitely that the temperature rises are due to the\ngreenhouse effect; the heating may be part of a “natural” variability over a long time-scale\nthat we have not yet recognized I our short 100 years of recording. However, assuming the\nbuild up of greenhouse gases is responsible, and that the warming will continue. Scientists\nand inhabitants of low-lying coastal areas would like to know the extent of future sea level\nrises.\nParagraph 2.\nCalculating this is not easy. Models used for the purpose have treated the oceans as\npassive, stationary and one-dimensional. Scientists have assumed that heat simply\ndiffused into the sea from the atmosphere. Using basic physical laws, they then predict how\nmuch a known volume of water would expand for a given increase in temperature. But the\noceans are not one-dimensional, and recent work by oceanographers, using a new model\nwhich takes into account a number of subtle facets of the sea-including vast and complex\nocean currents-suggests that the rise in sea level may be less than some earlier estimates\nhad predicted.\nParagraph 3\nAn international forum on climate change, in 1986, produced figures for likely sea-level\nrises of 20 cm and 1.4 m, corresponding to atmospheric temperature increases of 1.5 and\n4.5C respectively. Some scientists estimate that the ocean warming resulting from those\ntemperature increases by the year 2050 would raise the sea level by between 10 cm and\n40 cm. This model only takes into account the temperature effect on the oceans; it does not\nconsider changes in sea level brought about by the melting of ice sheets and glaciers, and\nchanges in groundwater storage. When we add on estimates of these, we arrive at figures\nfor total sea-level rises of 15 cm and 70 cm respectively.\nParagraph 4\nIt’s not easy trying to model accurately the enormous complexities of the ever-changing\noceans, with their great volume, massive currents and sensitively to the influence of land\nmasses and the atmosphere. For example, consider how heat enters the ocean. Does it\njust “diffuse” from the warmer air vertically into the water, and heat only the surface layer of\nthe sea? (Warm water is less dense than cold, so it would not spread downwards).\nConventional models of sea-level rise have considered that this the only method, but\nmeasurements have shown that the rate of heat transfer into the ocean by vertical diffusion\nis far lower in practice than the figures that many models have adopted.\nParagraph 5\nMuch of the early work, for simplicity, ignored the fact that water in the oceans moves in\nthree dimensions. By movement, of course, scientists don’t mean waves, which are too\nsmall individually to consider, but rather movement of vast volumes of water in huge\n \n1\n\ncurrents. To understand the importance of this, we now need to consider another process-\nadvection. Imagine smoke rising from a chimney. On a still day it will slowly spread out in\nall directions by means of diffusion. With a strong directional wind, however, it will all shift\ndownwind, this process is advection-the transport of properties (notably heat and salinity in\nocean) by the movement of bodies of air or water, rather than by conduction or diffusion.\nParagraph 6\nMassive oceans current called gyres do the moving. These currents have far more capacity\nto store heat than does the atmosphere. Indeed, just the top 3 m of the ocean contains\nmore heat than the whole of the atmosphere. The origin of the gyres lies in the fact that\nmore heat from the Sun reaches the Equator than the Poles, and naturally heat trends to\nmove from the former to the latter. Warm air rises at the Equator, and draws more air\nbeneath it in the form of winds (the “Trade Winds\") that, together with other air movements,\nprovide the main force driving the ocean currents.\nParagraph 7\nWater itself is heated at the Equator and moves poleward, twisted by the Earth’s rotation\nand affected by the positions of the continents. The resultant broadly circular movements\nbetween about 10 and 40 ' North and South are clockwise in the Southern Hemisphere.\nThey flow towards the east at mind latitudes in the equatorial region. They then flow\ntowards the Poles, along the eastern sides of continents, as warm currents. When two\ndifferent masses of water meet, once will move beneath the other, depending on their\nrelative densities in the subduction process. The densities are determined by temperature\nand salinity. The convergence of water of different densities from the Equator and\nthe Poles deep in the oceans causes continuous subduction. This means that water moves\nvertically as well as horizontally. Cold water from the Poles travels as depth-it is denser\nthan warm water-until it emerges at the surface in another part of the world in the form of a\ncold current.\nParagraph 8. HOW THE GREENHOUSE EFFECTS WILL CHANGE OCEAN\nTEMPERATURES\nOcean currents, in three dimensions, from a giant “conveyor belt”, distributing heat from the\nthin surface layer into the interior of the oceans and around the globe. Water may take\ndecades to circulate in these 3-D gyres in the lop kilometer of the ocean, and centuries in\nthe deep water. With the increased atmospheric temperatures due to the greenhouse\neffect, the oceans conveyor belt will carry more heat into the interior. This subduction\nmoves heat around far more effectively than simple diffusion. Because warm water\nexpands more than cold when it is heated, scientists had presumed that the sea level\nwould rise unevenly around the globe. It is now believed that these inequalities\ncannot persist, as winds will act to continuously spread out the water expansion. Of course,\nof global warming changes the strength and distribution of the winds, then this “evening-\nout” process may not occur, and the sea level could rise more in some areas than others.\n \n2",
