  "passage_text": "Reading Practice\n \nThe power of the big screen\nA\nThe Lumière Brothers opened their Cinématographe, at 14 Boulevard des Capucines in\nParis, to 100 paying customers over 100 years ago, on December 8, 1895. Before the eyes\nof the stunned, thrilled audience, photographs came to life and moved across a flat screen.\nB\nSo ordinary and routine has this become to us that it takes a determined leap of\nthe imagination to grasp the impact of those first moving images. But it is worth trying, for\nto understand the initial shock of those images is to understand the extraordinary\npower and magic of cinema, the unique, hypnotic quality that has made film the most\ndynamic, effective art form of the 20th century.\nC\nOne of the Lumière Brothers' earliest films was a 30-second piece which showed a section\nof a railway platform flooded with sunshine. A train appears and heads straight for the\ncamera. And that is all that happens. Yet the Russian director Andrei Tarkovsky, one of the\ngreatest of all film artists, described the film as a 'work of genius'. 'As the train approached,'\nwrote Tarkovsky, 'panic started in the theatre: people jumped and ran away. That was the\nmoment when cinema was born. The frightened audience could not accept that they were\nwatching a mere picture. Pictures were still, only reality moved; this must, therefore, be\nreality. In their confusion, they feared that a real train was about to crush them.'\nD\nEarly cinema audiences often experienced the same confusion. In time, the idea of film\nbecame familiar, the magic was accepted -but it never stopped being magic. Film has\nnever lost its unique power to embrace its audiences and transport them to a\ndifferent world. For Tarkovsky, the key to that magic was the way in which cinema created\na dynamic image of the real flow of events. A still picture could only imply the existence\nof time, while time in a novel passed at the whim of the reader. But in cinema, the\nreal, objective flow of time was captured.\nE\nOne effect of this realism was to educate the world about itself. For cinema makes\nthe world smaller. Long before people travelled to America or anywhere else, they\nknew what other places looked like; they knew how other people worked and\nlived. Overwhelmingly, the lives recorded - at least in film fiction — have been American.\nFrom the earliest days of the industry, Hollywood has dominated the world film\nmarket. American imagery - the cars, the cities, the cowboys - became the primary imagery\nof film. Film carried American life and values around the globe.\nF\nAnd, thanks to film, future generations will know the 20th century more intimately than any\nother period. We can only imagine what life was like in the 14lh century or in\n \n1\n\nclassical Greece. But the life of the modern world has been recorded on film in\nmassive, encyclopaedic detail. We shall be known better than any preceding generations.\nG\nThe 'star' was another natural consequence of cinema. The cinema star was effectively\nborn in 1910. Film personalities have such an immediate presence that, inevitably,\nthey become super-real. Because we watch them so closely and because everybody in\nthe world seems to know who they are, they appear more real to us than we do\nourselves. The star as magnified human self is one of cinema's most strange and\nenduring legacies.\nH\nCinema has also given a new lease of life to the idea of the story. When the\nLumière Brothers and other pioneers began showing off this new invention, it was by no\nmeans obvious how it would be used. All that mattered at first was the wonder\nof movement. Indeed, some said that, once this novelty had worn off, cinema would\nfade away. It was no more than a passing gimmick, a fairground attraction.\nI\nCinema might, for example, have become primarily a documentary form. Or it might have\ndeveloped like television - as a strange, noisy transfer of music, information and narrative.\nBut what happened was that it became, overwhelmingly, a medium for telling stories.\nOriginally these were conceived as short stories - early producers doubted the ability of\naudiences to concentrate for more than the length of a reel. Then, in 1912, an Italian 2-hour\nfilm was hugely successful, and Hollywood settled upon the novel-length narrative that\nremains the dominant cinematic convention of today.\nJ\n \nAnd it has all happened so quickly. Almost unbelievably, it is a mere 100 years since that\ntrain arrived and the audience screamed and fled, convinced by the dangerous reality of\nwhat they saw, and, perhaps, suddenly aware that the world could never be the same\nagain - that, maybe, it could be better, brighter, more astonishing, more real than reality.\n \n2",
