Parrots are found across the tropic and in all southern hemisphere continents except\nAntarctica, but nowhere do the display such a richness of diversity and form as in Australia.\nOne- sixth of the world’s 345 parrot species are found there, and Australia has long been\nrenowned for the number and variety of its parrots.\nB. In the 16th century, the German cartographer Mercator made a world map that included\na place, somewhere near present-day Australia, that he named Terra Psittacorum – the\nLand of Parrots – and the first European settlers in Australia often referred to the country\nas Parrot Land. In 1865, the celebrated British naturalist and wildlife artist John Gould said:\n“No group of birds gives Australia so tropical and benign an air as the numerous species of\nthis great family by which it is tenanted.\nC. Parrots are descendants of an ancient line. Due to their great diversity, and since most\nspecies inhabit Africa, Australia and South America, it seems almost certain that parrots\noriginated millions of years ago on the ancient southern continent of Gondwana, before it\nbroke up into the separate southern hemisphere continents we know today. Much of\nGondwana comprised vast rainforests intersected by huge slow-flowing rivers and\nexpansive lakes, but by eight million years ago, great changes were underway. The center\nof the continent of Australia had begun to dry out, and the rainforests that once covered it\ngradually contracted to the continental margins, where, to a limited extent, they still exist\ntoday. \nD. The creatures that remained in those shrinking rainforests had to adapt to the drier\nconditions or face extinction. Reacting to these desperate circumstances, the parrot family,\ntypically found in jungles in other parts of the world, has populated some of Australia’s\nharshest environments. The parrots spread from ancestral forests through eucalypt\nwoodlands to colonies the central deserts of Australia, and as a consequence they\ndiversified into a wide range of species with adaptations that reflect the many changes\nanimals and plants had to make to survive in these areas.\nE. These evolutionary pressures helped mould keratin, the substance from which breaks\nare made into a range of tools capable of gathering the new food types favored by various\nspecies of parrot. The size of a parrot’s short, blunt beak and the length of that beak’s do\ncurved upper section are related to the type of food each species eats. Some have\ncomparatively long beaks that are perfect for extracting seeds from fruit; others have\nbroader and stronger beaks that are designed for cracking hard seeds.\nF. Differently shaped beaks are not the only adaptations that have been made during the\ndeveloping relationship between parrots and their food plants. Like all of Australia’s many\nhoney eating birds, the rainbow-coloured lorikeets and the flowers on which they feed have\nlong coevolved with features such as the shape and colour of the flowers adapted to the\nbird’s particular needs, and physical a example, red is the most I attractive colour to birds,\nand thus flowers which depend on birds for pollination are more often red, and lorikeets’ to\ngues have bristles which help them to collect as much pollen as possible.\nG. Today, most of Australia’s parrots inhabit woodland and open forest, and their numbers\n \n1\n\ndecline towards both deserts and wetter areas. The majority are nomadic to some degree,\nmoving around to take advantage of feeding and breeding places. Two of the dry country\nparrots, the pink and grey galah and the pink, white and yellow corella have expanded their\nranges in recent years. They are among the species that have adapted well to the changes\nbrought about by European settlement forest telling created grasslands where galahs and\ncorellas thrive.\nH. But other parrot species did not fare so well when their environments were altered. The\nclearing of large areas of rainforest is probably responsible for the disappearance of the\ndouble-eyed fig parrot, and numbers of ground parrots declined when a great part of their\nhabitat was destroyed by the draining of coastal swamps. Even some parrot species that\nbenefited from forest clearing at first are now comforted by a shortage of nesting sites due\nto further man-made changes.\nI. New conditions also sometimes favour an incoming species over one that originally\ninhabited the area. For example, after farmers cleared large areas of forest on Kangaroo\nIsland off the coast of South Australia, the island was colonised by galahs. They were soon\ngoing down holes and destroying black cockatoo eggs in order to take the hole for their\nown use. Their success precipitated a partial collapse in the black cockatoo population\nwhen the later lost the struggle for scarce nesting hollows. \nJ. There may be no final answer to ensuring an equitable balance between parrot species.\nNest box programmers help ease the shortage of nesting sites in some places, but there\nare not enough, they are expensive and they are not an adequate substitute by large, old\ntrees, such as the habitat they represent and nectar, pollen and seeds they provide.\nCompetition between parrots for nest sites is a result of the changes we humans have\nmade to the Earth. We are the most widespread and dangerous competitors that parrots\nhave ever had to face, but we also have the knowledge and skill to maintain the\nwonderfully rich diversity of Australia’s parrots. All we need is the wild to do so.\n \n2",
