  "passage_text": "Reading Practice\n \nTITAN of technology\nGordon Moore is the scientific brain behind Intel, the world’s biggest maker of computer\nchips. Both funny and self-deprecating, he’s a shrewd businessman too, but admits to\nbeing an ‘accidental entrepreneur’, happier in the back room trading ideas with techies than\nout selling the product or chatting up the stockholders. When he applied for a job at Dow\nChemical after gaining his PhD, the company psychologist ruled that 1 was okay\ntechnically, but that I’d never manage anything’. This year Intel is set to turn over $28\nbillion.\nWhen Moore co-founded Intel (short for Integrated Electronics) to develop integrated\ncircuits thirty-five years ago, he provided the motive force in R&D (Research &\nDevelopment) while his more extrovert partner Robert Noyce became the public face of the\ncompany. Intel’s ethos was distinctively Californian: laid- back, democratic, polo shirt and\nchinos. Moore worked in a cubicle like everyone else, never had a designated parking\nspace and flew Economy. None of this implied lack of ambition. Moore and Noyce shared a\nvision, recognising that success depended just as much on intellectual pizazz as on Intel’s\nability to deliver a product. Noyce himself received the first patent for an integrated circuit in\n1961, while both partners were learning the business of electronics at Fair child\nSemiconductor.\nFair child’s success put money in Moore and Noyce’s pockets, but they were starved of\nR&D money. They resigned, frustrated, to found Intel in 1968. ‘It was one of those rare\nperiods when money was available,’ says Moore. They put in $250,000 each and drummed\nup another $2.5m of venture capital ‘on the strength of a one-page business plan that said\nessentially nothing’. Ownership was divided 50:50 between founders and backers. Three\nyears later, Intel’s first microprocessor was released: the 4004, carrying 2,250 transistors.\nProgress after that was rapid. By the time the competition realised what was happening,\nIntel had amassed a seven-year R&D lead that it was never to relinquish.\nBy the year 2000, Intel’s Pentium-4 chip was carrying 42 million transistors. ‘Now,’ says\nMoore, ‘we put a quarter of a billion transistors on a chip and are looking forward to a billion\nin the near future.’ The performance gains have been phenomenal. The 4004 ran at 108\nkilohertz (108,000 hertz), the Pentium*4 at three gigahertz (3 billion hertz). It’s calculated\nthat if automobile speed had increased similarly over the same period, you could now drive\nfrom New York to San Francisco in six seconds.\nMoore’s prescience in forecasting this revolution is legendary. In 1965, while still head of\nthe R&D laboratory at Fair child, he wrote a piece for Electronics magazine observing ‘that\nover the first few years we had essentially doubled the complexity of integrated circuits\nevery year. I blindly extrapolated for the next ten years and said we’d go from about 60 to\nabout 60,000 transistors on a chip. It proved a much more spot-on prediction than I could\never have imagined, up until then, integrated circuits had been expensive and had had\nprincipally military applications. But I could see that the economics were going to switch\ndramatically. This was going to become the cheapest way to make electronics.’\nThe prediction that a chip’s transistor-count – and thus its performance – would keep\ndoubling every year soon proved so accurate that Carver Mead, a friend from Caltech,\ndubbed it ‘Moore’s Law’. The name has stuck. ‘Moore’s Law’ has become the yardstick by\nwhich the exponential growth of the computer industry has been measured ever since.\n \n1\n\nWhen, in 1975, Moore looked around him again and saw transistor-counts slowing, he\npredicted that in future chip-performance would double only every two years. But that\nproved pessimistic. Actual growth since then has split the difference between his two\npredictions, with performance doubling every 1 8 months.\nAnd there’s a corollary, says Moore. ‘If the cost of a given amount of computer power drops\n50 per cent every 1 8 months, each time that happens the market explodes with new\napplications that hadn’t been economical before.’ He sees the microprocessor as ‘almost\ninfinitely elastic’. As prices fall, new applications keep emerging: smart light bulbs, flashing\ntrainers or greetings cards that sing ‘Happy Birthday’. Where will it all stop? Well, it’s true,\nhe says, ‘that in a few more generations [of chips], the fact that materials are made of\natoms starts to be a real problem. Essentially, you can’t make things any smaller.’ But in\npractice, the day of reckoning is endlessly postponed as engineers find endlessly more\ningenious ways of loading more transistors on a chip. ‘I suspect I shared the feelings of\neverybody else that when we got to the dimensions of a micron [about 1986, we wouldn’t\nbe able to continue because we were touching the wavelength of light. But as we got\ncloser, the barriers just melted away,’\nWhen conventional chips finally reach their limits, nanotechnology beckons. Researchers\nare already working on sci-fi sounding alternatives such as molecular computers, built atom\nby atom, that theoretically could process hundreds of thousands times more information\nthan today’s processors. Quantum computers using the state of electrons as the basis for\ncalculation could operate still faster. On any measure, there looks to be plenty of life left in\nMoore’s Law yet.\n \n2",
