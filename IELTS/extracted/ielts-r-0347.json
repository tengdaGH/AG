  "passage_text": "Reading Practice\n \nPRIVATE SCHOOLS\nMost countries’ education systems have had what you might call educational disasters, but,\nsadly, in many areas of certain countries these ‘disasters’ are still evident today. The\nEnglish education system is unique due to the fact that there are still dozens of schools\nwhich are known as private schools and they perpetuate privilege and social division. Most\ncountries have some private schools for the children of the wealthy; England is able to\nmore than triple the average number globally. England has around 3,000 private schools\nand just under half a million children are educated at them whilst some nine million children\nare educated at state schools. The overwhelming majority of students at private schools\nalso come from middle-class families.\nThe result of this system is evident and it has much English history embedded within it. The\nfacts seem to speak for themselves. In the private system almost half the students go on to\nUniversity, whilst in the state system only about eight per cent make it to further education.\nHowever, statistics such as these can be deceptive due to the fact that middle-class\nchildren do better at examinations than working class ones, and most of them stay on at\nschool after 16. Private schools therefore have the advantage over state schools as they\nare entirely ‘middle class’, and this creates an environment of success where students work\nharder and apply themselves more diligently to their school work.\nPrivate schools are extortionately expensive, being as much as £18,000 a year at\nsomewhere such as Harrow or Eton, where Princes William and Harry attended, and at\nleast £8,000 a year almost everywhere else. There are many parents who are not wealthy\nor even comfortably off but are willing to sacrifice a great deal in the cause of their\nchildren’s schooling. It baffles many people as to why they need to spend such vast\namounts when there are perfectly acceptable state schools that don’t cost a penny. One\nfather gave his reasoning for sending his son to a private school, ‘If my son gets a five-\npercent-better chance of going to University then that may be the difference between\nsuccess and failure.” It would seem to the average person that a £50,000 minimum total\ncost of second level education is a lot to pay for a five-percent-better chance. Most\nchildren, given the choice, would take the money and spend it on more enjoyable things\nrather than shelling it out on a school that is too posh for its own good\nHowever, some say that the real reason that parents fork out the cash is prejudice: they\ndon’t want their little kids mixing with the “workers”, or picking up an undesirable accent. In\naddition to this, it wouldn’t do if at the next dinner party all the guests were boasting about\nsending their kids to the same place where the son of the third cousin of Prince Charles is\ngoing, and you say your kid is going to the state school down the road, even if you could\npocket the money for yourself instead, and, as a result, be able to serve the best\nChampagne with the smoked salmon and duck.\nIt is a fact, however, that at many of the best private schools, your money buys you\nsomething. One school, with 500 pupils, has 11 science laboratories; another school with\n800 pupils, has 30 music practice rooms; another has 16 squash courts, and yet another\nhas its own beach. Private schools spend £300 per pupil a year on investment in buildings\nand facilities; the state system spends less than £50. On books, the ratio is 3 to 1.\nOne of the things that your money buys which is difficult to quantify is the appearance of\nthe school, the way it looks. Most private schools that you will find are set in beautiful, well-\n \n1\n\nkept country houses, with extensive grounds and gardens. In comparison with the state\nschools, they tend to look like castles, with the worst of the state schools looking like public\nlavatories, perhaps even tiled or covered in graffiti. Many may even have an architectural\ndesign that is just about on the level of an industrial shed.\n \n2",
