  "passage_text": "Reading Practice\n \nActivities for Children\nA Twenty-five years ago, children in London walked to school and played in parks and\nplaying fields after school and at the weekend. Today they are usually driven to school by\nparents anxious about safety and spend hours glued to television screens or computer\ngames. Meanwhile, community playing fields are being sold off to property developers at\nan alarming rate. ‘This change in lifestyle has, sadly, meant greater restrictions on\nchildren,’ says Neil Armstrong, Professor of Health and Exercise Sciences at the University\nof Exeter. ‘If children continue to be this inactive, they’ll be storing up big problems for the\nfuture.’\nB In 1985, Professor Armstrong headed a five-year research project into children’s fitness.\nThe results, published in 1990, were alarming. The survey, which monitored 700 11-16-\nyear-olds, found that 48 per cent of girls and 41 per cent of boys already exceeded safe\ncholesterol levels set for children by the American Heart Foundation. Armstrong adds,\n“heart is a muscle and need exercise, or it loses its strength.” It also found that 13 per cent\nof boys and 10 per cent of girls were overweight. More disturbingly, the survey found that\nover a four-day period, half the girls and one-third of the boys did less exercise than the\nequivalent of a brisk 10-minute walk. High levels of cholesterol, excess body fat and\ninactivity are believed to increase the risk of coronary heart disease.\nC Physical education is under pressure in the UK – most schools devote little more than\n100 minutes a week to it in curriculum time, which is less than many other European\ncountries. Three European countries are giving children a head start in PE, France, Austria\nand Switzerland – offer at least two hours in primary and secondary schools. These\nfindings, from the European Union of Physical Education Associations, prompted\nspecialists in children’s physiology to call on European governments to give youngsters a\ndaily PE programme. The survey shows that the UK ranks 13th out of the 25 countries, with\nIreland bottom, averaging under an hour a week for PE. From age six to 18British children\nreceived, on average, 106 minutes of PE a week. Professor Armstrong, who presented the\nfindings at the meeting, noted that since the introduction of the national curriculum there\nhad been a marked fall in the time devoted to PE in UK schools, with only a minority of\npupils getting two hours a week.\nD As a former junior football international, Professor Armstrong is a passionate advocate\nfor sport. Although the Government has poured millions into beefing up sport in the\ncommunity, there is less commitment to it as part of the crammed school curriculum. This\nmeans that many children never acquire the necessary skills to thrive in team games. If\nthey are no good at them, they lose interest and establish an inactive pattern of behaviour.\nWhen this is coupled with a poor diet, it will lead inevitably to weight gain. Seventy per cent\nof British children give up all sport when they leave school, compared with only 20 per cent\nof French teenagers. Professor Armstrong believes that there is far too great an emphasis\non team games at school. “We need to look at the time devoted to PE and balance it\nbetween individual and pair activities, such as aerobics and badminton, as well as team\nsports. “He added that children need to have the opportunity to take part in a wide variety\nof individual, partner and team sports.\nE The good news, however, is that a few small companies and children’s activity groups\nhave reacted positively and creatively to the problem. Take That, shouts Gloria Thomas,\n \n1\n\nstriking a disco pose astride her mini-spacehopper. Take That, echo a flock of toddlers,\nadopting outrageous postures astride their space hoppers. ‘Michael Jackson, she shouts,\nand they all do a spoof fan-crazed shriek. During the wild and chaotic hopper race across\nthe studio floor, commands like this are issued and responded to with untrammelled glee.\nThe sight of 15 bouncing seven-year-olds who seem about to launch into orbit at every\nbounce brings tears to the eyes. Uncoordinated, loud, excited and emotional, children\nprovide raw comedy.\nF Any cardiovascular exercise is a good option, and it doesn’t necessarily have to be high\nintensity. It can be anything that gets your heart rate up: such as walking the dog,\nswimming, miming, skipping, hiking. “Even walking through the grocery store can be\nexercise,” Samis-Smith said. What they don’t know is that they’re at a Fit Kids class, and\nthat the fun is a disguise for the serious exercise plan they’re covertly being taken through.\nFit Kids trains parents to run fitness classes for children. ‘Ninety per cent of children don’t\nlike team sports,’ says company director, Gillian Gale.\nG A Prevention survey found that children whose parents keep in shape are much more\nlikely to have healthy body weights themselves. “There’s nothing worse than telling a child\nwhat he needs to do and not doing it yourself,” says Elizabeth Ward, R.D., a Boston\nnutritional consultant and author of Healthy Foods, Healthy Kids . “Set a good example and\nget your nutritional house in order first.” In the 1930s and ’40s, kids expended 800 calories\na day just walking, carrying water, and doing other chores, notes Fima Lifshitz, M.D., a\npediatric endocrinologist in Santa Barbara. “Now, kids in obese families are expending only\n200 calories a day in physical activity,” says Lifshitz, “incorporate more movement in your\nfamily’s lifepark farther away from the stores at the mall, take stairs instead of the elevator,\nand walk to nearby friends’ houses instead of driving.”\n \n2",
