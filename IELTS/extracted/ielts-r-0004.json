  "passage_text": "Reading Practice\n \n \nAcquiring the principles of mathematics and science\n \nA It has been pointed out that learning mathematics and science is not so much\nlearning facts as learning ways of thinking. It has also been emphasised that in order\nto learn science, people often have to change the way they think in ordinary\nsituations. For example, in order to understand even simple concepts such as heat\nand temperature, ways of thinking of temperature as a measure of heat must be\nabandoned and a distinction between ‘temperature’ and ‘heat’ must be learned.\nThese changes in ways of thinking are often referred to as conceptual changes. But\nhow do conceptual changes happen? How do young people change their ways of\nthinking as they develop and as they learn in school?\n \nB Traditional instruction based on telling students how modern scientists think does\nnot seem to be very successful. Students may learn the definitions, the formulae, the\nterminology, and yet still maintain their previous conceptions. This difficulty has\nbeen illustrated many times, for example, when instructed students are interviewed\nabout heat and temperature. It is often identified by teachers as a difficulty in\napplying the concepts learned in the classroom; students may be able to repeat a\nformula but fail to use the concept represented by the formula when they explain\nobserved events.\n \nC The psychologist Piaget suggested an interesting hypothesis relating to the\nprocess of cognitive change in children. Cognitive change was expected to result\nfrom the pupils’ own intellectual activity. When confronted with a result that\nchallenges their thinking - that is, when faced with conflict - pupils realise that they\nneed to think again about their own ways of solving problems, regardless of whether\nthe problem is one in mathematics or in science. He hypothesised that conflict\nbrings about disequilibrium, and then triggers equilibration processes that\nultimately produce cognitive change. For this reason, according to Piaget and his\ncolleagues, in order for pupils to progress in their thinking they need to be actively\nengaged in solving problems that will challenge their current mode of reasoning.\nHowever, Piaget also pointed out that young children do not always discard their\nideas in the face of contradictory evidence. They may actually discard the evidence\nand keep their theory.\n \nD Piaget’s hypothesis about how cognitive change occurs was later translated into\nan educational approach which is now termed ‘discovery learning’. Discovery\nlearning initially took what is now considered the Tone learner’ route. The role of the\nteacher was to select situations that challenged the pupils’ reasoning; and the\npupils’ peers had no real role in this process. However, it was subsequently\nproposed that interpersonal conflict, especially with peers, might play an important\nrole in promoting cognitive change. This hypothesis, originally advanced by Perret-\nClermont (1980) and Doise and Mugny (1984), has been investigated in many recent\nstudies of science teaching and learning.\nE Christine Howe and her colleagues, for example, have compared children’s\nprogress in understanding several types of science concepts when they are given\nthe opportunity to observe relevant events. In one study, Howe compared the\nprogress of 8 to 12-year-old children in understanding what influences motion down\n \n1\n\n \n \n \n \na slope. In order to ascertain the role of conflict in group work, they created two\nkinds of groups according to a pre-test: one in which the children had dissimilar\nviews, and a second in which the children had similar views.\n \nThey found support for the idea that children in the groups with dissimilar views progressed\nmore after their training sessions than those who had been placed in groups with similar\nviews. However, they found no evidence to support the idea that the children worked out\ntheir new conceptions during their group discussions, because progress was not actually\nobserved in a post-test immediately after the sessions of group work, but rather in a second\ntest given around four weeks after the group work.\nF In another study, Howe set out to investigate whether the progress obtained\nthrough pair work could be a function of the exchange of ideas. They investigated\nthe progress made by 12-15-year-old pupils in understanding the path of falling\nobjects, a topic that usually involves conceptual difficulties. In order to create pairs\nof pupils with varying levels of dissimilarity in their initial conceptions, the pupils’\npredictions and explanations of the path of falling objects were assessed before\nthey were engaged in pair work. The work sessions involved solving computer-\npresented problems, again about predicting and explaining the paths of falling\nobjects. A post-test, given to individuals, assessed the progress made by pupils in\ntheir conceptions of what influenced the path of falling objects.\n \n2",
