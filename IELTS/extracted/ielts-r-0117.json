Applying\nthe most conservative estimates to current demographic trends, the human population will\nincrease by about three billion people by then. An estimated 109 hectares of new land\n(about 20% larger than Brazil) will be needed to grow enough food to feed them, if\ntraditional farming methods continue as they are practised today.\nAt present, throughout the world, over 80% of the land that is suitable for raising crops is in\nuse. Historically, some 15% of that has been laid waste by poor management practices.\nWhat can be done to ensure enough food for the world’s population to live on ?\nThe concept of indoor farming is not new, since hothouse production of tomatoes and other\nproduce has been in vogue for some time. What is new is the urgent need to scale up this\ntechnology to accommodate another three billion people. Many believe an entirely new\napproach to indoor farming is required, employing cutting-edge technologies. One such\nproposal is for the ‘Vertical Farm’. The concept is of multi-storey buildings in which food\ncrops are grown in environmentally controlled conditions. Situated in the heart of urban\ncentres, they would drastically reduce the amount of transportation required to bring food to\nconsumers. Vertical farms would need to be efficient, cheap to construct and safe to\noperate. If successfully implemented, proponents claim, vertical farms offer the promise of\nurban renewal, sustainable production of a safe and varied food supply (through year-\nround production of all crops), and the eventual repair of ecosystems that have been\nsacrificed for horizontal farming.\nIt took humans 10,000 years to learn how to grow most of the crops we now take for\ngranted. Along the way, we despoiled most of the land we worked, often turning verdant,\nnatural ecozones into semi-arid deserts. Within that same time frame, we evolved into an\nurban species, in which 60% of the human population now lives vertically in cities. This\nmeans that, for the majority, we humans have shelter from the elements, yet we subject our\nfood-bearing plants to the rigours of the great outdoors and can do no more than hope for a\ngood weather year. However, more often than not now, due to a rapidly changing climate,\nthat is not what happens. Massive floods, long droughts, hurricanes and severe monsoons\ntake their toll each year, destroying millions of tons of valuable crops.\nThe supporters of vertical farming claim many potential advantages for the system. For\ninstance, crops would be produced all year round, as they would be kept in artificially\ncontrolled, optimum growing conditions. There would be no weather-related crop failures\ndue to droughts, floods or pests. All the food could be grown organically, eliminating the\nneed for herbicides, pesticides and fertilisers. The system would greatly reduce the\nincidence of many infectious diseases that are acquired at the agricultural interface.\nAlthough the system would consume energy, it would return energy to the grid via methane\ngeneration from composting nonedible parts of plants. It would also dramatically reduce\nfossil fuel use, by cutting out the need for tractors, ploughs and shipping.\nA major drawback of vertical farming, however, is that the plants would require artificial\nlight. Without it, those plants nearest the windows would be exposed to more sunlight and\ngrow more quickly, reducing the efficiency of the system. Single-storey greenhouses have\nthe benefit of natural overhead light; even so, many still need artificial lighting.\n \n1\n\nA multi-storey facility with no natural overhead light would require far more. Generating\nenough light could be prohibitively expensive, unless cheap, renewable energy is available,\nand this appears to be rather a future aspiration than a likelihood for the near future.\nOne variation on vertical farming that has been developed is to grow plants in stacked trays\nthat move on rails. Moving the trays allows the plants to get enough sunlight. This system\nis already in operation, and works well within a single-storey greenhouse with light reaching\nit from above: it Is not certain, however, that it can be made to work without that overhead\nnatural light.\nVertical farming is an attempt to address the undoubted problems that we face in producing\nenough food for a growing population. At the moment, though, more needs to be done to\nreduce the detrimental impact it would have on the environment, particularly as regards the\nuse of energy. While it is possible that much of our food will be grown in skyscrapers in\nfuture, most experts currently believe it is far more likely that we will simply use the space\navailable on urban rooftops.\n \n2",
