  "passage_text": "Reading Practice\n \nKatherine Mansfield\n \n \nKatherine Mansfield was a modernist writer of short fiction who was born and brought up in\nNew Zealand\n \n \nKatherine Mansfield Beauchamp Murry was born in 1888, into a prominent family in\nWellington, New Zealand. She became one of New Zealand's best-known writers, using\nthe pen name of Katherine Mansfield. The daughter of a banker, and born into a middle-\nclass family, she was also a first cousin of Countess Elizabeth von Arnim, a distinguished\nnovelist in her time. Mansfield had two older sisters and a younger brother. Her father,\nHarold Beauchamp, went on to become the chairman of the Bank of New Zealand. In 1893,\nthe Mansfield family moved to Karori, a suburb of Wellington, where Mansfield would spend\nthe happiest years of her childhood; she later used her memories of this time as an\ninspiration for her Prelude story.\nHer first published stories appeared in the High School Reporter and the Wellington Girls7\nHigh School magazine in 1898 and 1899. In 1902, she developed strong feelings for a\nmusician who played the cello, Arnold Trowell, although her feelings were not, for the most\npast, returned. Mansfield herself was an accomplished cellist, having received lesion from\nTrowell's father. Mansfied wrote in her journals of feeling isolated to some extent in New\nZealand, and, in general terms of her interest in the Maori people ( New Zealand's native\npeople), who were often portrayed in a sympathetic light in her later stories, such as How\nPearl Button was Kidnapped\n \nShe moved to London in 1903, where she attended Queen's college, along with her two\nsisters. Manfield recommenced playing the cello, an occupation that she believed, during\nher time at Queen's, she would take up professionally. She also began contributing to the\ncollege newspaper, with such a dedication to it that she eventually became its editor. She\nwas particularly interested in the works of the French writers of this period and on the 19th-\ncentury British writer, Oscar Wilde, and she was appreciated amongst fellow students at\nQueen's for her lively and charismatic approach to life and work. She met follow writer Ida\nBaker, a South African, at the college, and the pair became lifelong friends. Mansfield did\nnot actively support the suffragette movement in the Uk. Women in New Zeland had gained\nthe right to vote in 1893.\nMansfield first began journeying into the other parts of Europe in the period 1903-1906,\nmainly to Belgium and Germany. After finishing her schooling in England, she returned to\nher New Zealand home in 1906, only then beginning to write short stories in a serious way.\nShe had several works published in Australia in a magazine called Native Comparison,\nwhich was her first paid writing work, and by this time she had her mind set on becoming a\nprofessional writer. It was also the first occasion on which she used the pseudonym\n\"k.Mansfied\".\n \n \nMansfield rapidly grew discontented with the provincial New Zealand lifestyle, and with her\nfamily. Two years later she headed again in London. Her father sent her an annual subsidy\nof €100 for the rest of her life. In later years, she would express both admiration and\ndisdain for New Zealand in her journals.\nIn 1911, Mansfield met John Middleton Murry, the Oxford scholar and editor of the literary\nmagazine Rhythm. They were later to marry in 1918. Mansfield became a co-editor of\n \n1\n\n \n \n \n \n \nRhythm, which was subsequently called The Blue Review, in which more of her works were\npublished. She and Murry lived in various houses in England and briefly in Paris. The Blue\nReview failed to gain enough readers and was no longer published. Their attempt to set up\nas writers in Paris was cut short by Murry's bankruptcy, which resulted from the failure of\nthis and other journals. Life back in England meant frequently changed addresses and very\nlimited funds.\nBetween 1915 and 1918, Mansfield moved between England and Bandoi, France. She and\nMurry developed close contact with other well-known writers of the time such as DH\nLawrence, Bertrand Russell and Aldous Huxley. By October 1918 Mansfield had become\nseriously ill; she had been diagnosed with tuberculosis and was advised to enter a\nsanatorium. She could no longer spend time with writers in London. In the autumn of 1918\nshe was so ill that she decided to go to Ospedale in Italy. It was the publication of Bliss and\nOther Stories in 1920 that was to solidify Mansfield's reputation as a writer.\n \n \nMansfied also spent time in Menton, France, as the tenant of her father's cousin at \" The\nVilla Isola Bella\". There she wrote she pronounced to be \"...the only story that satisfies me\nto any extent\".\nMansfield produced a great deal of work in the final years of her life, and much of her prose\nand poetry remained unpublished at her death in 1923. After her death, her husband,\nMurry, took on the task of editing and publishing her works. His efforts resulted in two\nadditional volumes of short stories.
