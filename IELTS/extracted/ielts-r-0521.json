  "passage_text": "Reading Practice\n \nThe Nagymaros Dam\nWhen Janos Vargha, a biologist from the Hungarian Academy of Sciences, began a new\ncareer as a writer with a small monthly nature magazine called Buvar, it was 9 years after\nthe story behind the fall of the Berlin Wall had started to unfold. During his early research,\nhe went to a beauty spot on the river Danube outside Budapest known as the Danube\nBend to interview local officials about plans to build a small park on the site of an ancient\nHungarian capital.\nOne official mentioned that passing this tree-lined curve in the river, a popular tourism spot\nfor Hungarians was monotonous. Also, it was to be submerged by a giant hydroelectric\ndam in secret by a much-feared state agency known simply as the Water Management.\nVargha investigated and learned that the Nagymaros dam (pronounced “nosh-marosh”)\nwould cause pollution, destroy underground water reserves, dry out wetlands and wreck\nthe unique ecosystem of central Europe’s longest river. Unfortunately, nobody objected. “Of\ncourse, I wrote an article. But there was a director of the Water Management on the\nmagazine’s editorial board. The last time, he went to the printers and stopped the presses,\nthe article was never published. I was frustrated and angry, but I was ultimately interested\nin why they cared to ban my article,” he remembers today. \nHe found that the Nagymaros dam was part of a joint project with neighbouring\nCzechoslovakia to produce hydroelectricity, irrigate farms and enhance navigation. They\nwould build two dams and re-engineer the Danube for 200 kilometres where it created the\nborder between them. “The Russians were working together, too. They wanted to take their\nbig ships from the Black Sea right up the Danube to the border with Austria.”\nVargha was soon under vigorous investigation, and some of his articles got past the\ncensors. He gathered supporters for some years, but he was one of only a few people who\nbelieved the dam should be stopped. He was hardly surprised when the Water\nManagement refused to debate the project in public. After a public meeting, the\nbureaucrats had pulled out at the last minute. Vargha knew he had to take the next step.\n“We decided it wasn’t enough to talk and write, so we set up an organization, the Danube\nCircle. We announced that we didn’t agree with censorship. We would act as if we were\nliving in a democracy.” he says.\nThe Danube Circle was illegal and the secret publications it produced turned out to be\nsamizdat leaflets. In an extraordinary act of defiance, it gathered 10,000 signatures for a\npetition objecting to the dam and made links with environmentalists in the west, inviting\nthem to Budapest for a press conference. \nThe Hungarian government enforced a news blackout on the dam, but articles about the\nDanube Circle began to be published and appear in the western media. In 1985, the Circle\nand Vargha, a public spokesman, won the Right Livelihood award known as the alternative\nNobel prize. Officials told Vargha he should not take the prize but he ignored them. The\nfollowing year when Austrian environmentalists joined a protest in Budapest, they were met\nwith tear gas and batons. Then the Politburo had Vargha taken from his new job as editor\nof the Hungarian version of Scientific American.\nThe dam became a focus for opposition to the hated regime. Communists tried to hold\n \n1\n\nback the waters in the Danube and resist the will of the people. Vargha says, “Opposing\nthe state directly was still hard.” “Objecting to the dam was less of a hazard, but it was still\nconsidered a resistance to the state.”\nUnder increasing pressure from the anti-dam movement, the Hungarian Communist Party\nwas divided. Vargha says, “Reformists found that the dam was not very popular and\neconomical. It would be cheaper to generate electricity by burning coal or nuclear power.”\n“But hardliners were standing for Stalinist ideas of large dams which mean symbols of\nprogress.” Environmental issues seemed to be a weak point of east European communism\nin its final years. During the 1970s under the support of the Young Communist Leagues, a\nhost of environmental groups had been founded. Party officials saw them as a harmless\nproduct of youthful idealism created by Boy Scouts and natural history societies.\nGreen idealism steadily became a focal point for political opposition. In Czechoslovakia, the\nhuman rights of Charter 77 took up environmentalism. The green-minded people of both\nPoland and Estonia participated in the Friends of the Earth International to protest against\nair pollution. Bulgarian environmentalists built a resistance group, called Ecoglasnost,\nwhich held huge rallies in 1989. Big water engineering projects were potent symbols of the\nold Stalinism.\n \n2",
