  "passage_text": "Reading Practice\n \nOrigin of Species & Continent Formation\nA\nTHE FACT THAT there was once a Pangean supercontinent, a Panthalassa Ocean, and a\nTethys Ocean, has profound implications for the evolution of multicellular life on Earth.\nThese considerations were unknown to the scientists of the 19th century – making their\nscientific deductions even more remarkable. Quite independently of each other, Charles\nDarwin and his young contemporary Alfred Russel Wallace reached the conclusion that life\nhad evolved by natural selection. Wallace later wrote in My Life of his own inspiration:\nB\nWhy do some species die and some life? The answer was clearly that on the whole the\nbest fitted lived. From the effects of disease the most healthy escaped; from enemies the\nstrongest, the swiftest or the most cunning from famine the best hunters – then it suddenly\nflashed on me that this self-acting process would improve the race, because in every\ngeneration the inferior would inevitably be killed off and the superior would remain, that is,\nthe fittest would survive.\nC\nBoth Darwin’s and Wallace’s ideas about natural selection had been influenced by the\nessays of Thomas Malthus in his Principles of Population. Their conclusion, however, had\nbeen the direct result of their personal observation of animals and plants in widely\nseparated geographic locations: Darwin from his experiences during the voyage of\nthe Beagle, and particularly during the ship’s visit to the Galapagos Islands in the East\nPacific in 1835; Wallace during his years of travel in the Amazon Basin and in the\nIndonesia-Australian Archipelago in the 1850s.\nD\nDarwin had been documenting his ideas on natural selection for many years when he\nreceived a paper on this selfsame subject from Wallace, who asked for Darwin’s opinion\nand help in getting it published. In July 1858, Charles Lyell and J. D Hooker, close friends\nof Darwin, pressed Darwin to present his conclusions so that he would not lose priority to\nan unknown naturalist. Presiding over the hastily called but now historic meeting of the\nLinnean Society in London, Lyell and Hooker explained to the distinguished members how\n“these two gentlemen” (who were absent: Wallace was abroad and Darwin chose not to\nattend), had “independently and unknown to one another, conceived the same very\ningenious theory,”\nE\nBoth Darwin and Wallace had realized that the anomalous distribution of species in\nparticular regions had profound evolutionary significance. Subsequently, Darwin spent the\nrest of his days in almost total seclusion thinking and writing mainly about the origin of\nspecies. In contrast, Wallace applied himself to the science of biogeography, the study of\nthe pattern and distribution of species, and its significance, resulting in the publication of a\nmassive two-volume work the Geographical Distribution of Animals in 1876.\n \n1\n\nF\nWallace was a gentle and modest man, but also persistent and quietly courageous. He\nspent years working in the most arduous possible climates and terrains, particularly in the\nMalay archipelago, he made patient and detailed zoological observations and collected a\nhuge number of specimens for museums and collectors-which is how he made a living.\nOne result of his work was the conclusion that there is a distinct faunal boundary, called\n“Wallace’s line,” between an Asian realm of animals in Java, Bronco and the Philipiones\nand an Australian realm in New Guinea and Australia. In essence, this boundary posed a\ndifficult question: How on Earth did plants and animals with a clear affinity to the Northern\nHemisphere meet with their Southern Hemispheric counterparts along such a distinct\nMalaysian demarcation zone? Wallace was uncertain about demarcation on one particular\nisland-Celebes, a curiously shaped place that is midway between the two groups. Initially,\nhe assigned its flora-fauna to the Australian side of the line, but later he transferred it to the\nAsian side. Today we know the reason for his dilemma. 200MYA East and West Celebes\nwere islands with their own natural history lying on opposite sides of the Tethys Ocean.\nThey did not collide until about 15 MYA. The answer to the main question is that Wallace’s\nLine categorizes Laurasia-derived flora-fauna (the Asian) and Gondwana-derived flora-\nfauna (the Australian), fauna that had evolved on opposing shares of the Tethys. The\nclosure of the Tethys Ocean today is manifested by the ongoing collision of Australia/New\nGuinea with Indochina/Indonesia and the continuing closure of the Mediterranean Sea – a\nremnant of the Western Tethys Ocean.\nG\nIN HIS ORIGIN OF CONTINENTS AND OCEANS, Wegener quoted at length from\nWallace’s Geographical Distribution of Animals. According to Wegener’s reading, Wallace\nhad identified three clear divisions of Australian animals, which supported his own theory of\ncontinental displacement. Wallace had shown that animals long established in\nsouthwestern Australia had an affinity with animals in South Africa, Madagascar, India, and\nCeylon, but did not have an affinity with those in Asia. Wallace also showed that Australian\nmarsupials and monotremes are clearly related to those in South America, the Moluccas,\nand various Pacific islands and that none are found in neighboring Indonesia. From this\nand related data, Wegener concluded that the then broadly accepted “landbridge” theory\ncould not account for this distribution of animals and that only this theory of continental drift\ncould explain it.\nH\nThe theory that Wegener dismissed in preference to his own proposed that plants and\nanimals had once migrated across now-submerged intercontinental landbridges. In 1885,\none of Europe’s leading geologists, Eduard Suess, theorized that as the rigid Earth cools,\nits upper-crust shrinks and wrinkles like the withering skin of an aging apple. He suggested\nthat the planet’s seas and oceans now fill the wrinkles between once-contiguous plateaus.\nI\nToday, we know that we live on a dynamic Earth with shifting, colliding and separating\ntectonic plates, not a “withering skin”, and the main debate in the field of biogeography has\nshifted. The discussion now concerns “dispersalism” versus “vicarianism”: unrestricted\nradiation of species on the one hand and the development of barriers to migration on the\nother. Dispersion is a short-term phenomenon – the daily or seasonal migration of species\n \n2\n\nand their radiation to the limits of their natural environment on an extensive and continuous\nlandmass. Vicarian evolution, however, depends upon the separation and isolation of a\nvariety of species within the confines of natural barriers in the form of islands, lakes, or\nshallow seas – topographical features that take a long time to develop.\n \n3",
