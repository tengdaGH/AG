  "passage_text": "Reading Practice\n \nIT’S ECO-LOGICAL\nPlanning an eco-friendly holiday can be a minefield for the well- meaning traveller,\nsays Steve Watkins. But help is now at hand.\nIf there were awards for tourism phrases that have been hijacked, diluted and misused then\n‘ecotourism’ would earn top prize. The term first surfaced in the early 1980s reflecting a\nsurge in environmental awareness and a realisation by tour operators that many travellers\nwanted to believe their presence abroad would not have a negative impact. It rapidly\nbecame the hottest marketing tag a holiday could carry.\nThese days the ecotourism label is used to cover anything from a two-week tour living with\nremote Indonesian tribes, to a one-hour motorboat trip through an Australian gorge. In fact,\nany tour that involves cultural interaction, natural beauty spots, wildlife or a dash of soft\nadventure is likely to be included in the overflowing ecotourism folder. There is no doubt\nthe original motives behind the movement were honourable attempts to provide a way for\nthose who cared to make informed choices, but the lack of regulations and a standard\nindustry definition left many travellers lost in an ecotourism jungle.\nIt is easier to understand why the ecotourism market has become so overcrowded when\nwe look at its wider role in the world economy. According to World Tourism Organisation\nfigures, ecotourism is worth US$20 billion a year and makes up one-fifth of all international\ntourism. Add to this an annual growth rate of around five per cent and the pressure for\nmany operators, both in developed and developing countries, to jump on the accelerating\nbandwagon is compelling. Without any widely recognised accreditation system, the\nconsumer has been left to investigate the credentials of an operator themselves. This is a\ntime-consuming process and many travellers usually take an operator’s claims at face\nvalue, only adding to the proliferation of fake ecotours.\nHowever, there are several simple questions that will provide qualifying evidence of a\ncompany’s commitment to minimise its impact on the environment and maximise the\nbenefits to the tourism area’s local community. For example, does the company use\nrecycled or sustainable, locally harvested materials to build its tourist properties? Do they\npay fair wages to all employees? Do they offer training to employees? It is common for city\nentrepreneurs to own tour companies in country areas, which can mean the money you\npay ends up in the city rather than in the community being visited. By taking a little extra\ntime to investigate the ecotourism options, it is not only possible to guide your custom to\nworthy operators but you will often find that the experience they offer is far more rewarding.\nThe ecotourism business is still very much in need of a shake-up and a standardised\napproach. There are a few organisations that have sprung up in the last ten years or so\nthat endeavour to educate travellers and operators about the benefits of responsible\necotourism. Founded in 1990, the Ecotourism Society (TES) is a non-profit organisation of\ntravel industry, conservation and ecological professionals, which aims to make ecotourism\na genuine tool for conservation and sustainable development. Helping to create inherent\neconomic value in wilderness environments and threatened cultures has undoubtedly been\none of the ecotourism movement’s most notable achievements. TES organises an annual\ninitiative to further aid development of the ecotourism industry. This year it is launching\n‘Your Travel Choice Makes a Difference’, an educational campaign aimed at helping\nconsumers understand the potential positive and negative impacts of their travel decisions.\n \n1\n\nTES also offers guidance on the choice of ecotour and has established a register of\napproved ecotourism operators around the world.\nA leading ecotourism operator in the United Kingdom is Tribes, which won the 1999\nTourism Concern and Independent Traveller’s World ‘Award for Most Responsible Tour\nOperator’. Amanda Marks, owner and director of Tribes, believes that the ecotourism\nindustry still has some way to go to get its house in order. Until now, no ecotourism\naccreditation scheme has really worked, principally because there has been no systematic\nway of checking that accredited companies actually comply with the code of practice.\nAmanda believes that the most promising system is the recently re-launched Green Globe\n21 scheme. The Green Globe 21 award is based on the sustainable development\nstandards contained in Agenda 21 from the 1992 Earth Summit and was originally\ncoordinated by the World Travel & Tourism Council (WTTC). The scheme is now an\nindependent concern, though the WTTC still supports it. Until recently, tour companies\nbecame affiliates and could use the Green Globe logo merely on payment of an annual fee,\nhardly a suitable qualifying standard. However, in November 1999 Green Globe 21\nintroduced an annual, independent check on operators wishing to use the logo.\nMiriam Cain, from the Green Globe 21 marketing development, explains that current and\nnew affiliates will now have one year to ensure that their operations comply with Agenda 21\nstandards. If they fail the first inspection, they can only reapply once. The inspection\nprocess is not a cheap option, especially for large companies, but the benefits of having\nGreen Globe status and the potential operational cost savings that complying with the\nstandards can bring should be significant. ‘We have joint ventures with organisations\naround the world, including Australia and the Caribbean, that will allow us to effectively\ncheck all affiliate operators,’ says Miriam. The scheme also allows destination communities\nto become Green Globe 21 approved.\nFor a relatively new industry it is not surprising that ecotourism has undergone teething\npains. However, there are signs that things are changing for the better. With a committed\nand unified approach by the travel industry, local communities, travellers and\nenvironmental experts could make ecotourism a tag to be proud of and trusted.\n \n2",
