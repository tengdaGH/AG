  "passage_text": "Reading Practice\n \nGlaciers\nA\nBesides the earth’s oceans, glacier ice is the largest source of water on earth. A glacier is a\nmassive stream or sheet of ice that moves underneath itself under the influence of gravity.\nSome glaciers travel down mountains or valleys, while others spread across a large\nexpanse of land. Heavily glaciated regions such as Greenland and Antarctica are called\ncontinental glaciers. These two ice sheets encompass more than 95 percent of the earth’s\nglacial ice. The Greenland ice sheet is almost 10,000 feet thick in some areas, and the\nweight of this glacier is so heavy that much of the region has been depressed below sea\nlevel. Smaller glaciers that occur at higher elevations are called alpine or valley glaciers.\nAnother way of classifying glaciers is in terms of their internal temperature. In temperate\nglaciers, the ice within the glacier is near its melting point. Polar glaciers, in contrast,\nalways maintain temperatures far below melting.\nB\nThe majority of the earth’s glaciers are located near the poles, though glaciers exist on all\ncontinents, including Africa and Oceania. The reason glaciers are generally formed in high\nalpine regions is that they require cold temperatures throughout the year. In these areas\nwhere there is little opportunity for summer ablation (loss of mass), snow changes to\ncompacted fim and then crystallized ice. During periods in which melting and evaporation\nexceed the amount of snowfall, glaciers will retreat rather than progress. While glaciers rely\nheavily on snowfall, other climactic conditions including freezing rain, avalanches, and\nwind, contribute to their growth. One year of below average precipitation can stunt the\ngrowth of a glacier tremendously. With the rare exception of surging glaciers, a common\nglacier flows about 10 inches per day in the summer and 5 inches per day in the winter.\nThe fastest glacial surge on record occurred in 1953, when the Kutiah Glacier in Pakistan\ngrew more than 12 kilometers in three months.\nC\nThe weight and pressure of ice accumulation causes glacier movement. Glaciers move out\nfrom under themselves, via plastic deformation and basal slippage. First, the internal flow\nof ice crystals begins to spread outward and downward from the thickened snow pack also\nknown as the zone of accumulation. Next, the ice along the ground surface begins to slip in\nthe same direction. Seasonal thawing at the base of the glacier helps to facilitate this\nslippage. The middle of a glacier moves faster than the sides and bottom because there is\nno rock to cause friction. The upper part of a glacier rides on the ice below. As a glacier\nmoves it carves out a U-shaped valley similar to a riverbed, but with much steeper walls\nand a flatter bottom.\nD\nBesides the extraordinary rivers of ice, glacial erosion creates other unique physical\nfeatures in the landscape such as horns, fjords, hanging valleys, and cirques. Most of these\nlandforms do not become visible until after a glacier has receded. Many are created by\nmoraines, which occur at the sides and front of a glacier. Moraines are formed when\nmaterial is picked up along the way and deposited in a new location. When many alpine\n \n1\n\nglaciers occur on the same mountain, these moraines can create a horn. The Matterhorn,\nin the Swiss Alps is one of the most famous horns. Fjords, which are very common in\nNorway, are coastal valleys that fill with ocean water during a glacial retreat. Hanging\nvalleys occur when two or more glacial valleys intersect at varying elevations. It is common\nfor waterfalls to connect the higher and lower hanging valleys, such as in Vosemite\nNational Park.

In\nthe past century, most glaciers have been retreating rather than flowing forward. It is\nunknown whether this glacial activity is due to human impact or natural causes, but by\nstudying glacier movement, and comparing climate and agricultural profiles over hundreds\nof years, glaciologists can begin to understand environmental issues such as global\nwarming.\n \n2",
