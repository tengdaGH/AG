Opened in 2002,\nit is central to the ambitious £84.5m Millennium Link project to restore navigability across\nScotland by reconnecting the historic waterways of the Forth & Clyde and Union Canals.\nThe major challenge of the project lays in the fact that the Forth & Clyde Canal is situated\n35 metres below the level of the Union Canal. Historically, the two canals had been joined\nnear the town of Falkirk by a sequence of 11 locks - enclosed sections of canal in which the\nwater level could be raised or lowered - that stepped down across a distance of 1.5 km.\nThis had been dismantled in 1933, thereby breaking the link. When the project was\nlaunched in 1994, the British Waterways authority were keen to create a dramatic twenty-\nfirst-century landmark which would not only be a fitting commemoration of the Millennium,\nbut also a lasting symbol of the economic regeneration of the region.\nNumerous ideas were submitted for the project, including concepts ranging from rolling\neggs to tilting tanks, from giant seesaws to overhead monorails. The eventual winner was a\nplan for the huge rotating steel boat lift which was to become The Falkirk Wheel. The\nunique shape of the structure is claimed to have been inspired by various sources, both\nmanmade and natural, most notably a Celtic double headed axe, but also the vast turning\npropeller of a ship, the ribcage of a whale or the spine of a fish.\nThe various parts of The Falkirk Wheel were all constructed and assembled, like one giant\ntoy building set, at Butterley Engineering's Steelworks in Derbyshire, some 400 km from\nFalkirk. A team there carefully assembled the 1,200 tonnes of steel, painstakingly fitting the\npieces together to an accuracy of just 10 mm to ensure a perfect final fit. In the summer of\n2001, the structure was then dismantled and transported on 35 lorries to Falkirk, before all\nbeing bolted back together again on the ground, and finally lifted into position in five large\nsections by crane. The Wheel would need to withstand immense and constantly changing\nstresses as it rotated, so to make the structure more robust, the steel sections were bolted\nrather than welded together. Over 45,000 bolt holes were matched with their bolts, and\neach bolt was hand-tightened.\nThe Wheel consists of two sets of opposing axe-shaped arms, attached about 25 metres\napart to a fixed central spine.\nTwo diametrically opposed water-filled 'gondolas', each with a capacity of 360,000 litres,\nare fitted between the ends of the arms. These gondolas always weigh the same, whether\nor not they are carrying boats. This is because, according to Archimedes' principle of\ndisplacement, floating objects displace their own weight in water. So when a boat enters a\ngondola, the amount of water leaving the gondola weighs exactly the same as the boat.\nThis keeps the Wheel balanced and so, despite its enormous mass, it rotates through 180°\nin five and a half minutes while using very little power. It takes just 1.5 kilowatt-hours (5.4\nMJ) of energy to rotate the Wheel -roughly the same as boiling eight small domestic kettles\nof water.\nBoats needing to be lifted up enter the canal basin at the level of the Forth & Clyde Canal\nand then enter the lower gondola of the Wheel. Two hydraulic steel gates are raised, so as\n \n1\n\nto seal the gondola off from the water in the canal basin. The water between the gates is\nthen pumped out.
