  "passage_text": "Reading Practice\n \nMusic and the emotions\nNeuroscientist Jonah Lehrer considers the emotional power of music\nWhy does music make us feel? On the one hand, music is a purely abstract art form,\ndevoid of language or explicit ideas. And yet, even though music says little, it still manages\nto touch us deeply. When listening to our favourite songs, our body betrays all the\nsymptoms of emotional arousal. The pupils in our eyes dilate, our pulse and blood pressure\nrise, the electrical conductance of our skin is lowered, and the cerebellum, a brain region\nassociated with bodily movement, becomes strangely active. Blood is even re-directed to\nthe muscles in our legs. In other words, sound stirs us at our biological roots.\nA recent paper in Neuroscience by a research team in Montreal, Canada, marks an\nimportant step in repealing the precise underpinnings of ‘the potent pleasurable stimulus’\nthat is music. Although the study involves plenty of fancy technology, including functional\nmagnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and ligand-based positron emission tomography (PET)\nscanning, the experiment itself was rather straightforward. After screening 217 individuals\nwho responded to advertisements requesting people who experience ‘chills’ to instrumental\nmusic, the scientists narrowed down the subject pool to ten. They then asked the subjects\nto bring in their playlist of favourite songs - virtually every genre was represented, from\ntechno to tango - and played them the music while their brain activity was monitored.\nBecause the scientists were combining methodologies (PET and fMRI), they were able to\nobtain an impressively exact and detailed portrait of music in the brain. The first thing they\ndiscovered is that music triggers the production of dopamine - a chemical with a key role in\nsetting people’s moods - by the neurons (nerve cells) in both the dorsal and ventral regions\nof the brain. As these two regions have long been linked with the experience of pleasure,\nthis finding isn’t particularly surprising.\nWhat is rather more significant is the finding that the dopamine neurons in the caudate - a\nregion of the brain involved in learning stimulus-response associations, and in anticipating\nfood and other ‘reward’ stimuli - were at their most active around 15 seconds before the\nparticipants’ favourite moments in the music. The researchers call this the ‘anticipatory\nphase’ and argue that the purpose of this activity is to help us predict the arrival of our\nfavourite part. The question, of course, is what all these dopamine neurons are up to. Why\nare they so active in the period preceding the acoustic climax? After all, we typically\nassociate surges of dopamine with pleasure, with the processing of actual rewards. And\nyet, this cluster of cells is most active when the ‘chills’ have yet to arrive, when the melodic\npattern is still unresolved.\nOne way to answer the question is to look at the music and not the neurons. While music\ncan often seem (at least to the outsider) like a labyrinth of intricate patterns, it turns out that\nthe most important part of every song or symphony is when the patterns break down, when\nthe sound becomes unpredictable. If the music is too obvious, it is annoyingly boring, like\nan alarm clock. Numerous studies, after all, have demonstrated that dopamine neurons\nquickly adapt to predictable rewards. If we know what’s going to happen next, then we\ndon’t get excited. This is why composers often introduce a key note in the beginning of a\nsong, spend most of the rest of the piece in the studious avoidance of the pattern, and then\nfinally repeat it only at the end. The longer we are denied the pattern we expect, the greater\nthe emotional release when the pattern returns, safe and sound.\n \n1\n\nTo demonstrate this psychological principle, the musicologist Leonard Meyer, in his classic\nbook Emotion and Meaning in Music (1956), analysed the 5th movement of Beethoven’s\nString Quartet in C-sharp minor, Op. 131. Meyer wanted to show how music is defined by\nits flirtation with - but not submission to - our expectations of order. Meyer dissected 50\nmeasures (bars) of the masterpiece, showing how Beethoven begins with the clear\nstatement of a rhythmic and harmonic pattern and then, in an ingenious tonal dance,\ncarefully holds off repeating it. What Beethoven does instead is suggest variations of the\npattern. Me wants to preserve an element of uncertainty in his music, making our brains\nbeg for the one chord he refuses to give us. Beethoven saves that chord for the end.\n \nAccording to Meyer, it is the suspenseful tension of music, arising out of our unfulfilled\nexpectations, that is the source of the music’s feeling. While earlier theories of music\nfocused on the way a sound can refer to the real world of images and experiences - its\n‘connotative’ meaning - Meyer argued that the emotions we find in music come from the\nunfolding events of the music itself. This ‘embodied meaning’ arises from the patterns the\nsymphony invokes and then ignores. It is this uncertainty that triggers the surge of\ndopamine in the caudate, as we struggle to figure out what will happen next. We can\npredict some of the notes, but we can’t predict them all, and that is what keeps us listening,\nwaiting expectantly for our reward, for the pattern to be completed.\n \n2",
