  "passage_text": "Reading Practice\n \nWhat makes a musical expert?\nHow does someone become expert in music? And IS it really possible to have a ‘talent’ for\nmusic?\nDoes that class of people acknowledged to be musical experts just have more of the same\nbasic skills we are all endowed with, or do they have a set of abilities - or neural structures\n- that are totally different from those of the rest of US? Are high levels of musical\nachievement simply the result of training and practice, or are they based on innate brain\nstructure - what we refer to as ‘talent’? Talent can be defined as something that originates\nin genetic structures and that is identifiable by trained people who can recognize its\nexistence before a person has achieved exceptional levels of performance. The emphasis\non early identification means that to investigate it, we study the development of skills in\nchildren.\nIt is evident that some children acquire skills more rapidly than others: the age of onset for\nwalking and talking varies widely, even between children in the same household. There\nmay be genetic factors at work, but these are closely linked with other factors - with a\npresumably environmental component - such as motivation and family dynamics. Similar\nfactors can influence musical development and can mask the contribution of genetics to\nmusical ability.\nBrain studies, so far, haven’t been of much use in sorting out the issues. Gottfried Schlaug\nat Harvard collected brain scans of individuals with absolute pitch (AP) and showed that a\nregion in the brain called the planum temporale is larger in these people than in others.\nThis suggests that the planum is involved in AP, but it’s not clear if it starts out larger in\npeople who eventually acquire AP, or if the acquisition of AP makes the planum increase in\nsize.\nResults of research into the areas of the brain involved in skilled motor movement are more\nconclusive. Studies of violin players have shown that the region of the brain responsible for\ncontrolling the movement of the left hand (the hand that requires greater precision in violin\nplaying) increases in size as a result of practice. We do not know yet if the propensity for\nincrease pre-exists in some-peopled not others.\nThe evidence against talent comes from research on how much training the experts do.\nLike experts in mathematics, chess, or sports, experts in music require lengthy periods of\ninstruction and practice. In several studies, the very best music students\n \n \nWere found to have practiced more than twice as much as the others. In another study,\nstudents were secretly divided into two groups based on teachers’ perceptions of their\ntalent. Several years later, it was found that the students who achieved the highest\nperformance ratings had practiced the most, irrespective of which ‘talent’ group they had\nbeen assigned to, suggesting that practice does not merely correlate with achievement, but\ncauses it.\nAnders Ericsson, at Florida state University, approaches the topic of musical expertise as a\ngeneral problem in cognitive psychology. He takes as a starting point the assumption that\nthere are certain issues involved in becoming an expert at anything; that we can learn\nabout musical expertise by studying expert chess players, athletes, artists, mathematicians,\n \n1\n\nas well as the musicians themselves. The emerging picture from such studies is that ten\nthousand hours of practice is required to achieve the level of mastery associated with being\na world-class expert - in anything. In study after study, of composers, ice skaters, concert\npianists, chess players and master criminals, this number comes up again and again.\nSomeone would do this amount of practice if they practiced, for example, roughly 20 hours\na week for ten years. Of course, this does not address why some people do not seem to\nget anywhere when they practice, and why some people get more out of their practice\nsessions than others. But no-one has yet found a case in which true world-class expertise\nwas accomplished in less time. It seems that it takes the brain this long to assimilate all that\nit needs to know to achieve true mastery.\nThe ten-thousand-hour theory is consistent with what we know about how the brain learns.\nLearning requires the assimilation and consolidation of information in neural tissue. The\nmore experiences we have with something, the stronger the memory/learning trace for that\nexperience becomes. Although people differ in how long it takes them to consolidate\ninformation neutrally, it remains true that increased practice leads to a greater number of\nneural traces, which create stronger memory representation.\n \nThe classic rebuttal to this theory goes something like this: ‘What about Mozart? I hear that\nhe composed his first symphony at the age of four!’ First, there is a factual error here:\nMozart did not write it until he was eight, still, this is unusual, to say the least. However, this\nearly work received little acclaim and was not performed very often. In fact, the only reason\nwe know about it is because the child who wrote it grew up to become Mozart. And Mozart\nhad an expert teacher in his father, who was renowned as a teacher of musicians all over\nEurope. We do not know how much Mozart practiced, but if he started at age two and\nworked thirty- two hours a week (quite possible, given that his father was a stern\ntaskmaster) he would have made his ten thousand hours by the time he composed his first\nsymphony. This does not mean that there are no genetic factors involved in Mozart’s\ngreatness, but that inborn traits may not be the only cause.\n \n[1] individuals with absolute pitch: people who can identify or sing any musical note\ncorrectly without help\n \n2",
