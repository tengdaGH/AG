But it also\nhas other applications nearer home.\nFreeze-drying is like suspended animation for food: you can store a freeze-dried meal for\nyears, and then, when you’re finally ready to eat it. you can completely revitalise it with a\nlittle hot water. Even after several years, the original foodstuff will be virtually unchanged.\nThe technique basically involves completely removing the water from some material, such\nas food while leaving the rest of the material virtually intact. The main reason for doing this\nis either to preserve the food or to reduce its weight. Removing the water from food keeps it\nfrom spoiling, because the microorganisms such as bacteria that cause spoiling cannot\nsurvive without it. Similarly, the enzymes which occur naturally in food cannot cause\nripening without water, so removing water from food will also stop the ripening process.\nFreeze-drying significantly reduces the total weight of the food because most food is largely\nmade up of water; for example, many fruits are more than 80 00% water. Removing this\nmakes the food much lighter and therefore makes transportation less difficult. The military\nand camping-supply companies freeze-dry foods to make them easier for an individual to\ncarry and NASA has also freeze-dried foods for the cramped quarters on board spacecraft.\nThe process is also used to preserve other sorts of material, such as pharmaceuticals.\nChemists can greatly extend pharmaceutical shelf life by freeze-drying the material and\nstoring it in a container free of oxygen and water. Similarly, research scientists may use\nfreeze-drying to preserve biological samples for long periods of time. Even valuable\nmanuscripts that had been water damaged have been saved by using this process.\nFreeze-drying is different from simple drying because it is able to remove almost all the\nwater from materials, whereas simple drying techniques can only remove 90-95%. This\nmeans that the damage caused by bacteria and enzymes can virtually be stopped rather\nthan just slowed down. In addition, the composition and structure of the material is not\nsignificantly changed, so materials can be revitalised without compromising the quality of\nthe original.\nThis is possible because in freeze-drying, solid water - ice - is converted directly into water\nvapour, missing out the liquid phase entirely. This is called ‘sublimation’, the shift from a\nsolid directly into a gas. Just like evaporation, sublimation occurs when a molecule gains\nenough energy to break free from the molecules around it. Water will sublime from a solid\n(ice) to a gas (vapour) when the molecules have enough energy to break free but the\nconditions aren't right for a liquid to form. These conditions arc determined by heat and\natmospheric pressure. When the temperature is above freezing point, so that ice can thaw,\nbut the atmospheric pressure is too low for a liquid to form (below 0.06 atmospheres\n(ATM)) then it becomes a gas.\nThis is the principle on which a freeze-drying machine is based. The material to be\npreserved is placed in a freeze-drying chamber which is connected to a freezing coil and\nrefrigerator compressor. When the chamber is sealed the compressor lowers the\ntemperature inside it. I he material is frozen solid, which separates the water from\neverything around it on a molecular level, even though the water is still present. Next, a\n \n1\n\nvacuum pump forces air out of the chamber, lowering the atmospheric pressure below to\n0.06 ATM. The heating units apply a small amount of heat to the shelves in the chamber,\ncausing the ice to change phase. Since the pressure in the chamber is so low, the ice turns\ndirectly into water vapour, which leaves the freeze-drying chamber, and flows past the\nfreezing coil. The water vapour condenses onto the freezing coil in the form of solid ice, in\nthe same way that water condenses as frost on a cold day.\nThe process continues for many hours (even days) while the material gradually dries out.\nThis time is necessary to avoid overheating, which might affect the structure of the\nmaterial. Once it has dried sufficiently, it is sealed in a moisture-free package. As long as\nthe package is secure, the material can sit on a shelf for years and years without\ndegrading, until it is restored to its original form with a little hot water. If everything works\ncorrectly, the material will go through the entire process almost completely unscathed.\nIn fact, freeze-drying, as a general concept, is not new but has been around for centuries.\nThe ancient Incas of Peru used mountain peaks along the Andes as natural food\npreservers. The extremely cold temperatures and low pressure at those high altitudes\nprevented food from spoiling in the same basic way as a modern freeze-drying machine\nand a freezer.\n \n2",
