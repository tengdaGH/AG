  "passage_text": "Reading Practice\n \nThe success of cellulose\n \n{A} Not too long ago many investors made the bet that renewable fuels from bio-mass\nwould be the next big thing in energy. Converting corn, sugarcane, and soybeans into\nethanol or diesel-type fuels lessens our nation’s dependence on oil imports while cutting\ncarbon dioxide emissions. But already the nascent industry faces challenges. Escalating\ndemand is hiking food prices while farmers clear rainforest habitats to grow fuel crops. And\nseveral recent studies say that certain biofuel-production processes either fail to yield net\nenergy gains or release more carbon dioxide than they use.\n{B} A successor tier of start-up ventures aims to avoid those problems. Rather than\nfocusing on the starches, sugars, and fats of food crops, many of the prototype bioethanol\nprocesses work with lignocellulose, the “woody” tissue that strengthens the cell walls of\nplants, says University of Massachusetts Amherst chemical engineer George W. Huber.\nAlthough cellulose breaks down less easily than sugars and starches and thus requires a\ncomplex series of enzyme-driven chemical reactions, its use opens the industry to nonfood\nplant feedstocks such as agricultural wastes, wood chips, and switchgrass. But no\ncompany has yet demonstrated a cost-competitive industrial process for making cellulosic\nbiofuels.\n{C} So scientists and engineers are working on dozens of possible biofuel-processing\nroutes, reports Charles Wyman, a chemical engineer at the University of California,\nRiverside, who is a founder of Mascoma Corporation in Cambridge, Mass., a leading\ndeveloper of cellulosic ethanol processing.” There’s no miracle process out there,” he\nremarks. And fine-tuning a process involves considerable money and time. “The oil\ncompanies say that it takes 10 years to fully commercialize an industrial processing route,”\nwarns Huber, who has contributed some thermochemical techniques to another biomass\nstart-up, Virent Energy Systems in Madison, Wis. \n \n{D} One promising biofuel procedure that avoids the complex enzymatic chemistry to break\ndown cellulose is now being explored by Coskata in Warrenville, Ill., a firm launched in\n2006 by high-profile investors and entrepreneurs (General Motors recently took a minority\nstake in it as well). In the Coskata operation, a conventional gasification system will use\nheat to turn various feedstocks into a mixture of carbon monoxide and hydrogen called\nsyngas, says Richard Tobey, vice president of Engineering and R&D. The ability to handle\nmultiple plant feedstocks would boost the flexibility of the overall process because each\nregion in the country has access to certain feedstocks but not others.\n{E} Instead of using thermochemical methods to convert the syngas to fuel- a process that\ncan be significantly more costly because of the added expense of pressurizing gases,\naccording to Tobey – the Coskata group chose a biochemical route. The group focused on\nfive promising strains of ethanol-excreting bacteria that Ralph Tanner, a microbiologist at\nthe University of Oklahoma, had discovered years before in the oxygen-free sediments of a\nswamp. These anaerobic bugs make ethanol by voraciously consuming syngas. \n{F} The “heart and soul of the Coskata process,” as Tobey puts it, is the bioreactor in which\nthe bacteria live. “Rather than searching for food in the fermentation mash in a large tank,\n \n1\n\n \nour bacteria wait for the gas to be delivered to them,” he explains. The firm relies on plastic\ntubes, the filter-fabric straws as thin as human hair. The syngas flows through the straws,\nand water is pumped across their exteriors. The gases diffuse across the selective\nmembrane to the bacteria embedded in the outer surface of the tubes, which permits no\nwater inside. “We get an efficient mass transfer with the tubes, which is not easy,” Tobey\nsays. “Our data suggest that in an optimal setting we could get 90 percent of the energy\nvalue of the gases into our fuel.” After the bugs eat the gases, they release ethanol into the\nsurrounding water. Standard distillation or filtration techniques could extract the alcohol\nfrom the water.\n{G} Coskata researchers estimate that their commercialized process could deliver ethanol\nat under $1 per gallon-less than half of today’s $2-per-gallon wholesale price, Tobey\nclaims. Outside evaluators of Argonne National Laboratory measured the input-output\n“energy balance” of the Coskata process and found that, optimally, it can produce 7.7 times\nas much energy in the end product as it takes to make it.\n{H} The company plans to construct a 40,000-gallon-a-year pilot plant near the GM test\ntrack in Milford, Mich., by the end of this year and hopes to build a full-scale, 100-million-\ngallon-a-year plant by 2011. Coskata may have some company by then; Bioengineering\nResources in Fayetteville, Ark., is already developing what seems to be a similar three-step\npathway in which syngas is consumed by bacteria isolated by James Gaddy, a retired\nchemical engineer at the University of Arkansas. Considering the advances in these and\nother methods, plant cellulose could provide the greener ethanol everyone wants. \n \n2",
