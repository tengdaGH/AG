  "passage_text": "Reading Practice\n \nJohn Franklin: “the discovery of the slowness”\nA\nJohn Franklin (1786-1847) was the most famous vanisher of the Victorian era. He joined\nthe Navy as a midshipman at the age of 14 and fought in the battles of Copenhagen and\nTrafalgar. When peace with the French broke out. he turned his attention to, and in\nparticular to solve the conundrum of the Northwest Passage, the mythical clear-water route\nwhich would, if it existed, link the Atlantic and the Pacific Oceans above the northern coast\nof the American continent. The first expedition Franklin led to the Arctic was an arduous\noverland journey from Hudson Bay to the shores of the so-called Polar Ocean east of the\nCoppermine River. Between 1819 and 1822. Franklin and his twenty-strong team covered\n5550 miles on foot. Their expedition was a triumph of surveying – they managed to chart\nhundreds of miles of previously unknown coastline.\nB\nThere followed a career as a travel writer and salon-goer {‘the man who ate his boots’ was\nFranklin’s tag-line), a second long Arctic expedition, and a controversial spell as Governor\nof Van Diemen’s Land. Then, in May 1845, Franklin set off with two ships – the Erebus and\nthe Terror – and 129 men on the voyage that would kill him. In July, the convoy was seen\nby two whalers, entering Lancaster Sound. Nothing more would be heard of it for 14 years.\nHad the ships sunk or been iced in? Were the men dead, or in need of rescue? Or had they\nbroken through to the legendary open polar sea, beyond the ‘ice barrier’?\nC\nIn his personal correspondence and in his published memoirs. Franklin comes across as a\nman dedicated to the external duties of war and exploration, who kept introspection and\nself-analysis to a minimum. His blandness makes him an amenably malleable subject for a\nnovelist, and Sten Nadolny has taken full advantage of this licence. Most important, he has\nendowed his John Franklin with a defining character trait for which there is no historical\nevidence: (‘slowness’, or ‘calmness’).\nD\nSlowness influences not only Franklin’s behaviour but also his vision, his thought and his\nspeech. The opening scene of The Discovery of Slowness (The Discovery of Slowness by\nSten Nadolny) – depicts Franklin as a young boy. playing catch badly because his reaction\ntime is too slow. Despite the bullying of his peers, Franklin resolves not to fall into step with\n‘their way of doing things’. For Nadolny. Franklin’s fated fascination with the Arctic stems\nfrom his desire to find an environment suited to his peculiar slowness.\nE\nHe describes Franklin as a boy dreaming of the ‘open water and the time without hours and\ndays’ which exist in the far north, and of finding in the Arctic a place ‘where nobody would\nfind him too slow’. Ice is a slow mover. Ice demands a corresponding patience from those\nwho venture onto it. The explorers who have thrived at high latitude and at high altitudes\nhaven’t usually been men of great speed. They have tended instead to demonstrate\nunusual self-possession, a considerable capacity for boredom, and a talent for what the\n \n1\n\nScots call ‘tholing’, the uncomplaining endurance of suffering.\nF\nThese were all qualities which the historical Franklin possessed in abundance, and so\nNadolny’s concentration and exaggeration of them isn’t unreasonable. Even as an adult,\nhis slowness of thought means that he is unable to speak fluently, so he memorises ‘entire\nfleets of words and batteries of response’, and speaks a languid, bric-a-brac language. In\nthe Navy, his method of thinking first and acting later initially provokes mockery from his\nfellow sailors. But Franklin persists in doing things his way. and gradually earns the respect\nof those around him. To a commodore who tells him to speed up his report of an\nengagement, he replies: ‘When I tell something, sir. I use my own rhythm.’ A lieutenant\nsays approvingly of him: ’Because Franklin is so slow, he never loses time.’\nG\nSince it was first published in Germany in 1983. The Discovery of Slowness has sold more\nthan a million copies and been translated into 13 languages. It has been named as one of\nGerman literature’s twenty ‘contemporary classics’, and it has been as a manual and by\nEuropean pressure groups and institutions representing causes as diverse as sustainable\ndevelopment, the Protestant Church, management science, motoring policy and pacifism.\nH\nThe various groups that have taken the novel up have one thing in common: a dislike of the\nhigh-speed culture of Postmodernity. Nadolny’s Franklin appeals to them because he is\nimmune to ‘the compulsion to be constantly occupied’, and to the idea that ‘someone was\nbetter if he could do the same thing fast.’ Several German churches have used him in their\nsymposia and focus groups as an example of peacefulness, piety and self-confidence. A\ncentre scheme (a ‘march of slowness’ or ‘of the slow’), inspired by the novel. Nadolny has\nappeared as a guest speaker for RIO, a Lucerne-based organisation which aims to\nreconcile management principles with ideas of environmental sustainability. The novel has\neven become involved in the debate about speed limits on German roads. Drive down an\nautobahn today, and you will see large road-side signs proclaiming ‘unhurriedness’ a\nslogan which deliberately plays off the title of the novel.\nI\nA management journal in the US described The Discovery of Slowness is a ‘major event\nnot only for connoisseurs of fine historical fiction but also for those of us who concern\nthemselves with leadership, communication and systems-thinking, issues’. It’s easy to see\nwhere the attraction lies for the management crowd. The novel is crammed with quotations\nabout time-efficiency, punctiliousness and profitability: ‘As a rule, there are always three\npoints in time: the right one. the lost one and the premature one’. ‘What did too late mean?\nThey hadn’t waited for it long enough, that’s what it meant.’\n \n2",
