  "passage_text": "Reading Practice\n \nLet's Go Bats\nA\nBats have a problem: how to find their way around in the dark.They hunt at night, and\ncannot use light to help them find prey and avoid obstacles. You might say that this is a\nproblem of their own making, one that they could avoid simply by changing their habits and\nhunting by day. But the daytime economy is already heavily exploited by other creatures\nsuch as birds. Given that there is a living to be made at night, and given that alternative\ndaytime trades are thoroughly occupied, natural selection has favoured bats that make a\ngo of the night-hunting trade. It is probable that the nocturnal trades go way back in the\nancestry of all mammals. In the time when the dinosaurs dominated the daytime economy,\nour mammalian ancestors probably only managed to survive at all because they found\nways of scraping a living at night. Only after the mysterious mass extinction of the\ndinosaurs about 65 million years ago were our ancestors able to emerge into the daylight in\nany substantial numbers.\nB\nBats have an engineering problem: how to find their way and find their prey in the absence\nof light. Bats are not the only creatures to face this difficulty today. Obviously the night-\nflying insects that they prey on must find their way about somehow. Deep-sea fish and\nwhales have little or no light by day or by night. Fish and dolphins that live in extremely\nmuddy water cannot see because, although there is light, it is obstructed and scattered by\nthe dirt in the water Plenty of other modern animals make their living in conditions where\nseeing is difficult or impossible.\nC\nGiven the questions of how to manoeuvre in the dark, what solutions might an engineer\nconsider? The first one that might occur to him is to manufacture light, to use a lantern or\na searchlight. Fireflies and some fish (usually with the help of bacteria) have the power\nto manufacture their own light, but the process seems to consume a large amount of\nenergy. Fireflies use their light for attracting mates.This doesn't require a prohibitive\namount of energy: a male’s tiny pinprick of light can be seen by a female from some\ndistance on a dark night, since her eyes are exposed directly to the light source itself.\nHowever using light to find one's own way around requires vastly more energy, since the\neyes have to detect the tiny fraction of the light that bounces off each part of the scene.\nThe light source must therefore be immensely brighter if it is to be used as a headlight to\nilluminate the path, than if it is to be used as a signal to others. In any event, whether or not\nthe reason is the energy expense, it seems to be the case that, with the possible exception\nof some weird deep-sea fish, no animal apart from man uses manufactured light to find its\nway about.\nD\nWhat else might the engineer think of? Well, blind humans sometimes seem to have an\nuncanny sense of obstacles in their path. It has been given the name 'facial vision’,\nbecause blind people have reported that it feels a bit like the sense of touch, on the face.\nOne report tells of a totally blind boy who could ride his tricycle at good speed round the\n \n1\n\nblock near his home, using facial vision. Experiments showed that, in fact, facial vision is\nnothing to do with touch or the front of the face, although the sensation may be referred to\nthe front of the face, like the referred pain in a phantom limb.The sensation of facial vision,\nit turns out, really goes in through the ears.\nBlind people, without even being aware of the fact, are actually using echoes of their own\nfootsteps and of other sounds, to sense the presence of obstacles. Before this was\ndiscovered, engineers had already built instruments to exploit the principle, for example to\nmeasure the depth of the sea under a ship. After this technique had been invented, it was\nonly a matter of time before weapons designers adapted it for the detection of submarines.\nBoth sides in the Second World War relied heavily on these devices, under such\ncodenames as Asdic (British) and Sonar (American), as well as Radar (American) or RDF\n(British), which uses radio echoes rather than sound echoes.\nE\nThe Sonar and Radar pioneers didn't know it then, but all the world now knows that bats, or\nrather natural selection working on bats, had perfected the system tens of millions of\nyears earlier; and their radar' achieves feats of detection and navigation that would strike\nan engineer dumb with admiration. It is technically incorrect to talk about bat 'radar', since\nthey do not use radio waves. It is sonar. But the underlying mathematical theories of radar\nand sonar are very similar; and much of our scientific understanding of the details of what\nbats are doing has come from applying radar theory to them.The American zoologist\nDonald Griffin, who was largely responsible for the discovery of sonar in bats, coined the\nterm 'écholocation' to cover both sonar and radar, whether used by animals or by human\ninstruments.\n \n2",
