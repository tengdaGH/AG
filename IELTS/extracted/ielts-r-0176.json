It is estimated that the north and southwest regions could hold enough energy in\nthe form of heat to provide power for millions of homes. In fact, up to a fifth of Britain’s\nenergy could be provided by this geothermal source. Extracting the heat and converting it\ninto electricity is difficult and expensive. Thousands of bore holes would be needed; but\nonce they were in place, the heat would keep regenerating indefinitely.\n \n1",
