  "passage_text": "Reading Practice\n \nMultitasking Debate\nMultitasking Debate\nCan you do them at the same time?\nA\nTalking on the phone while driving isn’t the only situation where we’re worse at multitasking\nthan we might like to think we are. New studies have identified a bottleneck in our brains\nthat some say means we are fundamentally incapable of true multitasking. If experimental\nfindings reflect real-world performance, people who think they are multitasking are probably\njust underperforming in all – or at best, all but one – of their parallel pursuits. Practice might\nimprove your performance, but you will never be as good as when focusing on one task at\na time.\nB\nThe problem, according to René Marois, a psychologist at Vanderbilt University in\nNashville, Tennessee, is that there’s a sticking point in the brain. To demonstrate this,\nMarois devised an experiment to locate it. Volunteers watch a screen and when a particular\nimage appears, a red circle, say, they have to press a key with their index finger. Different\ncoloured circles require presses from different fingers. Typical response time is about half a\nsecond, and the volunteers quickly reach their peak performance. Then they learn to listen\nto different recordings and respond by making a specific sound. For instance, when they\nhear a bird chirp, they have to say “ba”; an electronic sound should elicit a “ko”, and so on.\nAgain, no problem. A normal person can do that in about half a second, with almost no\neffort.\nC\nThe trouble comes when Marois shows the volunteers an image, and then almost\nimmediately plays them a sound. Now they’re flummoxed. “If you show an image and play\na sound at the same time, one task is postponed,” he says. In fact, if the second task is\nintroduced within the half-second or so it takes to process and react to the first, it will simply\nbe delayed until the first one is done. The largest dual-task delays occur when the two\ntasks are presented simultaneously; delays progressively shorten as the interval between\npresenting the tasks lengthens.\nD\nThere are at least three points where we seem to get stuck, says Marois. The first is in\nsimply identifying what we’re looking at. This can take a few tenths of a second, during\nwhich time we are not able to see and recognise a second item. This limitation is known as\nthe “attentional blink”: experiments have shown that if you’re watching out for a particular\nevent and a second one shows up unexpectedly any time within this crucial window of\nconcentration, it may register in your visual cortex but you will be unable to act upon it.\nInterestingly, if you don’t expect the first event, you have no trouble to respond to the\nsecond. What exactly causes the attentional blink is still a matter for debate.\n \n1\n\nE\nA second limitation is in our short-term visual memory. It’s estimated that we can keep\ntrack of about four items at a time, fewer if they are complex. This capacity shortage is\nthought to explain, in part, our astonishing inability to detect even huge changes in scenes\nthat are otherwise identical, so-called “change blindness”. Show people pairs of near-\nidentical photos – say, aircraft engines in one picture have disappeared in the other – and\nthey will fail to spot the differences. Here again, though, there is disagreement about what\nthe essential limiting factor really is. Does it come down to a dearth of storage capacity, or\nis it about how much attention a viewer is paying?\nF\nA third limitation is that choosing a response to a stimulus – braking when you see a child\nin the road, for instance, or replying when your mother tells you over the phone that she’s\nthinking of leaving your dad – also takes brainpower. Selecting a response to one of these\nthings will delay by some tenths of a second your ability to respond to the other. This is\ncalled the “response selection bottleneck” theory, first proposed in 1952.\nG\nBut David Meyer, a psychologist at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, doesn’t buy the\nbottleneck idea. He thinks dual-task interference is just evidence of a strategy used by the\nbrain to prioritise multiple activities. Meyer is known as something of an optimist by his\npeers. He has written papers with titles like “Virtually perfect time-sharing in dual-task\nperformance: Uncorking the central cognitive bottleneck”. His experiments have shown that\nwith enough practice – at least 2000 tries – some people can execute two tasks\nsimultaneously as competently as if they were doing them one after the other. He suggests\nthat there is a central cognitive processor that coordinates all this and, what’s more, he\nthinks it used discretion: sometimes it chooses to delay one task while completing another.\nH\nMarois agrees that practice can sometimes erase interference effects. He has found that\nwith just 1 hour of practice each day for two weeks, volunteers show a huge improvement\nat managing both his tasks at once. Where he disagrees with Meyer is in what the brain is\ndoing to achieve this. Marois speculates that practice might give us the chance to find less\ncongested circuits to execute a task – rather like finding trusty back streets to avoid heavy\ntraffic on main roads – effectively making our response to the task subconscious. After all,\nthere are plenty of examples of subconscious multitasking that most of us routinely\nmanage: walking and talking, eating and reading, watching TV and folding the laundry.\nI\nIt probably comes as no surprise that, generally speaking, we get worse at multitasking as\nwe age. According to Art Kramer at the University of Illinois at Urbana- Champaign, who\nstudies how ageing affects our cognitive abilities, we peak in our 20s. Though the decline is\nslow through our 30s and on into our 50s, it is there; and after 55, it becomes more\nprecipitous. In one study, he and his colleagues had both young and old participants do a\nsimulated driving task while carrying on a conversation. He found that while young drivers\ntended to miss background changes, older drivers failed to notice things that were highly\nrelevant. Likewise, older subjects had more trouble paying attention to the more important\n \n2\n\nparts of a scene than young drivers.\nJ\nIt’s not all bad news for over-55s, though. Kramer also found that older people can benefit\nfrom the practice. Not only did they learn to perform better, but brain scans also showed\nthat underlying that improvement was a change in the way their brains become active.\nWhile it’s clear that practice can often make a difference, especially as we age, the basic\nfacts remain sobering. “We have this impression of an almighty complex brain,” says\nMarois, “and yet we have very humbling and crippling limits.” For most of our history, we\nprobably never needed to do more than one thing at a time, he says, and so we haven’t\nevolved to be able to. Perhaps we will in future, though. We might yet look back one day on\npeople like Debbie and Alun as ancestors of a new breed of true multitaskers.\n \n3",
