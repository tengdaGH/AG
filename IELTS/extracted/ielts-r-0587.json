  "passage_text": "Reading Practice\n \nToxic Stress: A Slow Wear And Tear\nA. Our bodies are built to respond when under attack. When we sense danger, our brain\ngoes on alert, our heart rate goes up, and our organs flood with stress hormones like\ncortisol and adrenaline. We breathe faster, taking in more oxygen, muscles tense, our\nsenses are sharpened and beads of sweat appear. This combination of reactions to\nstress is also known as the \"fight-or-flight\" response because it evolved as a survival\nmechanism, enabling people and other mammals to react quickly to life-threatening\nsituations. The carefully orchestrated yet near-instantaneous sequence of hormonal\nchanges and physiological responses helps someone to fight the threat off or flee to\nsafety. Unfortunately, the body can also overreact to stressors that are not life-\nthreatening, such as traffic jams, work pressure, and family difficulties.\nB. That's all fine when we need to jump out of the way of a speeding bus, or when\nsomeone is following us down a dark alley. In those cases, our stress is considered\n\"positive\", because it is temporary and helps us survive. But our bodies sometimes\nreact in the same way to more mundane stressors, too. When a child faces constant\nand unrelenting stress, from neglect, or abuse, or living in chaos, the response stays\nactivated, and may eventually derail normal development. This is what is known as\n\"toxic stress\". The effects are not the same in every child, and can be buffered by the\nsupport of a parent or caregiver, in which case the stress is considered \"tolerable\".\nBut toxic stress can have profound consequences, sometimes even spanning\ngenerations. Figuring out how to address stressors before they change the brain and\nour immune and cardiovascular systems is one of the biggest questions in the field of\nchildhood development today.\nC. In 1998, two researchers, Vincent Felitti and Robert Anda, pioneered in publishing a\nstudy demonstrating that people who had experienced abuse or household\ndysfunction as children were more likely to have serious health problems, like cancer\nor liver diseases, and unhealthy lifestyle habits, like drinking heavily or using drugs as\nadults. This became known as the \"ACE Study,\" short for \"adverse childhood\nexperiences.\" Scientists have since linked more than a dozen forms of ACEs -\nincluding homelessness, discrimination, and physical, mental, and sexual abuse -\nwith a higher risk of poor health in adulthood.\nD.\nothers. Nevertheless, the pathways that link adversity in childhood with health\nproblems in adulthood lead back to toxic stress. As Jenny Anderson, senior reporter\nat Quartz, explains, \"when a child lives with abuse, neglect, or is witness to violence,\nhe or she is primed for that fight or flight all the time. The burden of that stress, which\nis known as 'allostatic load or overload,' referring to the wear and tear that results\nfrom either too much stress or from inefficient management of internal balance, eg,\nnot turning off the response when it is no longer needed, can damage small,\ndeveloping brains and bodies. A brain that thinks it is in constant danger has trouble\norganising itself, which can manifest itself later as problems of paying attention, or\nsitting still, or following instructions - all of which are needed for learning\".\nEvery child reacts to stress differently, and some are naturally more resilient than\n \n1\n\nE. Toxic is a loaded word. Critics say the term is inherently judgmental and may appear\nto blame parents for external social circumstances over which they have little control.\nOthers say it is often misused to describe the source of stress itself rather than the\nbiological process by which it could negatively affect some children. The term, writes\nJohn Devaney, centenary chair of social work at the University of Edinburgh, \"can\nstigmatise individuals and imply traumatic happenings in the past\".\nSome paediatricians do not like the term because of how difficult it is to actually fix\nthe stressors their patients face, from poverty to racism. They feel it is too fatalistic to\ntell families that their child is experiencing toxic stress, and there is little they can do\nabout it. But Nadine Burke Harris, surgeon general of California, argues that naming\nthe problem means we can dedicate resources to it so that paediatricians feel like\nthey have tools to treat \"toxic stress\".\nF.\nThis can be tricky, especially if the source of the stress is the child's own family. But\nparent coaching, and connecting families with resources to help address the cause of\ntheir stress (sufficient food, housing insecurity, or even the parent's own trauma), can\nhelp. Another one is to ensure love and support from a parent or caregiver. Young\nchildren's stress responses are more stable, even in difficult situations, when they are\nwith an adult they trust.\nAs Megan Gunnar, a child psychologist and head of the Institute of Child at the\nUniversity of Minnesota, said: \"When the parent is present and relationship is secure,\nbasically the parent eats the stress: the kid cries, the parent comes, and it doesn't\nneed to kick in the big biological guns because the parent is the protective system\".\nThat is why Havard's Center on the Developing Child recommends offering care to\ncaregivers, like mental health or addiction support, because when they are healthy\nand well, they can better care for their children.\nThe most effective prevention for toxic stress is to reduce the source of the stress.\n \n2",
