  "passage_text": "Reading Practice\n \nReducing electricity consumption on the Isle of Eigg\nBackground\nThe Isle of Eigg is situated off the West Coast of Scotland, and is reached by ferry from the\nmainland. For the island community of about a hundred residents, it has always been\nexpensive to import products, materials and skilled labour from the mainland, and this has\nencouraged a culture of self-sufficiency and careful use of resources. Today, although the\nisland now has most modem conveniences, CO2 emissions per household are 20 percent\nlower than the UK average, and electricity use is 50 percent lower.\nWhen Eigg designed its electricity grid, which was switched on in February 2008, it quickly\nbecame apparent that in order to keep the capital building costs down, it would be\nnecessary to manage demand. This would also allow the island to generate most of its\nelectricity from renewable sources, mainly water, wind and solar power. This goal was\noverseen by the Eigg Heritage Trust (EHT).\n \nThe technology\nEigg manages electricity demand mainly by capping the instantaneous power that can be\nused to five kilowatts (kW) for a household and ten kW for a business. If usage goes over\nthe limit, the electricity supply is cut off and the maintenance team must be called to come\nand switch it back on again. All households and businesses have energy monitors, which\ndisplay current and cumulative electricity usage, and sound an alarm when consumption\nreaches a user-defined level, usually set a few hundred watts below the actual limit. The\nresult is that Eigg residents have a keen sense of how much power different electrical\nappliances use, and are careful to minimise energy consumption.\nDemand is also managed by warning the entire island when renewable energy generation\nis lower than demand, and diesel generators are operating to back it up - a so-called ‘red\nlight day’, as opposed to ‘green light days’ when there is sufficient renewable energy.\nResidents then take steps to temporarily reduce electricity demand further still, or postpone\ndemand until renewable energy generation has increased.\nEnergy use on the island has also been reduced through improved wall and loft insulation\nin homes, new boilers, solar water heating, carsharing and various small, energy-saving\nmeasures in households. New energy supplies are being developed, including sustainably\nharvested forests to supply wood for heating.\nEigg Heritage Trust has installed insulation in all of its own properties at no cost to the\ntenants, while private properties have paid for their own insulation to be installed. The\nsame applies for installations of solar water heating, although not all Trust properties have\nreceived this as yet. The Trust also operates a Green Grants scheme, where residents can\nclaim 50 percent of the cost of equipment to reduce carbon emissions, up to a limit of £300.\nPurchases included bikes, solar water heating, secondary glazing, thicker curtains, and\ngreenhouses to grow food locally, rather than importing it.\nEnvironmental benefits\n \n1\n\nPrior to the installation of the new electricity grid and renewable energy generation, most\nhouseholds on Eigg used-diesel generators to supply electricity, resulting in significant\ncarbon emissions. Homes were also poorly insulated and had old, inefficient oil-burning\nboilers, or used coal for heating.\nThe work by the Eigg Heritage Trust to reduce energy use has resulted in significant\nreductions in carbon emissions from the island’s households and businesses. The average\nannual electricity use per household is just 2,160 kilowatt hours (kWh), compared to a UK\naverage in 2008 of 4,198 kWh. Domestic carbon emissions have fallen by 47 percent, from\n8.4 to 4.45 tonnes per year. This compares to average UK household emissions of 5.5 to 6\ntonnes per year. The emissions should fall even further over the next few years as the\nsupply of wood for heating increases.\nSocial benefits\nThe completion of Eigg’s electricity grid has made a significant difference to the island’s\nresidents, freeing them from dependence on diesel generators and providing them with a\nstable and affordable power supply. A reliable electricity supply has brought improvements\nin other areas, for example, better treatment of drinking water in some houses, and the\nelimination of the constant noise of diesel generators. Improved home insulation and\nheating has also yielded benefits, making it more affordable to keep homes at a\ncomfortable temperature. One of the incentives for capping electricity use, rather than\ncharging different amounts according to usage, was to make access to energy equitable.\nEvery household has the same five kW cap, irrespective of income, so distributing the\navailable resources equally across the island’s population.\nEconomic and employment benefits\n \nEigg’s electricity grid supports four part-time maintenance jobs on the island, and residents\nhave also been employed for building work to improve Trust-owned houses and other\nbuildings. Likewise, the start of organised harvesting of wood for heating has created\nseveral forestry jobs for residents. A part-time ‘green project manager’ post has also been\ncreated. A wider economic impact has come from having a reliable and affordable\nelectricity supply, which has enabled several new businesses to start up, including\nrestaurants, shops, guest houses and self-catering accommodation. As Eigg has become\nknown for cutting carbon emissions and protecting the environment, an increasing number\nof visitors have come to the island to learn about its work, bringing a further economic\nbenefit to the residents.\n \n2",
