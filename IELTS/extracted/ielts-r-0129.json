  "passage_text": "Reading Practice\n \nDevelopmental Tasks of Normal Adolescence\nSome years ago, Professor Robert Havighurst of the University of Chicago, USA, proposed\nthat stages in human development can best be thought of in terms of the developmental\n‘tasks’ that are part of the normal transition. He identified ten developmental tasks\nassociated with the adolescent transition. Each of the Havighurst tasks can also be seen as\nelements of the overall sense of self that adolescents carry with them as they move\ntowards and into young adulthood. Adolescents do not progress through these multiple\ndevelopmental tasks separately; at any given time they may be dealing with several.\nThe adolescent must adjust to a new physical sense of self. At no other time since birth\ndoes an individual undergo such profound physical changes as during early adolescence.\nPuberty is marked by sudden rapid growth in height and weight. Also, the young person\nexperiences the emergence and accentuation of those physical traits that make the person\na boy or a girl. The young person looks less like a child and more like a physically mature\nadult. The effect of this rapid change is that mid-adolescents are body-conscious, and their\nconcerns are directed towards their opposite-sexed peers.\nThe adolescent must adjust to new intellectual abilities. In addition to a sudden spurt in\nphysical growth, adolescents experience a sudden increase in their ability to think about\ntheir world. As a normal part of maturity, they are able to think more things. However, they\nare also able to conceive of their world with awareness. Before adolescence, children's\nthinking is dominated by a concrete example for any problem that they solve; their thinking\nis constrained to what is real and physical. During adolescence, young people begin to\nrecognise and understand abstractions. The growth in ability to deal with abstractions\naccelerates during the middle stages of adolescence.\nThe adolescent must adjust to increased cognitive demands at school. Adults see high\nschool in part as a place where adolescents prepare for adult roles and responsibilities and\nin part as preparatory for further education. School curricula are frequently dominated by\nthe inclusion of more abstract, demanding material, regardless of whether the adolescents\nhave achieved formal thought. Since not all adolescents make the intellectual transition at\nthe same rate, demands for abstract thinking prior to the achievement of that ability may be\nfrustrating.\nThe adolescent must adopt a personal value system. During adolescence, as teens\ndevelop increasingly complex knowledge systems, they also adopt an integrated set of\nvalues and morals. During the early stages of moral development, parents provide their\nchild with a structured set of rules of what is right and wrong, what is acceptable and\nunacceptable. Eventually the adolescent must assess the parent's values as they come\ninto conflict with values expressed by peers and other segments of society. To reconcile\ndifferences, the adolescent restructures those beliefs into a personal ideology.\nThe adolescent must develop expanded verbal skills to accommodate more complex\nconcepts and tasks. Their limited language of childhood is no longer adequate. As their\nconceptual development may outstrip their verbal development, adolescents may appear\nless competent than they really are.\nThe adolescent must establish adult vocational goals. As part of the process of establishing\na personal identity, the adolescent must also begin the process of focusing on the question,\n \n1\n\n \n'What do you plan to be when you grow up?1 Mid-adolescents must identify, at least at a\npreliminary level, what their adult vocational goals are and how they intend to achieve\nthem.\nThe adolescent must develop a personal sense of identity. Prior to adolescence, one's\nidentity is an extension of one's parents' identity. During the early adolescent years a young\nperson begins to recognise their uniqueness and to establish themselves as separate\nindividuals, independent of their parents. As such, one must reconsider the answer to the\nquestion, ‘what does it mean to be me?' or \"who am l?\"\nThe adolescent must establish emotional and psychological independence from his or her\nparents, childhood is marked by strong dependence on one's parents. Adolescents may\nyearn to keep that safe, secure, supportive, dependent relationship. Yet, to be an adult\nimplies a sense of independence, of autonomy, of being one's own person. In an attempt to\nassert their need for independence and individuality, adolescents may respond with what\nappears to be hostility and lack of cooperation.\nThe adolescent must develop stable and productive peer relationships. Although peer\ninteraction is not unique to adolescence, it seems to hit a peak of importance during early\nadolescence. Certainly by late adolescence or early adulthood the need for peer approval\nhas diminished. This degree to which an adolescent is able to make friends and have an\naccepting peer group, though, is a major indicator of how well the adolescent will adjust in\nother areas of social and psychological development. Early adolescence is also a period of\nintense conformity to peers.” Fitting in' not being different, and being accepted seem\nsomehow pressing to this age group. The worst possibility, from the view of the young teen,\nis to be seen by peers as different.\nThe adolescent must develop increased impulse control and behavioural maturity. In their\nshift to adulthood, most young people engage in one or more behaviours that place them at\nphysical, social, or educational risk. Risky behaviours are sufficiently pervasive among\nadolescents to suggest that risk-taking may be a normal developmental process of middle\nadolescence. Gradually adolescents develop a set of behavioural self-controls through\nwhich they assess which behaviours are acceptable and adult-like.\n \n2",
