  "passage_text": "Reading Practice\n \nGrowing up in New Zealand\nIt has long been known that the first one thousand days of life are the most critical in\nensuring a person’s healthy future; precisely what happens during this period to any\nindividual has been less well documented. To allocate resources appropriately, public\nhealth and education policies need to be based upon quantifiable data, so the New\nZealand Ministry of Social Development began a longitudinal study of these early days,\nwith the view to extending it for two decades. Born between March 2009 and May 20I0, the\n6,846 babies recruited came from a densely populated area of New Zealand, and it is\nhoped they will be followed until they reach the age of 21.\nBy 2014, fur reports, collectively known as Growing Up in New Zealand (GUiNZ), had been\npublished, showing New Zealand to be a complex, changing country, with the participants\nand their families’ being markedly dierent from those of previous generations.\n \nOf the 6,846 babies, the majority were identified as European New Zealanders, but one\nquarter was Maori (indigenous New Zealanders), 20% were Pacific (originating in islands in\nthe Pacific), and one in six were Asian. Almost 50% of the children had more than one\nethnicity.\nThe first three reports of GUiNZ ae descriptive, portraying the cohort before birth, at nine\nmonths, and at two years of age. Already, the first report, Before we are born, has made\nhistory as it contains interviews with the children’s mothers and fathers. The fourth report,\nwhich is more analytical, explores the definition of vulnerability for children in their first one\nthousand days.\nBefore we are born, published in 2010, describes the hopes, dreams, and realities that\nprospective parents have. It shows that the average age of both parents having a child was\n30, and around two-thirds of parents were in legally binding relationships. However, one-\nthird of the children were born to either a mother or a father who did not grow up in New\nZealand – a significant dierence from previous longitudinal studies in which a vast majority\nof parents were New Zealanders born and bred. Around 60% of the births in the cohort\nwere planned, and most families hoped to have two or three children. During pregnancy,\nsome women changed their behaviour, with regard to smoking, alcohol, and exercise, but\nmany did not. Such information will be useful for public health campaigns.\nNow we are born is the second report. Fifty-two percent of its babies were male and 48%\nfemale, with nearly a quarter delivered by caesarean section. The World Health\nOrganisation and New Zealand guidelines recommend babies be breastfed exclusively for\nsix months, but the median age for this in the GUiNZ cohort was fur months since almost\none-third of mothers had returned to full-time work. By nine months, the babies were all\neating solid food. While 54% of them were living in accommodation their families owned,\ntheir parents had almost all experienced a drop in income, sometimes a steep one, mostly\ndue to mothers’ not working. Over 90% of the babies were immunised, and almost all were\nin very good health. Of the mothers, however, 11% had experienced post-natal depression\n– an alarming statistic, perhaps, but, once again, useful for mental health campaigns. Many\nof the babies were put in childcare while their mothers worked or studied, and the providers\nvaried by ethnicity: children who were Maori or Pacific were more likely to be looked after\n \n1\n\n \nby grandparents; European New Zealanders tended to be sent to daycare.\nNow we are two, the third report, provides more insights into the children’s development –\nphysically, emotionally, behaviourally, and cognitively. Major changes in home\nenvironments are documented, like the socio-economic situation, and childcare\narrangements. Information was collected both from direct observations of the children and\nfrom parental interviews. Once again, a high proportion of New Zealand two-year-olds were\nin very good health. Two-thirds of the children knew their gender, and used their own name\nor expressed independence in some way. The most common first word was a variation on\n‘Mum’, and the most common favourite first food was a banana. Bilingual or multi-lingual\nchildren were in a large minority of 40%. Digital exposure was high: one in seven two-year-\nolds had used a laptop or a children’s computer, and 80% watched TV or DVDs daily; by\ncontrast, 66% had books read to them each day.\nThe fourth report evaluates twelve environmental risk factors that increase the likelihood of\npoor developmental outcomes for children and draws on experiences in Western Europe,\nwhere the specific factors were collated. This, however, was the first time for their use in a\nNew Zealand context. The factors include: being born to an adolescent mother; having one\nor both parents on income-tested benefits; and, living in cramped conditions.\nIn addition to descriptive ones, future reports will focus on children who move in and out of\nvulnerability to see how these transitions aect their later life.\nTo date, GUiNZ has been highly successful with only a very small dropout rate for\nparticipants – even those living abroad, predominantly in Australia, have continued to\nprovide information. The portrait GUiNZ paints of a country and its people are indeed\nrevealing.\n \n2",
