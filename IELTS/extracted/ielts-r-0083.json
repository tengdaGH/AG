  "passage_text": "Reading Practice\n \nCan Scientists tell us: What happiness is?\nA\nEconomists accept that if people describe themselves as happy, then they are happy.\nHowever, psychologists differentiate between levels of happiness. The most immediate\ntype involves a feeling; pleasure or joy. But sometimes happiness is a judgment that life is\nsatisfying, and does not imply an emotional state. Esteemed psychologist Martin Seligman\nhas spearheaded an effort to study the science of happiness. The bad news is that we’re\nnot wired to be happy. The good news is that we can do something about it. Since its\norigins in a Leipzig laboratory 130 years ago, psychology has had little to say about\ngoodness and contentment. Mostly psychologists have concerned themselves with\nweakness and misery. There are libraries full of theories about why we get sad, worried,\nand angry. It hasn’t been respectable science to study what happens when lives go well.\nPositive experiences, such as joy, kindness, altruism and heroism, have mainly been\nignored. For every 100 psychology papers dealing with anxiety or depression, only one\nconcerns a positive trait.\nB\nA few pioneers in experimental psychology bucked the trend. Professor Alice Isen of\nCornell University and colleagues have demonstrated how positive emotions make people\nthink faster and more creatively. Showing how easy it is to give people an intellectual\nboost, Isen divided doctors making a tricky diagnosis into three groups: one received\ncandy, one read humanistic statements about medicine, one was a control group. The\ndoctors who had candy displayed the most creative thinking and worked more efficiently.\nInspired by Isen and others, Seligman got stuck in. He raised millions of dollars of research\nmoney and funded 50 research groups involving 150 scientists across the world. Four\npositive psychology centres opened, decorated in cheerful colours and furnished with sofas\nand baby-sitters. There were get-togethers on Mexican beaches where psychologists\nwould snorkel and eat fajitas, then form “pods” to discuss subjects such as wonder and\nawe. A thousand therapists were coached in the new science.\nC\nBut critics are demanding answers to big questions. What is the point of defining levels of\nhaziness and classifying the virtues? Aren’t these concepts vague and impossible to pin\ndown? Can you justify spending funds to research positive states when there are problems\nsuch as famine, flood and epidemic depression to be solved? Seligman knows his work\ncan be belittled alongside trite notions such as “the power of positive thinking”. His plan to\nstop the new science floating “on the waves of self- improvement fashion” is to make sure it\nis anchored to positive philosophy above, and to positive biology below.\nD\nAnd this takes us back to our evolutionary past Homo sapiens evolved during the\nPleistocene era (1.8 m to 10,000 years ago), a time of hardship and turmoil. It was the Ice\nAge, and our ancestors endured long freezes as glaciers formed, then ferocious floods as\nthe ice masses melted. We shared the planet with terrifying creatures such as mammoths,\nelephant-sized ground sloths and sabre-toothed cats. But by the end of the Pleistocene, all\n \n1\n\nthese animals were extinct. Humans, on the other hand, had evolved large brains and used\ntheir intelligence to make fire and sophisticated tools, to develop talk and social rituals.\nSurvival in a time of adversity forged our brains into a persistent mould. Professor\nSeligman says: “Because our brain evolved during a time of ice, flood and famine, we have\na catastrophic brain. The way the brain works is looking for what’s wrong. The problem is,\nthat worked in the Pleistocene era. It favoured you, but it doesn’t work in the modem\nworld”.\nE\nAlthough most people rate themselves as happy, there is a wealth of evidence to show that\nnegative thinking is deeply ingrained in the human psyche. Experiments show that we\nremember failures more vividly than success. We dwell on what went badly, not what went\nwell. Of the six universal emotions, four anger, fear, disgust and sadness are negative and\nonly one, joy, is positive. (The sixth, surprise, is neutral). According to the psychologist\nDaniel Nettle, author of Happiness, and one of the Royal Institution lectures, the negative\nemotion each tells us “something bad has happened” and suggest a different course of\naction.\nF\nWhat is it about the structure of the brain that underlies our bias towards negative thinking?\nAnd is there a biology of joy? At Iowa University, neuroscientist studied what happens\nwhen people are shown pleasant and unpleasant pictures. When subjects see landscapes\nor dolphins playing, part of the frontal lobe of the brain becomes active. But when they are\nshown unpleasant images a bird covered in oil, or a dead soldier with part of his face\nmissing the response comes from more primitive parts of the brain. The ability to feel\nnegative emotions derives from an ancient danger-recognition system formed early in the\nbrain’s evolution. The pre-frontal cortex, which registers happiness, is the part used for\nhigher thinking, an area that evolved later in human history.\nG\nOur difficulty, according to Daniel Nettle, is that the brain systems for liking and wanting are\nseparate. Wanting involves two ancient regions the amygdala and the nucleus accumbens\nthat communicate using the chemical dopamine to form the brain’s reward system. They\nare involved in anticipating the pleasure of eating and in addiction to drugs. A rat will press\na bar repeatedly ignoring sexually available partners, to receive electrical stimulation of the\n“wanting” parts of the brain. But having received brain stimulation, the rat eats more but\nshows no sign of enjoying the food it craved. In humans, a drug like nicotine produces\nmuch craving but little pleasure.\nH\nIn essence, what the biology lesson tells us is that negative emotions are fundamental to\nthe human condition and it’s no wonder they are difficult to eradicate. At the same time, by\na trick of nature, our brains are designed to crave but never really achieve lasting\nhappiness.\n \n2",
