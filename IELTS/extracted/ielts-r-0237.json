  "passage_text": "Reading Practice\nJohnson's Dictionary\nFor the century before Johnson's Dictionary was published in 1775. there had been\nconcern about the state of the English language.There was no standard way of speaking or\nwriting and no agreement as to the best way of bringing some order to the chaos' of\nEnglish spelling. Dr Johnson provided the solution.\nThere had, of course, been dictionaries in the past, the first of these being a little book of\nsome 120 pages, compiled by a certain Robert Cawdray, published in 1604 under the title\nA Table Alphabetical! ‘of hard usual English wordes'. Like the various dictionaries that\ncame after it during the seventeenth century, Cawdray's tended to concentrate on\n'scholarly' words; one function of the dictionary was to enable its student to convey an\nimpression of fine learning.\nBeyond the practical need to make order out of chaos, the rise of dictionaries is associated\nwith the rise of the English middle class, who were anxious to define and circumscribe the\nvarious worlds to conquer - lexical as well as social and commercial. It is highly appropriate\nthat Dr Samuel Johnson, the very model of an eighteenth-century literary man, as famous\nin his own time as in ours, should have published his dictionary at the very beginning of the\nheyday of the middle class.\nJohnson was a poet and critic who raised common sense to the heights of genius. His\napproach to the problems that had worried writers throughout the late seventeenth and\nearly eighteenth centuries was intensely practical. Up until his time, the task of producing a\ndictionary on such a large scale had seemed impossible without the establishment of an\nacademy to make decisions about right and wrong usage Johnson decided he did not need\nan academy to settle arguments about language; he would write a dictionary himself; and\nhe would do it single-handed. Johnson signed the contract for the Dictionary with the\nbookseller Robert Dosley at a breakfast held at the Golden Anchor Inn near Holbom Bar on\n18 June 1764. He was to be paid £ 1.575 in instalments, and from this he took money to\nrent 17 Gough Square, in which he set up his 'dictionary workshop'.\nJames Boswell, his biographer described the garret where Johnson worked as ‘fitted up\nlike a counting house' with a long desk running down the middle at which the copying\nclerks would work standing up. Johnson himself was stationed on a rickety chair at an 'old\ncrazy deal table' surrounded by a chaos of borrowed books. He was also helped by six\nassistants, two of whom died whilst the Dictionary was still in preparation.\nThe work was immense; filling about eighty large notebooks (and without a library to hand).\nJohnson wrote the definitions of over 40,000 words, and illustrated their many meanings\nwith some I 14.000 quotations drawn from English writing on every subject, from the\nElizabethans to his own time. He did not expect to achieve complete originality. Working to\na deadline, he had to draw on the best of all previous dictionaries, and to make his work\none of heroic synthesis. In fact it was very much more. Unlike his predecessors.Johnson\ntreated English very practically, as a living language, with many different shades of\nmeaning. He adopted his definitions on the principle of English common law - according to\nprecedent. After its publication, his Dictionary was not seriously rivalled for over a century.\nAfter many vicissitudes the Dictionary was finally published on 15 April 1775. It was\ninstantly recognised as a landmark throughout Europe. This very noble work.’ wrote the\n \n1\n\nleading Italian lexicographer;‘will be a perpetual monument of Fame to the Author, an\nHonour to his own Country in particular, and a general Benefit to the republic of Letters\nthroughout Europe.' The fact that Johnson had taken on the Academies of Europe and\nmatched them (everyone knew that forty French academics had taken forty years to\nproduce the first French national dictionary) was cause for much English celebration.\nJohnson had worked for nine years.‘with little assistance of the learned, and without any\npatronage of the great; not in the soft obscurities of retirement, or under the shelter of\nacademic bowers, but amidst inconvenience and distraction, in sickness and in sorrow'. For\nall its faults and eccentricities his two-volume work is a masterpiece and a landmark, in his\nown words, 'setting the orthography, displaying the analogy, regulating the structures, and\nascertaining the significations of English words’. It is the corner-stone of Standard English,\nan achievement which, in James Boswell’s words,‘conferred stability on the language of his\ncountry'.\nThe Dictionary, together with his other writing, made Johnson famous and so well\nesteemed that his friends were able to prevail upon King George III to offer him a pension.\nFrom then on, he was to become the Johnson of folklore. \n \n2",
