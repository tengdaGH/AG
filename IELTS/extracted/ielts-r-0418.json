Trees and shrubs take root in them. Prospectors mine\nthem, looking for specks of gold carried up by termites from hundreds of metres below. And\nof course, they are a special treat to aardvarks and other insectivores.\nNow, Africa is paying an offbeat tribute to these towers of mud. The extraordinary\nEastgate Building in Harare, Zimbabwe’s capital city, is said to be the only one in the world\nto use the same cooling and heating principles as the termite mound.\nTermites in Zimbabwe build gigantic mounds inside which they farm a fungus that is their\nprimary food source. This must be kept at exactly 30.5°C, while the temperatures on the\nAfrican yeld outside can range from 1.5°C at night only just above freezing to a baking hot\n40°C during the day. The termites achieve this remarkable feat by building a system of\nvents in the mound. Those at the base lead down into chambers cooled by wet mud carried\nup from water tables far below, and others lead up through a Hue to the peak of the\nmound. By constantly opening and closing these heating and cooling vents over the course\nof the day the termites succeed in keeping the temperature constant in spite of the wide\nfluctuations outside.\nArchitect Mick Pearce used precisely the same strategy when designing the Eastgate\nBuilding, which has no air conditioning and virtually no heating. The building the country's\nlargest commercial and shopping complex uses less than I0% of the energy of a\nconventional building ns size. These efficiencies translated directly to the bottom line: the\nEastgate’s owners saved $3.5 million on a $36 million building because an air- conditioning\nplant didn't have to be imported. These savings were also passed on to tenants: rents are\n20% lower than in a new building next door.\nThe complex is actually two buildings linked by bridges across a shady, glass-roofed atrium\nopen to the breezes. Fans suck fresh air in from the atrium, blow it upstairs through hollow\nspaces under the floors and from there into each office through baseboard vents. As it rises\nand warms, it is drawn out via ceiling vents and finally exits through forty- eight brick\nchimneys.\nTo keep the harsh, high yeld sun from heating the interior, no more than 25% of the outside\nis glass, and all the windows are screened by cement arches that just out more than a\nmetre.\nDuring summer’s cool nights, big fans flush air through the building seven times an hour to\nchill the hollow floors. By day, smaller fans blow two changes of air an hour through the\nbuilding, to circulate the air which has been in contact with the cool floors. For winter days,\nthere are small heaters in the vents.\nThis is all possible only because Harare is 1600 feet above sea level, has cloudless skies,\nlittle humidity and rapid temperature swings days as warm as 3l°C commonly drop to 14°C\nat night. ‘You couldn’t do this in New York, with its fantastically hot summers and\nfantastically cold winters,’ Pearce said. But then his eyes lit up at the challenge.' Perhaps\n \n1\n\nyou could store the summer's heat in water somehow.\nThe engineering firm of Ove Amp & Partners, which worked with him on the design,\nmonitors daily temperatures outside, under the floors and at knee, desk and ceiling level.\nOve Arup's graphs show that the temperature of the building has generally stayed between\n23\"C and 25°C. with the exception of the annual hot spell just before the summer rains in\nOctober, and three days in November, when a janitor accidentally switched off the fans at\nnight. The atrium, which funnels the winds through, can be much cooler. And the air is\nfresh far more so than in air-conditioned buildings, where up to 30% of the air is recycled.\nPearce, disdaining smooth glass skins as ‘igloos in the Sahara’, calls his building, with its\nexposed girders and pipes, ‘spiky’.
