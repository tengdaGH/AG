  "passage_text": "Reading Practice\n \nVisual Symbols and the Blind\nPart 1 \nFrom a number of recent studies, it has become clear that blind people can appreciate the\nuse of outlines and perspectives to describe the arrangement of objects and other surfaces\nin space. But pictures are more than literal representations.\nThis fact was drawn to my attention dramatically when a blind woman in one of my\ninvestigations decided on her own initiative to draw a wheel as it was spinning. To show\nthis motion, she traced a curve inside the circle (Fig. 1). I was taken aback. Lines of motion,\nsuch as the one she used, are a very recent invention in the history of illustration. Indeed,\nas art scholar David Kunzle notes, Wilhelm Busch, a trend-setting nineteenth-century\ncartoonist, used virtually no motion lines in his popular figures until about 1877. Fig. 1\nWhen I asked several other blind study subjects to draw a spinning wheel, one particularly\nclever rendition appeared repeatedly: several subjects showed the wheel's spokes as\ncurved lines. When asked about these curves, they all described them as metaphorical\nways of suggesting motion. Majority rule would argue that this device somehow indicated\nmotion very well. But was it a better indicator than, say, broken or wavy lines - or any other\nkind of line, for that matter? The answer was not clear. So I decided to test whether various\nlines of motion were apt ways of showing movement or if they were merely idiosyncratic\nmarks. Moreover, I wanted to discover whether there were differences in how the blind and\nthe sighted interpreted lines of motion.\nTo search out these answers, I created raised-line drawings of five different wheels,\ndepicting spokes with lines that curved, bent, waved, dashed and extended beyond the\nperimeter of the wheel. I then asked eighteen blind volunteers to feel the wheels and\nassign one of the following motions to each wheel: wobbling, spinning fast, spinning\nsteadily, jerking or braking. My control group consisted of eighteen sighted undergraduates\nfrom the University of Toronto.\n \nAll but one of the blind subjects assigned distinctive motions to each wheel. Most guessed\nthat the curved spokes indicated that the wheel was spinning steadily; the wavy spokes,\nthey thought, suggested that the wheel was wobbling; and the bent spokes were taken as a\nsign that the wheel was jerking. Subjects assumed that spokes extending beyond the\nwheel's perimeter signified that the wheel had its brakes on and that dashed spokes\nindicated the wheel was spinning quickly.\n \nIn addition, the favoured description for the sighted was the favoured description for the\nblind in every instance. What is more, the consensus among the sighted was barely higher\nthan that among the blind. Because motion devices are unfamiliar to the blind, the task I\ngave them involved some problem solving. Evidently, however, the blind not only figured\nout meanings for each line of motion, but as a group they generally came up with the same\nmeaning at least as frequently as did sighted subjects.\nPart 2\n \n1\n\nWords associated\nwith circle/square\nAgreement\namong subjects\n(%)\nSOFT-HARD\n100\nMOTHER-FATHER\n94\nHAPPY-SAD\n94\nGOOD-EVIL\n89\nLOVE-HATE\n89\nALIVE-DEAD\n87\nBRIGHT-DARK\n87\nLIGHT-HEAVY\n85\nWARM-COLD\n81\nSUMMER-WINTER\n81\nWEAK-STRONG\n79\nFAST-SLOW\n79\nCAT-DOG\n74\nSPRING-FALL\n74\nQUIET-LOUD\n62\nWALKING-\nSTANDING\n62\nODD-EVEN\n57\nFAR-NEAR\n53\nPLANT-ANIMAL\n53\nDEEP-SHALLOW\n51\nFig. 2 Subjects were asked which word\nin each pair fits best with a circle and which\nwith a square.

With Chang Hong Liu, a doctoral student from China, I have\nbegun exploring how well blind people understand the symbolism behind shapes such as\nhearts that do not directly represent their meaning.\nWe gave a list of twenty pairs of words to sighted subjects and asked them to pick from\n \n2\n\neach pair the term that best related to a circle and the term that best related to a square.\nFor example, we asked: What goes with soft? A circle or a square? Which shape goes with\nhard?\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAll our subjects deemed the circle soft and the square hard. A full 94% ascribed happy to\nthe circle, instead of sad. But other pairs revealed less agreement: 79% matched fast to\nslow and weak to strong, respectively. And only 51% linked deep to circle and shallow to\nsquare. (See Fig. 2.) When we tested four totally blind volunteers using the same list, we\nfound that their choices closely resembled those made by the sighted subjects. One man,\nwho had been blind since birth, scored extremely well. He made only one match differing\nfrom the consensus, assigning 'far' to square and 'near' to circle. In fact, only a small\nmajority of sighted subjects - 53% - had paired far and near to the opposite partners. Thus,\nwe concluded that the blind interpret abstract shapes as sighted people do.\n \n3",
