  "passage_text": "Reading Practice\n \nThe rocket - From East to West\nA\nThe concept of the rocket, or rather the mechanism behind the idea of propelling an object\ninto the air, has been around for well over two thousand years. However, it wasn’t until the\ndiscovery of the reaction principle, which was the key to space travel and so represents\none of the great milestones in the history of scientific thought, that rocket technology was\nable to develop. Not only did it solve a problem that had intrigued man for ages, but, more\nimportantly, it literally opened the door to exploration of the universe.\nB\nAn intellectual breakthrough, brilliant though it may be, does not automatically ensure that\nthe transition is made from theory to practice. Despite the fact that rockets had been used\nsporadically for several hundred years, they remained a relatively minor artefact of\ncivilisation until the twentieth century. Prodigious efforts, accelerated during two world\nwars, were required before the technology of primitive rocketry could be translated into the\nreality of sophisticated astronauts. It is strange that the rocket was generally ignored by\nwriters of fiction to transport their heroes to mysterious realms beyond the Earth, even\nthough it had been commonly used in fireworks displays in China since the thirteenth\ncentury. The reason is that nobody associated the reaction principle with the idea of\ntravelling through space to a neighbouring world.\nC\nA simple analogy can help us to understand how a rocket operates. It is much like a\nmachine gun mounted on the rear of a boat. In reaction to the backward discharge of\nbullets, the gun, and hence the boat, move forwards. A rocket motor’s ‘bullets’ are minute,\nhigh-speed particles produced by burning propellants in a suitable chamber. The reaction\nto the ejection of these small particles causes the rocket to move forwards. There is\nevidence that the reaction principle was applied practically well before the rocket was\ninvented. In his Noctes Atticae or Greek Nights, Aulus Gellius describes ‘the pigeon of\nArchytas’, an invention dating back to about 360 BC. Cylindrical in shape, made of wood,\nand hanging from string, it was moved to and fro by steam blowing out from small exhaust\nports at either end. The reaction to the discharging steam provided the bird with motive\npower.\nD\nThe invention of rockets is linked inextricably with the invention of ‘black powder’. Most\nhistorians of technology credit the Chinese with its discovery. They base their belief on\nstudies of Chinese writings or on the notebooks of early Europeans who settled in or made\nlong visits to China to study its history and civilisation. It is probable that, some time in the\ntenth century, black powder was first compounded from its basic ingredients of saltpetre,\ncharcoal and sulphur. But this does not mean that it was immediately used to propel\nrockets. By the thirteenth century, powder- propelled fire arrows had become rather\ncommon. The Chinese relied on this type of technological development to produce\nincendiary projectiles of many sorts, explosive grenades and possibly cannons to repel\ntheir enemies. One such weapon was the ‘basket of fire’ or, as directly translated from\n \n1\n\nChinese, the ‘arrows like flying leopards’. The 0.7 metre-long arrows, each with a long tube\nof gunpowder attached near the point of each arrow, could be fired from a long, octagonal-\nshaped basket at the same time and had a range of 400 paces. Another weapon was the\n‘arrow as a flying sabre’, which could be fired from crossbows. The rocket, placed in a\nsimilar position to other rocket-propelled arrows, was designed to increase the range. A\nsmall iron weight was attached to the 1.5m bamboo shaft, just below the feathers, to\nincrease the arrow’s stability by moving the centre of gravity to a position below the rocket.\nAt a similar time, the Arabs had developed the ‘egg which moves and burns’. This ‘egg’\nwas apparently full of gunpowder and stabilised by a 1.5m tail. It was fired using two\nrockets attached to either side of this tail.\nE\nIt was not until the eighteenth century that Europe became seriously interested in the\npossibilities of using the rocket itself as a weapon of war and not just to propel other\nweapons. Prior to this, rockets were used only in pyrotechnic displays. The incentive for the\nmore aggressive use of rockets came not from within the European continent but from far-\naway India, whose leaders had built up a corps of rocketeers and used rockets successfully\nagainst the British in the late eighteenth century. The Indian rockets used against the\nBritish were described by a British Captain serving in India as ‘an iron envelope about 200\nmillimetres long and 40 millimetres in diameter with sharp points at the top and a 3m-long\nbamboo guiding stick’. In the early nineteenth century the British began to experiment with\nincendiary barrage rockets. The British rocket differed from the Indian version in that it was\ncompletely encased in a stout, iron cylinder, terminating in a conical head, measuring one\nmetre in diameter and having a stick almost five metres long and constructed in such a way\nthat it could be firmly attached to the body of the rocket. The Americans developed a\nrocket, complete with its own launcher, to use against the Mexicans in the mid-nineteenth\ncentury. A long cylindrical tube was propped up by two sticks and fastened to the top of the\nlauncher, thereby allowing the rockets to be inserted and lit from the other end.
