Whatever its thread, the weaving of\nthis story was done with a prime purpose. The listeners must be kept listening. They must\nnot fall asleep. So, as the story went on, its audience should be sustained by one question\nabove all. What happens next?\nB\nThe first fireside stories in human history can never be known. They were kept in the heads\nof those who told them. This method of storage is not necessarily inefficient. From\ndocumented oral traditions in Australia, the Balkans and other parts of the world we know\nthat specialised storytellers and poets can recite from memory literally thousands of lines,\nin verse or prose, verbatim-word for word. But while memory is rightly considered an art in\nitself, it is clear that a primary purpose of making symbols is to have a system of reminders\nor mnemonic cues – signs that assist us to recall certain information in the mind’s eye.\nC\nIn some Polynesian communities, a notched memory stick may help to guide a storyteller\nthrough successive stages of recitation. But in other parts of the world, the activity of\nstorytelling historically resulted in the development or even the invention of writing systems.\nOne theory about the arrival of literacy in ancient Greece, for example, argues that the epic\ntales about the Trojan War and the wanderings of Odysseus – traditionally attributed to\nHomer – were just so enchanting to hear that they had to be preserved. So the Greeks,\nc.750-700BC, borrowed an alphabet from their neighbors in the eastern Mediterranean, the\nPhoenicians.\nD\nThe custom of recording stories on parchment and other materials can be traced in many\nmanifestations around the world, from the priestly papyrus archives of ancient Egypt to the\nbirch-bark scrolls on which the North American Ojibway Indians set down their creation-\nmyth. It is a well-tried and universal practice: so much so that to this day storytime is\nprobably most often associated with words on paper. The formal practice of narrating a\nstory aloud would seem-so we assume to have given way to newspapers, novels and\ncomic strips. This, however, is not the case. Statistically, it is doubtful that the majority of\nhumans currently rely upon the written word to get access to stories. So what is the\nalternative source?\nE\nEach year, over 7 billion people will go to watch the latest offering from Hollywood,\nBollywood and beyond. The supreme storyteller of today is cinema. The movies, as distinct\nfrom still photography, seem to be an essential modem phenomenon. This is an illusion, for\nthere are, as we shall see, certain ways in which the medium of film is indebted to very old\nprecedents of arranging ‘sequences’ of images. But any account of visual storytelling must\n \n1\n\nbe with the recognition that all storytelling beats with a deeply atavistic pulse: that is, a\n‘good story’ relies upon formal patterns of plot and characterisation that have been\nembedded in the practice of storytelling over many generations.\nF\nThousands of scripts arrive every week at the offices of the major film studios. But aspiring\nscreenwriters really need to look no further for essential advice then the fourth-century BC\nGreek Philosopher Aristotle. He left some incomplete lecture notes on the art of telling\nstories in various literary and dramatic modes, a slim volume known as The Poetics.\nThough he can never have envisaged the popcorn-fuelled actuality of a multiplex cinema,\nAristotle is almost prescient about the key elements required to get the crowds flocking to\nsuch a cultural hub. He analyzed the process with cool rationalism. When a story enchants\nus, we lose the sense of where we are; we are drawn into the story so thoroughly that we\nforget it is a story being told. This is, in Aristotle’s phrase, ‘the suspension of disbelief.\nG\nWe know the feeling. If ever we have stayed in our seats, stunned with grief, as the credits\nroll by, or for days after seeing that vivid evocation of horror have been nervous about\ntaking a shower at home, then we have suspended disbelief. We have been caught, or\ncaptivated, in the storyteller’s web. Did it all really happen? We really thought so for a\nwhile. Aristotle must have witnessed often enough this suspension of disbelief. He taught at\nAthens, the city where theater developed as a primary form of civic ritual and recreation.\nTwo theatrical types of storytelling, tragedy and comedy, caused Athenian audiences to\nlose themselves in sadness and laughter respectively. Tragedy, for Aristotle, was\nparticularly potent in its capacity to enlist and then purge the emotions of those watching\nthe story unfold on the stage, so he tried to identify those factors in the storyteller’s art that\nbrought about such engagement. He had, as an obvious sample for analysis, not only the\nfifth-century BC masterpieces of Classical Greek tragedy written by Aeschylus, Sophocles\nand Euripides. Beyond them stood Homer, whose stories even then had canonical status:\nThe Iliad and The Odyssey were already considered literary landmarks-stories by which all\nother stories should be measured. So what was the secret of Homer’s narrative art?\nH\nIt was not hard to find. Homer created credible heroes. His heroes belonged to the past,\nthey were mighty and magnificent, yet they were not, in the end, fantasy figures. He made\nhis heroes sulk, bicker, cheat and cry. They were, in short, characters – protagonists of a\nstory that an audience would care about, would want to follow, would want to know what\nhappens next.
