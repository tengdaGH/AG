  "passage_text": "Reading Practice\n \nPersistent bullying is one of the worst experiences a\nchild can face\nHow can it be prevented? Peter Smith, Professor of Psychology at the University of\nSheffield, directed the Sheffield Anti-Bullying Intervention Project, funded by the\nDepartment for Education\nHere he reports on his findings.\nA\nBullying can take a variety of forms, from the verbal - being taunted or called hurtful names\n- to the physical - being kicked or shoved - as well as indirect forms, such as being\nexcluded from social groups. A survey I conducted with Irene Whitney found that in British\nprimary schools up to a quarter of pupils reported experience of bullying, which in about\none in ten cases was persistent. There was less bullying in secondary schools, with about\none in twenty-five suffering persistent bullying, but these cases may be particularly\nrecalcitrant.\nB\nBullying is clearly unpleasant, and can make the child experiencing it feel unworthy and\ndepressed. In extreme cases it can even lead to suicide, though this is thankfully rare.\nVictimised pupils are more likely to experience difficulties with interpersonal relationships\nas adults, while children who persistently bully are more likely to grow up to be physically\nviolent, and convicted of anti-social offences.\nC\nUntil recently, not much was known about the topic, and little help was available to\nteachers to deal with bullying. Perhaps as a consequence, schools would often deny the\nproblem. ‘There is no bullying at this school’ has been a common refrain, almost certainly\nuntrue. Fortunately more schools are now saying: There is not much bullying here, but\nwhen it occurs we have a clear policy for dealing with it.’\nD\nThree factors are involved in this change. First is an awareness of the severity of the\nproblem. Second, a number of resources to help tackle bullying have become available in\nBritain. For example, the Scottish Council for Research in Education produced a package\nof materials, Action Against Bullying, circulated to all schools in England and Wales as well\nas in Scotland in summer 1992, with a second pack, Supporting Schools Against Bullying,\nproduced the following year. In Ireland, Guidelines on Countering Bullying Behaviour in\nPost-Primary Schools was published in 1993. Third, there is evidence that these materials\nwork, and that schools can achieve something. This comes from carefully conducted\n‘before and after’ evaluations of interventions in schools, monitored by a research team. In\nNorway, after an intervention campaign was introduced nationally, an evaluation of forty-\ntwo schools suggested that, over a two-year period, bullying was halved. The Sheffield\ninvestigation, which involved sixteen primary schools and seven secondary schools, found\nthat most schools succeeded in reducing bullying.\n \n1\n\nE\nEvidence suggests that a key step is to develop a policy on bullying, saying clearly what is\nmeant by bullying, and giving explicit guidelines on what will be done if it occurs, what\nrecords will be kept, who will be informed, what sanctions will be employed. The policy\nshould be developed through consultation, over a period of time - not just imposed from the\nhead teacher’s office! Pupils, parents and staff should feel they have been involved in the\npolicy, which needs to be disseminated and implemented effectively.\nOther actions can be taken to back up the policy. There are ways of dealing with the topic\nthrough the curriculum, using video, drama and literature. These are useful for raising\nawareness, and can best be tied in to early phases of development, while the school is\nstarting to discuss the issue of bullying. They are also useful in renewing the policy for new\npupils, or revising it in the light of experience. But curriculum work alone may only have\nshort-term effects; it should be an addition to policy work, not a substitute.\nThere are also ways of working with individual pupils, or in small groups. Assertiveness\ntraining for pupils who are liable to be victims is worthwhile, and certain approaches to\ngroup bullying such as 'no blame’, can be useful in changing the behaviour of bullying\npupils without confronting them directly, although other sanctions may be needed for those\nwho continue with persistent bullying.\nWork in the playground is important, too. One helpful step is to train lunchtime supervisors\nto distinguish bullying from playful fighting, and help them break up conflicts. Another\npossibility is to improve the playground environment, so that pupils are less likely to be led\ninto bullying from boredom or frustration.\nF\nWith these developments, schools can expect that at least the most serious kinds of\nbullying can largely be prevented. The more effort put in and the wider the whole school\ninvolvement, the more substantial the results are likely to be. The reduction in bullying -\nand the consequent improvement in pupil happiness - is surely a worthwhile objective.\n \n2",
