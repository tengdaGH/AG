  "passage_text": "Reading Practice\n \nThe Muscles in Our Body\nOur human body is made up of many muscles. All these muscles work together to help you\nmove. They form the muscle system. 650 muscles are wrapped around your bones. They\nbasically cover the bones like a blanket. Muscles are fastened to the bones by tough\nbands. These bands are called tendons. You can see your tendons when you wiggle your\nfinger. Moving your fingers back and forth makes your tendons move.\nThese muscles around the bone must be told when to move. They are controlled by your\nthinking. If you want to walk, talk or smile, you send a message to the brain. Your brain\npicks up the message. It receives it and processes it. Then it sends out an electrical signal\nthrough the nerves. The nerves make connections until the signal reaches the proper\nmuscle. This signal tells a muscle what it has to do. The muscle simply does exactly what\nthe brain tells it to do. When you jump, hundreds of muscles work to help you do that.\nMuscles work by contracting. They shorten and pull the bone to move the body. They\nalways pull and never push. Muscles work in pairs. One muscle pulls, while the other\nrelaxes. Then they switch around. For instance, when you move your forearm, you use one\npair of muscles. The muscles on the inside of your arm is the biceps. It contracts to make\nyou bend your arm. The muscle on the outside is the triceps. It relaxes when you bend your\narm. If you want to straighten your arm, the muscles switch roles. The biceps relaxes,\nwhereas the triceps contracts. The biceps and triceps are long and thread-like. The longest\nmuscle, the sartorius, helps you cross your legs. The shortest muscle is in your ear.\nHowever, you cannot control all your muscles. Some muscles work without you thinking\nabout them. This is the case with your heart muscle. Heart muscles are stripped and oval in\nshape. They are extremely powerful and pump your heart. This pumping motion gets the\nblood moving through your body. As well, the stomach muscle mixes food around in your\nstomach. Then it pushes the food through your intestines and into the blood system.\nStomach muscles are short and have pointed ends.\nMuscles work all the time. They even work when you are fast asleep. They keep your body\nfirm and strong. Therefore, it is important to be in good shape. You need to stay healthy so\nthat your muscles can remain powerful too. One thing that muscles need is good food.\nMuscles develop when they have protein. Milk, eggs, red meat, fish and beans are rich in\nprotein. A healthy diet includes these food types. Muscles also need to be exercised to\nremain firm and toned. Regular exercise makes your muscles bigger, strengthens your\nheart and lungs and makes you more flexible. Good ways to exercise our walking,\nswimming, cycling, dancing or playing soccer. These activities improve your stamina. If you\nhave good stamina, you can keep going for a long time without getting tired.\n \n1",
