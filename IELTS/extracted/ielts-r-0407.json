  "passage_text": "Reading Practice\n \nSport Science in Australia\nThe professional career paths available to graduates from courses relating to human\nmovement and sport science are as diverse as the graduate’s imagination. However,\nundergraduate courses with this type of content, in Australia as well as in most other\nWestern countries, were originally designed as preparation programmes for Physical\nEducation (PE) teachers.\nThe initial programmes commenced soon after the conclusion of World War II in the mid-\n1940s. One of the primary motives for these initiatives was the fact that, during the war\neffort, so many of the men who were assessed for military duty had been declared unfit.\nThe government saw the solution in the providing of Physical Education programmes in\nschools, delivered by better prepared and specifically educated PE teachers.\nLater, in the 1970s and early 1980s, the surplus of Australians graduating with a PE degree\nobliged institutions delivering this qualification to identify new employment opportunities for\ntheir graduates, resulting in the first appearance of degrees catering for recreation\nprofessionals. In many instances, this diversity of programme delivery merely led to\ndegrees, delivered by physical educators, as a sideline activity to the production of PE\nteachers.\nWhilst the need to produce Physical Education teachers remains a significant social need,\nand most developed societies demand the availability of quality leisure programmes for\ntheir citizens, the career options of graduates within this domain are still developing. The\ntwo most evident growth domains are in the area of the professional delivery of sport, and\nthe role of a physical lifestyle for community health.\nThe sports industry is developing at an unprecedented rate of growth. From a\nbusiness perspective, sport is now seen as an area with the potential for high returns. It is\nquite significant that the businessman Rupert Murdoch broadened his business base from\nmedia to sport, having purchased an American baseball team and an Australian Rugby\nLeague competition, as well as seeking opportunities to invest in an English football club.\nNo business person of such international stature would see fit to invest in sport unless he\nwas satisfied that this was a sound business venture with ideal revenue-generating\nopportunities.\nThese developments have confirmed sport as a business with professional management\nstructures, marketing processes, and development strategies in place. They have indicated\nnew and developing career paths for graduates of human movement science, sport\nscience, exercise science and related degrees. Graduates can now visualise career paths\nextending into such diverse domains as sport management, sport marketing, event and\nfacility management, government policy development pertaining to sport, sport journalism,\nsport psychology, and sport or athletic coaching.\nBusiness leaders will only continue their enthusiasm for sport if they receive returns for\ntheir money. Such returns will only be forthcoming if astute, enthusiastic and properly\neducated professionals are delivering the programs that earn appropriate financial returns.\nThe successful universities of the 21st century will be those that have responded to this\nchallenge by delivering such degrees.\n \n1\n\nA second professional growth area for this group of graduates is associated with\ncommunity health. The increasing demand for government expenditure within health\nbudgets is reaching the stage where most governments are simply unable to function in a\nmanner that is satisfying their constituents. One of the primary reasons for this problem is\nthe unhelpful emphasis on treatment in medical care programmes. Governments have\ntraditionally given their senior health official the title of ‘Minister for Health’, when in fact this\nofficer has functioned as ‘Minister for Sickness and the Construction of Hospitals’.\nGovernment focus simply has to change. If the change is not brought about for\nphilosophical reasons, it will occur naturally, because insufficient funding will be available to\naddress the ever-increasing costs of medical support.\nGraduates of human movement, exercise science and sport science have the potential to\nbecome major players in this shift in policy focus. It is these graduates who already have\nthe skills, knowledge and understanding to initiate community health education\nprogrammes to reduce cardio-vascular disease, to reduce medical dependency upon\ndiabetes, to improve workplace health leading to increased productivity, to initiate and\npromote programmes of activity for the elderly that reduce medical dependency, and to\nmaintain an active lifestyle for the unemployed and disadvantaged groups in society. This\nis the graduate that governments will be calling upon to shift the community focus from\nmedical dependency to healthy lifestyles in the decades ahead.\nThe career paths of these graduates are developing at a pace that is not evident in other\nprofessions. The contribution that these graduates can make to society, and the recognition\nof this contribution is at an unprecedented high, and all indications are that it will continue\nto grow.\n \n2",
