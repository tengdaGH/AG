  "passage_text": "Reading Practice\n \nCopy your neighbor\nA\nTHERE’S no animal that symbolises rainforest diversity quite as spectacularly as the\ntropical butterfly. Anyone lucky enough to see these creatures flitting between patches of\nsunlight cannot fail to be impressed by the variety of their patterns. But why do they display\nsuch colourful exuberance? Until recently, this was almost as pertinent a question as it had\nbeen when the 19th-century naturalists, armed only with butterfly nets and insatiable\ncuriosity, battle through the rainforests. These early explorers soon realised that although\nsome of the butterflies’ bright colours are there to attract a mate, others are warning\nsignals. They send out a message to any predators: “Keep off, we’re poisonous.” And\nbecause wearing certain patterns affords protection, other species copy them. Biologists\nuse the term “mimicry rings” for these clusters of impostors and their evolutionary idol.\nB\nBut here’s the conundrum. “Classical mimicry theory says that only a single ring should be\nfound in any one area,” explains George Beccaloni of the Natural History Museum, London.\nThe idea is that in each locality there should be just the one pattern that best protects its\nwearers. Predators would quickly learn to avoid it and eventually, all mimetic species in a\nregion should converge upon it. “The fact that this is patently not the case has been one of\nthe major problems in mimicry research,” says Beccaloni. In pursuit of a solution to the\nmystery of mimetic exuberance, Beccaloni set off for one of the mega centres for butterfly\ndiversity, the point where the western edge of the Amazon basin meets the foothills of the\nAndes in Ecuador. “It’s exceptionally rich, but comparatively well collected, so I pretty much\nknew what was there, says Beccaloni.” The trick was to work out how all the butterflies\nwere organised and how this related to mimicry.\nC\nWorking at the Jatun Sach Biological Research Station on the banks of the Rio Napo,\nBeccaloni focused his attention on a group of butterflies called ithomiines. These distant\nrelatives of Britain’s Camberwell Beauty are abundant throughout Central and South\nAmerica and the Caribbean. They are famous for their bright colours, toxic bodies and\ncomplex mimetic relationships. “They can comprise up to 85 per cent of the individuals in a\nmimicry ring and their patterns are mimicked not just by butterflies, but by other insects as\ndiverse as damselflies and true bugs,” says Philip DeVries of the Milwaukee Public\nMuseum’s Center for Biodiversity Studies.\nD\nEven though all ithomiines are poisonous, it is in their interests to evolve to look like one\nanother because predators that learn to avoid one species will also avoid others that\nresemble it. This is known as Müllerian mimicry. Mimicry rings may also contain insects\nthat are not toxic but gain protection by looking likes a model species that is: an adaptation\ncalled Batesian mimicry. So strong is an experienced predator’s avoidance response that\neven quite inept resemblance gives some protection. “Often there will be a whole series of\nspecies that mimic, with varying degrees of verisimilitude, a focal or model species,” says\nJohn Turner from the University of Leeds. “The results of these deceptions are some of the\n \n1\n\nmost exquisite examples of evolution known to science.” In addition to colour, many mimics\ncopy behaviours and even the flight pattern of their model species.\nE\nBut why are there so many different mimicry rings? One idea is that species flying at the\nsame height in the forest canopy evolve to look like one another. “It had been suggested\nsince the 1970s that mimicry complexes were stratified by flight height,” says DeVries. The\nidea is that wing colour patterns are camouflaged against the different patterns of light and\nshadow at each level in the canopy, providing the first line of defence against predators.”\nBut the light patterns and wing patterns don’t match very well,” he says. And observations\nshow that the insects do not shift in height as the day progresses and the light patterns\nchange. Worse still, according to DeVries, this theory doesn’t explain why the model\nspecies is flying at that particular height in the first place.\nF\n“When I first went out to Ecuador, I didn’t believe the flight height hypothesis and set out to\ntest it,” says Beccaloni. “A few weeks with the collecting net convinced me otherwise. They\nreally flew that way.” What he didn’t accept, however, was the explanation about light\npatterns. “I thought if this idea really is true, can I can work out why it could help explain\nwhy there are so many different warning patterns in any not place. Then we might finally\nunderstand how they could evolve in such a complex way.” The job was complicated by the\nsheer diversity of species involved at Jatun Sach. Not only were there 56 ithomiine butterfly\nspecies divided among eight mimicry rings, but there were also 69 other insect species,\nincluding 34 day-flying moths and a damselfly, all in a 200-hectare study area. Like many\nentomologists before him, Beccaloni used a large bag-like net to capture his prey. This\nallowed him to sample the 2.5 metres immediately above the forest floor. Unlike many\nprevious workers, he kept very precise notes on exactly where he caught his specimens.\nG\nThe attention to detail paid off. Beccaloni found that the mimicry rings were flying at two\nquite separate altitudes. “Their use of the forest was quite distinctive,” he recalls. “For\nexample, most members of the clear-winged mimicry ring would fly close to the forest floor,\nwhile the majority of the 12 species in the tiger-winged ring fly high up.” Each mimicry wing\nhad its own characteristic flight height.\nH\nHowever, this being practice rather than theory, things were a bit fuzzy. “They’d spend the\nmajority of their time flying at a certain height. But they’d also spend a smaller proportion of\ntheir time flying at other heights,” Beccaloni admits. Species weren’t stacked rigidly like\npassenger jets waiting to land, but they did appear to have preferred airspace in the forest.\nSo far, so good, but he still hadn’t explained what causes the various groups of ithomiines\nand their chromatic consorts to fly in formations at these particular heights.\nI\nThen Beccaloni had a bright idea. “I started looking at the distribution of ithomiine larval\nfood plants within the canopy,” he says. “For each one, I’d record the height to which the\nhost plant grew and the height above the ground at which the eggs or larvae were found.\nOnce I got them back to the field station’s lab, it was just a matter of keeping them alive\n \n2\n\nuntil they pupated and then hatched into adults which I could identify.”\n \n3",
