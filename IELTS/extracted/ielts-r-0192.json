  "passage_text": "Reading Practice\n \nGrey Workers\nA\nGiven the speed at which their workers are growing greyer, employers know surprisingly\nlittle about how productive they are. The general assumption is that the old are paid more\nin spite of, rather than because of, their extra productivity. That might partly explain why,\nwhen employers are under pressure to cut costs, they persuade the 55-year-olds to take\nearly retirement. Earlier this year, Sun Life of Canada, an insurance company, announced\nthat it was offering redundancy to all its British employees aged 50 or over “to bring in new\nblood”.\nB\nIn Japan, says Mariko Fujiwara, an industrial anthropologist who runs a think-tank for\nHakuhodo, Japan’s second-largest advertising agency, most companies are bringing down\nthe retirement age from the traditional 57 to 50 or thereabouts – and in some cases, such\nas Nissan, to 45. More than perhaps anywhere else, pay in Japan is linked to seniority.\nGiven that the percentage of workers who have spent more than 32 years with the same\nemployer rose from 11% in 1980 to 42% by 1994, it is hardly surprising that seniority-based\nwage costs have become the most intractable item on corporate profit-and-loss accounts.\nC\nIn Germany, Patrick Pohl, spokesman for Hoechst, expresses a widely held view: “The\ncompany is trying to lower the average age of the workforce. Perhaps the main reason for\nreplacing older workers is that it makes it easier to ‘defrost’ the corporate culture. Older\nworkers are less willing to try a new way of thinking. Younger workers are cheaper and\nmore flexible.” Some German firms are hampered from getting rid of older workers as\nquickly as they would like. At SGL Carbon, a graphite producer, the average age of\nworkers has been going up not down. The reason, says the company’s Ivo Lingnau, is not\nthat SGL values older workers more. It is collective bargaining: the union agreement puts\nstrict limits on the proportion of workers that may retire early.\nD\nClearly, when older people do heavy physical work, their age may affect their productivity.\nBut other skills may increase with age, including many that are crucial for good\nmanagement, such as an ability to handle people diplomatically, to run a meeting or to spot\na problem before it blows up. Peter Hicks, who co-ordinates OECD work on the policy\nimplications of ageing, says that plenty of research suggests older people are paid more\nbecause they are worth more.\nE\nAnd the virtues of the young may be exaggerated. “The few companies that have kept on\nolder workers find they have good judgment and their productivity is good,” says Mr\nPeterson. “Besides, their education standards are much better than those of today’s young\nhigh-school graduates.” Companies may say that older workers are not worth training,\nbecause they are reaching the end of their working lives: in fact, young people tend to\nswitch jobs so frequently that offer the worst returns on training. “The median age for\n \n1\n\nemployer-driven training is the late 40s and early 50s,” says Mr Hicks. “It goes mainly to\nmanagers.”\nF\nTake away those seniority-based pay scales, and older workers may become a much more\nattractive employment proposition. But most companies (and many workers) are\nuncomfortable with the idea of reducing someone’s pay in later life – although workers on\npiece-fates often earn less over time. So retaining the services of older workers may mean\nemploying them in new ways.\nG\nOne innovation, described in Mr Walker’s report on combating age barriers, was devised by\nIBM Belgium. Faced with the need to cut staff costs, and have decided to concentrate cuts\non 55-60-year-olds, IBM set up a separate company called SkillTeam, which re-employed\nany of the early retired who wanted to go on working up to the age of 60. An employee who\njoined SkillTeam at the age of 55 on a five-year contract would work for 58% of his time,\nover the full period, for 88% of his last IBM salary. The company offered services to IBM,\nthus allowing it to retain access to some of the intellectual capital it would otherwise have\nlost.\nH\nThe best way to tempt the old to go on working may be to build on such “bridge” jobs: part-\ntime or temporary employment that creates a more gradual transition from full-time work to\nretirement. Mr Quinn, who has studied the phenomenon, finds that, in the United States,\nnearly half of all men and women who had been in full-time jobs in middle age moved into\nsuch “bridge” jobs at the end of their working lives. In general, it is the best-paid and worst-\npaid who carry on working: “There are”, he says, “two very different types of bridge jog-\nholders – those who continue working because they have to and those who continue\nworking because they want to, even though they could afford to retire.”\nI\nIf the job market grows more flexible, the old may find more jobs that suit them. Often, they\nwill be self-employed. Sometimes, they may start their own businesses: a study by David\nStorey of Warwick University found that, in Britain, 70% of businesses started by people\nover 55 survived, compared with an average of only 19%. To coax the old back into the job\nmarket, work will not only have to pay. It will need to be more fun than touring the country\nin an Airstream trailer, or seeing the grandchildren, or playing golf. Only then will there be\nmany more Joe Clarks.\n \n2",
