  "passage_text": "Reading Practice\n \nThe origin of ancient writing\nA. The Sumerians, an ancient people of the Middle East, had a story explaining the\ninvention of writing more than 5,000 years ago. It seems a messenger of the King of\nUruk arrived at the court of a distant ruler so exhausted that he was unable to deliver\nthe oracle message. So the king set down the words of his next messages on a clay\ntablet. A charming story, whose retelling at a recent symposium at the University of\nPennsylvania amused scholar. They smiled at the absurdity of a letter which the\nrecipient would not have been able to read.\nB. They also doubted that the earliest writing was a direct rendering of speech. Writing\nmore likely began as a separate, symbolic system of communication and only later\nmerged with spoken language.\nC. Yet in the story the Sumerians, who lived in Mesopotamia, in what is now southern\nIraq, seemed to understand writing's transforming function. As Dr. Holly Pittman,\ndirector of the University's Center for Ancient Studies, observed, writing 'arose out of\nthe need to store and transmit information ...over time and space'.\nD. In exchanging interpretations and information, the scholars acknowledged that they\nstill had no fully satisfying answers to the questions of how and why writing\ndeveloped. Many favored an explanation of writing's origins in the visual arts, pictures\nbecoming increasingly abstract and eventually representing spoken words. Their\nviews clashed with a widely held theory among archaeologists that writing developed\nfrom the pieces of clay that Sumerian accountants used as tokens to keep track of\ngoods.\nE. Archaeologists generally concede that they have no definitive answer to the question\nof whether writing was invented only once, or arose independently in several places,\nsuch as Egypt, the Indus Valley, China, Mexico and Central America. The\npreponderance of archaeological data shows that the urbanizing Sumerians were the\nfirst to develop writing, in 3,200 or 3,300 BC. These are the dates for many clay\ntablets in an early form of cuneiform, a script written by pressing the end of a\nsharpened stick into wet clay, found at the site of the ancient city of Uruk. The baked\nclay tablets bore such images as pictorial symbols of the names of people, places\nand things connected with government and commerce. The Sumerian script gradually\nevolved from the pictorial to the abstract, but did not at first represent recorded\nspoken language.\nF.\nHistory of Science in Berlin, said, 'It is likely that there were mutual influences of\nwriting systems around the world. However, their great variety now shows that the\ndevelopment of writing, once initiated, attains a considerable degree of independence\nand flexibility to adapt to specific characteristics of the sounds of the language to be\nrepresented. Not that he accepts the conventional view that writing started as a\nrepresentation of words by pictures. New studies of early Sumerian writing, he said,\nchallenge this interpretation. The structures of this earliest writing did not, for\nexample, match the structure of spoken language, dealing mainly in lists and\nPeter Damerow, a specialist in Sumerian cuneiform at the Max Planck Institute for the\n \n1\n\ncategories rather than in sentences and narrative.\nG. For at least two decades, Dr. Denise Schmandt-Besserat, a University of Texas\narchaeologist, has argued that the first writing grew directly out of a system practised\nby Sumerian accountants. They used clay tokens, each one shaped to represent a\njar of oil, a container of grain or a particular kind of livestock. These tokens were\nsealed inside clay spheres, and then the number and type of tokens inside was\nrecorded on the outside using impressions resembling the tokens. Eventually, the\ntoken impressions were replaced with inscribed signs, and writing had been invented.\nH. Though Dr. Schmandt-Besserat has won much support, some linguists question her\nthesis, and others, like Dr. Pittman, think it too narrow. They emphasize that pictorial\nrepresentation and writing evolved together. 'There's no question that the token\nsystem is a forerunner of writing', Dr. Pittman said, 'but I have an argument with her\nevidence for a link between tokens and signs, and she doesn't open up the process\nto include picture making.\nI. Schmandt-Besserat vigorously defended her ideas. 'My colleagues say that pictures\nwere the beginning of writing' she said, 'but show me a single picture that becomes a\nsign in writing. They say that designs on pottery were the beginning of writing, but\nshow me a single sign of writing you can trace back to a pot - it doesn't exist'. In its\nfirst 500 years, she asserted, cuneiform writing was used almost solely for recording\neconomic information, and after that its uses multiplied and broadened.\nJ.\nNear East Civilizations at the University of Michigan, said that the proto- writing of\nSumerian Uruk was 'so radically different as to be a complete break with the past'. It\nno doubt served, he said, to store and communicate information, but also became a\nnew instrument of power. Some scholars noted that the origins of writing may not\nalways have been in economics. In Egypt, most early writing is high on monuments or\ndeep in tombs. In this case, said Dr. Pascal Vernus from a university in Paris, early\nwriting was less administrative than sacred. It seems that the only certainty in this field\nis that many questions remain to be answered.\nYet other scholars have advanced different ideas. Dr. Piotr Michalowski, Professor of\n \n2",
