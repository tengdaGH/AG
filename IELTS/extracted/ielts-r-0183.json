Such is our dependence on fossil fuels, and such the volume of carbon dioxide we have\nalready released into the atmosphere, that most climate scientists agree that significant\nglobal warming is now inevitable – the best we can hope to do is keep it at a reasonable\nlevel, and even that going to be an uphill task.\n \nAt present, the only serious option on the table for doing this is cutting back on our carbon\nemissions, but a few countries are making major strides in this regard, the majority are\nhaving great difficulty even stemming the rate of increase, let alone reversing\nConsequently, an increasing number of scientists are beginning to explore the alternatives.\nThey under the banner of geoengineering generally defined as the intentional large-scale\nmanipulation of the environment.\nB. Geoengineering has been shown to work, at least on a small, localised scale, for\ndecades. May Day parades in Moscow have taken place under clear blue skies, aircraft\nhaving deposited dry ice, silver iodide (m $1) and cement powder to disperse clouds. Many\nof the schemes now suggested look to do the opposite, and reduce the amount of sunlight\nreaching the planet.\nOne scheme focuses on achieving a general cooling of the Earth and involves the concept\nof releasing aerosol sprays into the stratosphere above the Arctic to create clouds of\nsulphur dioxide, which would, in turn, lead to a global dimming. The idea is modelled on\nhistorical volcanic explosions, such as that of Mount Pinatubo in the Philippines in 1991;\nwhich led to a short-term cooling of global temperatures by 0.5°c. The aerosols could be\ndelivered by artillery, high-flying aircraft or balloons.\nC. Instead of concentrating on global cooling, other schemes look specifically at reversing\nthe melting at the poles. One idea is to bolster an ice cap by spraying it with water. Using\npumps to carry water from below the sea ice the spray would come out as snow or ice\nparticles, producing thicker sea ice with a higher albedo (the ratio of sunlight reflected from\na surface) to reflect summer radiation. Scientists have also scrutinised whether it is\npossible to block iceflow in Greenland with cables which have been reinforced, preventing\nicebergs from moving into the sea.\n \nVeil Albert Kallio, a Finnish scientist, says that such an idea is impractical, because the\nforce of the ice would ultimately snap the cables and rapidly release a large quantity of\nfrozen ice into the sea. However, Kallio believes that the sort of cables used in suspension\nbridges could potentially be used to divert, rather than halt, the southward movement of ice\nfrom Spitsbergen. It would stop the ice moving south, and local currents would see them\nfloat northwards’ he says.\nD. A number of geoengineering ideas are currently being examined in the Russian Arctic.\nThese include planting millions of birch trees: the thinking, according to Kallio, is that their\nwhite bark would increase the amount of reflected sunlight. The loss of their leaves in\n \n1\n\nwinter would also enable the snow to reflect radiation. In contrast, the native evergreen\npines tend to shade the snow and absorb radiation.\nUsing ice-breaking vessels to deliberately break up and scatter coastal sea ice in both\nArctic and Antarctic waters in their respective autumns, and diverting Russian rivers to\nincrease cold-water flow to ice-forming areas, could also be used to slow down warming,\nKallio says. 1 You would need the wind to blow the right way, but in the right conditions, by\nletting ice float free and head north, you would enhance ice growth.’\nE. But will such ideas ever be implemented? The major counter-arguments to\ngeoengineering schemes are, first, that they are a ‘cop-out’ that allow US to continue living\nthe way we do, rather than reducing carbon emissions; and, second, even if they do work,\nwould the side-effects outweigh the advantages? Then there’s the daunting prospect of\nupkeep and repair of any scheme as well as the consequences of a technical failure. ‘I\nthink all of US agree that if we were to end geoengineering on a given day, then the planet\nwould return to its pre-engineered condition very rapidly, and probably within 10 to 20\nyears’ says Dr Phil Rasch, chief scientist for climate change at the US-based Pacific\nNorthwest National Laboratory.\n \nThat’s certainly something to worry about. I would consider geoengineering as a strategy to\nemploy only we manage the conversion to a non-fossil- fuel economy. ‘The risk with\ngeoengineering projects is that you can “overshoot”,’ says Dr Dan hunt, from the University\nof Bristol. ‘You may bring global temperatures back to pre-industrial levels, but the risk is\nthat the poles will still be warmer than they should be and the tropics be cooler than before\nindustrialization.’\nF. The main reason why geoengineering is countenanced by the mainstream scientific\ncommunity is that most researchers have little faith in the of politicians to agree – and then\nbring in the necessary carbon cuts. Even leading conservation organisations believe the\nsubject worth exploring. As Dr Martin Sommerkorn, a climate change advisor says.’\nBut human-induced climate change has brought humanity to a position where it important\nnot to exclude thinking thoroughly about this topic and its possibilities despite the potential\ndrawbacks. If, over the coming years, the science US about an ever-increased climate\nsensitivity of the planet and this isn’t unrealistic – then we may be best served by not\nhaving to start our thinking from scratch.\n \n2",
