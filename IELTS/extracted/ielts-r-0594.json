  "passage_text": "Reading Practice\n \nTV Addiction 1\n \nA\nThe amount of time people spend watching television is astonishing. On average,\nindividuals in the industrialized world devote three hours a day to the pursuit – fully half of\ntheir leisure time, and more than on any single activity save work and sleep. At this rate,\nsomeone who lives to 75 would spend nine years in front of the tube. To some\ncommentators, this devotion means simply that people enjoy TV and make a conscious\ndecision to watch it. But if that is the whole story, why do so many people experience\nmisgivings about how much they view? In Gallup polls in 1992 and 1999, two out of five\nadult respondents and seven out of 10 teenagers said they spent too much time watching\nTV. Other surveys have consistently shown that roughly 10 percent of adults calls\nthemselves TV addicts.\nB\nTo study people’s reactions to TV, researches have undertaken laboratory experiments in\nwhich they have monitored the brain waves (using an electroencephalograph, or EEG) to\ntrack behavior and emotion in the normal course of life, as opposed to the artificial\nconditions of the lab. Participants carried a beeper, and we signaled them six to eight times\na day, at random, over the period of a week; whenever they heard the beep, they wrote\ndown what they were doing and how they were feeling using a standardized scorecard.\nC\nAs one might expect, people who were watching TV when we beeped them\nreported feeling relaxed and passive. The EEG studies similarly show less mental\nstimulation, as measured by alpha brain-wave production, during viewing than during\nreading. What is more surprising is that the sense of relaxation ends when the set is turned\noff, but the feelings of passivity and lowered alertness continue. Survey participants say\nthey have more difficulty concentrating after viewing than before. In contrast, they rarely\nindicate such difficulty after reading. After playing sports or engaging in hobbies, people\nreport improvements in mood. After watching TV, people’s moods are about the same or\nworse than before. That may be because of viewers’ vague learned sense that they will feel\nless relaxed if they stop viewing. So they tend not to turn the set-off. Viewing begets more\nviewing which is the same as the experience of habit-forming drugs. Thus, the irony of TV:\npeople watch a great deal longer than they plan to, even though prolonged viewing is less\nrewarding. In our ESM studies the longer people sat in front of the set, the less satisfaction\nthey said they derived from it. For some, a twinge of unease or guilt that they aren’t doing\nsomething more productive may also accompany and depreciate the enjoyment of\nprolonged viewing. Researchers in Japan, the U.K. and the U.S. have found that this guilt\noccurs much more among middle-class viewers than among less affluent ones.\nD\nWhat is it about TV that has such a hold on us? In part, the attraction seems to spring from\nour biological ‘orienting response.’ First described by Ivan Pavlov in 1927, the orienting\nresponse is our instinctive visual or auditory reaction to any sudden or novel stimulus. It is\n \n1\n\npart of our evolutionary heritage, a built-in sensitivity to movement and potential predatory\nthreats. In 1986 Byron Reeves of Stanford University, Esther Thorson of the University of\nMissouri and their colleagues began to study whether the simple formal features of\ntelevision – cuts, edits, zooms, pans, sudden noises – activate the orienting response,\nthereby keeping attention on the screen. By watching how brain waves were affected by\nformal features, the researchers concluded that these stylistic tricks can indeed trigger\ninvoluntary responses and ‘derive their attentional value through the evolutionary\nsignificance of detecting movement… It is the form, not the content, of television that is\nunique.’\nE\nThe natural attraction to television’s sound and the light starts very early in life. Dafna\nLemish of Tel Aviv University has described babies at six to eight weeks attending to\ntelevision. We have observed slightly older infants who, when lying on their backs on the\nfloor, crane their necks around 180 degrees to catch what light through yonder window\nbreaks. This inclination suggests how deeply rooted the orienting response is.\nF\nThe Experience Sampling Method permitted us to look closely at most every domain of\neveryday life: working, eating, reading, talking to friends, playing a sport, and so on. We\nfound that heavy viewers report feeling significantly more anxious and less happy than light\nviewers do in unstructured situations, such as doing nothing, daydreaming or waiting in\nline. The difference widens when the viewer is alone. Subsequently, Robert D. McIlwraith\nof the University of Manitoba extensively studies those who called themselves TV addicts\non surveys. On a measure called the Short Imaginal Processes Inventory (SIPI), he found\nthat the self-described addicts are more easily bored and distracted and have poorer\nattentional control than the non-addicts. The addicts said they used TV to distract\nthemselves from unpleasant thoughts and to fill time. Other studies over the years have\nshown that heavy viewers are less likely to participate in community activities and sports\nand are more likely to be obese than moderate viewers or non-viewers.\nG\nMore than 25 years ago psychologist Tannis M. MacBeth Williams of the University of\nBritish Columbia studied a mountain community that had no television until cable finally\narrived. Over time, both adults and children in the town became less creative in problem-\nsolving, less able to persevere at tasks, and less tolerant of unstructured time.\nH\nNearly 40 years ago Gary A. Steiner of the University of Chicago collected fascinating\nindividual accounts of families whose set had broken. In experiments, families have\nvolunteered or been paid to stop viewing, typically for a week or a month. Some fought,\nverbally and physically. In a review of these could-turkey studies, Charles Winick of the City\nUniversity of New York concluded: ‘The first three or four days for most persons were the\nworst, even in many homes where the viewing was minimal and where there were other\nongoing activities. In over half of all the households, during these first few days of loss, the\nregular routines were disrupted, family members had difficulties in dealing with the newly\navailable time, anxiety and aggressions were expressed…. By the second week, a move\ntoward adaptation to the situation was common.’ Unfortunately, researchers have yet to\n \n2\n\nflesh out these anecdotes; no one has systematically gathered statistics on the prevalence\nof these withdrawal symptoms.\nI\nEven though TV does seem to meet the criteria for substance dependence, not all\nresearchers would go so far as to call TV addictive. McIlwraith said in 1988 that\n‘displacement of other activities by television may be socially significant but still fall short of\nthe clinical requirement of significant impairment.’ He argued that a new category of ‘TV\naddiction’ may not be necessary if heavy viewing stems from conditions such as\ndepression and social phobia. Nevertheless, whether or not we formally diagnose someone\nas TV-dependent, millions of people sense that they cannot readily control the amount of\ntelevision they watch.\n \n3",
