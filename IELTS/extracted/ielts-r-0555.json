  "passage_text": "Reading Practice\n \nThe sense of flavour 2\n{A} Scientists now believe that human beings acquired the sense of taste as a way to avoid\nbeing poisoned. Edible plants generally taste sweet; deadly ones, bitter. Taste is supposed\nto help us differentiate food that’s good for us from food that’s not. The taste buds on our\ntongues can detect the presence of half a dozen or so basic tastes, including sweet, sour,\nbitter, salty, and umami (a taste discovered by Japanese researchers, a rich and full sense\nof deliciousness triggered by amino acids in foods such as shellfish, mushrooms, potatoes,\nand seaweed). Tastebuds offers a limited means of detection, however, compared with the\nhuman olfactory system, which can perceive thousands of different chemical aromas.\nIndeed, ‘flavor’ is primarily the smell of gases being released by the chemicals you’ve just\nput in your mouth. The aroma of food can be responsible for as much as 90% of its flavor.\n \n{B} The act of drinking, sucking or chewing a substance releases its volatile gases. They\nflow out of the mouth and up the nostrils, or up the passageway at the back of the mouth,\nto a thin layer of nerve cells called the olfactory epithelium, located at the base of the nose,\nright between the eyes. The brain combines the complex smell signals from the epithelium\nwith the simple taste signals from the tongue, assigns a flavor to what’s in your mouth, and\ndecides if it’s something you want to eat.\n{C} Babies like sweet tastes and reject bitter ones; we know this because scientists have\nrubbed various flavors inside the mouths of infants and then recorded their facial reactions.\nA person’s food preferences, like his or her personality, are formed during the first few\nyears of life, through a process of socialization. Toddlers can learn to enjoy hot and spicy\nfood, bland health food, or fast food, depending upon what the people around them eat.\nThe human sense of smell is still not fully understood. It is greatly affected by psychological\nfactors and expectations. The mind filters out the overwhelming majority of chemical\naromas that surround us, focusing intently on some, ignoring others. People can grow\naccustomed to bad smells or good smells; they stop noticing what once seemed\noverpowering.\n{D} Aroma and memory are somehow inextricably linked. A smell can suddenly evoke a\nlong-forgotten moment. The flavours of childhood foods seem to leave an indelible mark,\nand adults often return to them, without always knowing why. These ‘comfort foods’\nbecome a source of pleasure and reassurance a fact that fast-food chains work hard to\npromote Childhood memories of Happy Meals can translate into frequent adult visits to\nMcDonald’s’, like those of the chain’s ‘heavy users’, the customers who eat there four or\nfive times a week.\n{E} The human craving for flavour has been a large unacknowledged and unexamined\nforce in history. Royal empires have been built, unexplored lands have been traversed,\ngreat religions and philosophies have been forever changed by the spice trade. In 1492,\nChristopher Columbus set sail in order to try to find new seasonings and thus to make his\nfortune with this most desired commodity of that time. Today, the influence of flavour in the\nworld marketplace is no less decisive. The rise and fall of corporate empires – soft-drink\ncompanies, snack-food companies, and fast-food chains – is frequently determined by how\ntheir products taste.\n \n1\n\n \n \n{F} The flavor industry emerged in the mid-1800s, as processed foods began to be\nmanufactured on a large scale. Recognizing the need for flavor additives, the early food\nprocessors turned to perfume companies that had years of experience working with\nessential oils and volatile aromas. The great perfume houses of England, France, and the\nNetherlands produced many of the first flavor compounds. In the early part of the 20th\ncentury, Germany’s powerful chemical industry assumed the lead in flavour production.\nLegend has it that a German scientist discovered methyl anthranilate, one of the first\nartificial flavours, by accident while mixing chemicals in his laboratory. Suddenly, the lab\nwas filled with the sweet smell of grapes. Methyl anthranilate later became the chief\nflavoring compound of manufactured grape juice.\n{G} The quality that people seek most of all in a food, its flavour, is usually present in a\nquantity too infinitesimal to be measured by any traditional culinary terms such as ounces\nor teaspoons. Today’s sophisticated spectrometers, gas chromatograph, and headspace\nvapor analyzers provide a detailed map of a food’s flavour components, detecting chemical\naromas in amounts as low as one part per billion. The human nose, however, is still more\nsensitive than any machine yet invented. A nose can detect aromas present in quantities of\na few parts per trillion. Complex aromas, such as those of coffee or roasted meat, may be\ncomposed of gases from nearly a thousand different chemicals. The chemical that provides\nthe dominant flavour of bell pepper can be tasted in amounts as low as 0.02 parts per\nbillion; one drop is sufficient to add flavour to the amount of water needed to fill five\naverage-sized swimming pools\n \n2",
