  "passage_text": "Reading Practice\n \nThe dugong: sea cow\n \n \nDugongs are herbivorous mammals that spend their entire lives in the sea. Their close\nrelatives the manatees also venture into or live in freshwater. Together dugongs and\nmanatees make up the order Sirenia or sea cows, so-named because dugongs and\nmanatees are thought to have given rise to the myth of the mermaids or sirens of the sea.\nA\nThe dugong, which is a large marine mammal which, together with the manatees, looks\nrather like a cross between a rotund dolphin and a walrus. Its body, flippers and fluke\nresemble those of a dolphin but it has no dorsal fin. Its head looks somewhat like that of a\nwalrus without the long tusks.\nB\nDugongs, along with other Sirenians whose diet consists mainly of sea-grass; and the\ndistribution of dugongs very closely follows that of these marine flowering plants. As\nseagrasses grow rooted in the sediment, they are limited by the availability of light.\nConsequently they are found predominantly in shallow coastal waters, and so too are\ndugongs. But, this is not the whole story. Dugongs do not eat all species of seagrass,\npreferring seagrass of higher nitrogen and lower fibre content.\nC\nDue to their poor eyesight, dugongs often use smell to locate edible plants. They also have\na strong tactile sense, and feel their surroundings with their long sensitive bristles. They will\ndig up an entire plant and then shake it to remove the sand before eating it. They have\nbeen known to collect a pile of plants in one area before eating them. The flexible and\nmuscular upper lip is used to dig out the plants. When eating they ingest the whole plant,\nincluding the roots, although when this is impossible they will feed on just the leaves. A\nwide variety of seagrass has been found in dugong stomach contents, and evidence exists\nthey will eat algae when seagrass is scarce. Although almost completely herbivorous, they\nwill occasionally eat invertebrates such as jellyfish, sea squirts, and shellfish.\nD\nA heavily grazed seagrass bed looks like a lawn mown by a drunk. Dugongs graze\napparently at random within a seagrass bed, their trails meandering in all directions across\nthe bottom. This is rather an inefficient means of removing seagrass that results in\nnumerous small tufts remaining. And this is where the dugongs derive some advantage\nfrom their inefficiency. The species that recover most quickly from this disturbance,\nspreading out vegetatively from the remaining tufts, are those that dugongs like to eat. In\naddition, the new growth found in these areas tends to be exactly what hungry dugongs\nlike.\nE\nDugongs are semi-nomadic, often travelling long distances in search of food, but staying\n \n1\n\nwithin a certain range their entire life. Large numbers often move together from one area to\nanother. It is thought that these movements are caused by changes in seagrass availability.\nTheir memory allows them to return to specific points after long travels. Dugong\nmovements mostly occur within a localised area of seagrass beds, and animals in the\nsame region show individualistic patterns of movement.\nF\nRecorded numbers of dugongs are generally believed to be lower than actual numbers,\ndue to a lack of accurate surveys. Despite this, the dugong population is thought to be\nshrinking, with a worldwide decline of 20 per cent in the last 90 years. They have\ndisappeared from the waters of Hong Kong, Mauritius, and Taiwan, as well as parts of\nCambodia, Japan, the Philippines and Vietnam. Further disappearances are likely. (In the\nlate 1960s, herds of up to 500 dugongs were observed off the coast of East Africa and\nnearby islands. However, current populations in this area are extremely small, numbering\n50 and below, and it is thought likely they will become extinct. The eastern side of the Red\nSea is the home of large populations numbering in the hundreds, and similar populations\nare thought to exist on the western side. In the 1980s, it was estimated there could be as\nmany as 4,000 dugongs in the Red Sea. The Persian Gulf has the second-largest dugong\npopulation in the world, inhabiting most of the southern coast, and the current population is\nbelieved to be around 7,500. Australia is home to the largest population, stretching from\nShark Bay in Western Australia to Moreton Bay in Queensland. The population of Shark\nBay is thought to be stable with over 10,000 dugongs.)\nG\nExperience from various parts of northern Australia suggests that Extreme weather such as\ncyclones and floods can destroy hundreds of square kilometres of seagrass meadows, as\nwell as washing dugongs ashore. The recovery of seagrass meadows and the spread of\nseagrass into new areas, or areas where it has been destroyed, can take over a decade.\nFor example, about 900 km2 of seagrass was lost in Hervey Bay in 1992, probably\nbecause of murky water from flooding of local rivers, and run-off turbulence from a cyclone\nthree weeks later. Such events can cause extensive damage to seagrass communities\nthrough severe wave action, shifting sand and reduction in saltiness and light levels. Prior\nto the 1992 floods, the extensive seagrasses in Hervey Bay supported an estimated 1750\ndugongs. Eight months after the floods the affected area was estimated to support only\nabout 70 dugongs. Most animals presumably survived by moving to neighbouring areas.\nHowever, many died attempting to move to greener pastures, with emaciated carcasses\nwashing up on beaches up to 900km away.\nH\nIf dugongs do not get enough to eat they may calve later and produce fewer young. Food\nshortages can be caused by many factors, such as a loss of habitat, death and decline in\nquality of seagrass, and a disturbance of feeding caused by human activity. Sewage,\ndetergents, heavy metal, hypersaline water, herbicides, and other waste products all\nnegatively affect seagrass meadows. Human activity such as mining, trawling, dredging,\nland-reclamation, and boat propeller scarring also cause an increase in sedimentation\nwhich smothers seagrass and prevents light from reaching it. This is the most significant\nnegative factor affecting seagrass. One of the dugong’s preferred species of seagrass,\nHalophila ovalis, declines rapidly due to lack of light, dying completely after 30 days.\n \n2\n\nI\nDespite being legally protected in many countries, the main causes of population decline\nremain anthropogenic and include hunting, habitat degradation, and fishing-related\nfatalities. Entanglement in fishing nets has caused many deaths, although there are no\nprecise statistics. Most issues with industrial fishing occur in deeper waters where dugong\npopulations are low, with local fishing being the main risk in shallower waters. As dugongs\ncannot stay As dugongs cannot stay underwater for a very long period, they are highly\nprone to deaths due to entanglement. The use of shark nets has historically caused large\nnumbers of deaths, and they have been eliminated in most areas and replaced with baited\nhooks. Hunting has historically been a problem too, although in most areas they are no\nlonger hunted, with the exception of certain indigenous communities. In areas such as\nnorthern Australia, hunting remains the greatest impact on the dugong population\n \n3",
