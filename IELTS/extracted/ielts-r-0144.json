  "passage_text": "Reading Practice\n \nEducating Psyche\nEducating Psyche by Bernie Neville is a book which looks at radical new approaches to\nlearning, describing the effects of emotion, imagination and the unconscious on\nlearning. One theory discussed in the book is that proposed by George Lozanov, which\nfocuses on the power of suggestion.\nLozanov's instructional technique is based on the evidence that the connections made in\nthe brain through unconscious processing (which he calls non-specific mental\nreactivity) are more durable than those made through conscious processing. Besides the\nlaboratory evidence for this, we know from our experience that we often remember what we\nhave perceived peripherally, long after we have forgotten what we set out to learn. If we\nthink of a book we studied months or years ago, we will find it easier to recall\nperipheral details - the colour, the binding, the typeface, the table at the library where we\nsat while studying it - than the content on which we were concentrating. If we think of a\nlecture we listened to with great concentration, we will recall the lecturer's appearance\nand mannerisms, our place in the auditorium, the failure of the air-conditioning, much\nmore easily than the ideas we went to learn. Even if these peripheral details are a bit\nelusive, they come back readily in hypnosis or when we relive the event imaginatively, as\nin psychodrama. The details of the content of the lecture, on the other hand, seem to\nhave gone forever. \nThis phenomenon can be partly attributed to the common counterproductive approach to\nstudy (making extreme efforts to memorise, tensing muscles, inducing fatigue), but it\nalso simply reflects the way the brain functions. Lozanov therefore made indirect\ninstruction (suggestion) central to his teaching system. In suggestopedia, as he called his\nmethod, consciousness is shifted away from the curriculum to focus on something\nperipheral. The curriculum then becomes peripheral and is dealt with by the reserve\ncapacity of the brain.\nThe suggestopedic approach to foreign language learning provides a good illustration. In its\nmost recent variant (1980), it consists of the reading of vocabulary and text while the class\nis listening to music. The first session is in two parts. In the first part, the music is classical\n(Mozart, Beethoven, Brahms) and the teacher reads the text slowly and solemnly, with\nattention to the dynamics of the music. The students follow the text in their books. This is\nfollowed by several minutes of silence. In the second part, they listen to baroque music\n(Bach, Corelli, Handel) while the teacher reads the text in a normal speaking voice. During\nthis time they have their books closed. During the whole of this session, their attention is\npassive; they listen to the music but make no attempt to learn the material.\nBeforehand, the students have been carefully prepared for the language learning\nexperience. Through meeting with the staff and satisfied students they develop\nthe expectation that learning will be easy and pleasant and that they will successfully learn\nseveral hundred words of the foreign language during the class. In a preliminary talk, the\nteacher introduces them to the material to be covered, but does not 'teach' it. Likewise, the\nstudents are instructed not to try to learn it during this introduction.\nSome hours after the two-part session, there is a follow-up class at which the students are\nstimulated to recall the material presented. Once again the approach is indirect.\nThe students do not focus their attention on trying to remember the vocabulary, but focus\n \n1\n\non using the language to communicate (e.g. through games or improvised\ndramatisations). Such methods are not unusual in language teaching. What is distinctive in\nthe suggestopedic method is that they are devoted entirely to assisting recall. The\n'learning' of the material is assumed to be automatic and effortless, accomplished while\nlistening to music. The teacher's task is to assist the students to apply what they have\nlearned paraconsciously, and in doing so to make it easily accessible to consciousness.\nAnother difference from conventional teaching is the evidence that students can regularly\nlearn 1000 new words of a foreign language during a suggestopedic session, as well\nas grammar and idiom.\nLozanov experimented with teaching by direct suggestion during sleep, hypnosis and\ntrance states, but found such procedures unnecessary. Hypnosis, yoga, Silva mind-\ncontrol, religious ceremonies and faith healing are all associated with successful\nsuggestion, but none of their techniques seem to be essential to it. Such rituals may be\nseen as placebos. Lozanov acknowledges that the ritual surrounding suggestion in his own\nsystem is also a placebo, but maintains that without such a placebo people are unable or\nafraid to tap the reserve capacity of their brains. Like any placebo, it must be dispensed\nwith authority to be effective. Just as a doctor calls on the full power of autocratic\nsuggestion by insisting that the patient take precisely this white capsule precisely three\ntimes a day before meals, Lozanov is categoric in insisting that the suggestopedic session\nbe conducted exactly in the manner designated, by trained and accredited suggestopedic\nteachers.\nWhile suggestopedia has gained some notoriety through success in the teaching of modern\nlanguages, few teachers are able to emulate the spectacular results of Lozanov and his\nassociates. We can, perhaps, attribute mediocre results to an inadequate placebo effect.\nThe students have not developed the appropriate mind set. They are often not motivated to\nlearn through this method. They do not have enough 'faith'. They do not see it as 'real\nteaching', especially as it does not seem to involve the 'work' they have learned to believe\nis essential to learning.\n \n2",
