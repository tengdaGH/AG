  "passage_text": "Reading Practice\n \nKnowledge in medicine\nA\nWhat counts as knowledge? What do we mean when we say that we know something?\nWhat is the status of different kinds of knowledge? In order to explore these questions, we\nare going to focus on one particular area of knowledge – medicine.\nB\nHow do you know when you are ill? This may seem to be an absurd question. You know\nyou are ill because you feel ill; your body tells you that you are ill. You may know that you\nfeel pain or discomfort but knowing you are ill is a bit more complex. At times, people\nexperience the symptoms of illness, but in fact, they are simply tired or over-worked or they\nmay just have a hangover. At other times, people may be suffering from a disease and fail\nto be aware of the illness until it has reached a late stage in its development. So how do we\nknow we are ill, and what counts as knowledge?\nC\nThink about this example. You feel unwell. You have a bad cough and always seem to be\ntired. Perhaps it could be stress at work, or maybe you should give up smoking. You feel\nworse. You visit the doctor who listens to your chest and heart, takes your temperature and\nblood pressure, and then finally prescribes antibiotics for your cough.\nD\nThings do not improve but you struggle on thinking you should pull yourself together,\nperhaps things will ease off at work soon. A return visit to your doctor shocks you. This time\nthe doctor, drawing on years of training and experience, diagnoses pneumonia. This\nmeans that you will need bed rest and a considerable time off work. The scenario is\ntransformed. Although you still have the same symptoms, you no longer think that these\nare caused by pressure at work. You know have proof that you are ill. This is the result of\nthe combination of your own subjective experience and the diagnosis of someone who has\nthe status of a medical expert. You have a medically authenticated diagnosis and it\nappears that you are seriously ill; you know you are ill and have the evidence upon which\nto base this knowledge.\nE\nThis scenario shows many different sources of knowledge. For example, you decide to\nconsult the doctor in the first place because you feel unwell – this is personal knowledge\nabout your own body. However, the doctor’s expert diagnosis is based on experience and\ntraining, with sources of knowledge as diverse as other experts, laboratory reports, medical\ntextbooks and years of experience.\nF\nOne source of knowledge is the experience of our own bodies; the personal knowledge we\nhave of changes that might be significant, as well as the subjective experiences are\nmediated by other forms of knowledge such as the words we have available to describe our\n \n1\n\nexperience, and the common sense of our families and friends as well as that drawn from\npopular culture. Over the past decade, for example, Western culture has seen a significant\nemphasis on stress-related illness in the media. Reference to being ‘stressed out’ has\nbecome a common response in daily exchanges in the workplace and has become part of\npopular common-sense knowledge. It is thus not surprising that we might seek such an\nexplanation of physical symptoms of discomfort.\nG\nWe might also rely on the observations of others who know us. Comments from friends and\nfamily such as ‘you do look ill’ or ‘that’s a bad cough’ might be another source of\nknowledge. Complementary health practices, such as holistic medicine, produce their own\nsets of knowledge upon which we might also draw in deciding the nature and degree of our\nill health and about possible treatments.\nH\nPerhaps the most influential and authoritative source of knowledge is the medical\nknowledge provided by the general practitioner. We expect the doctor to have access to\nexpert knowledge. This is socially sanctioned. It would not be acceptable to notify our\nemployer that we simply felt too unwell to turn up for work or that our faith healer,\nastrologer, therapist or even our priest thought it was not a good idea. We need an expert\nmedical diagnosis in order to obtain the necessary certificate if we need to be off work for\nmore than the statutory self-certification period. The knowledge of the medical sciences is\nprivileged in this respect in contemporary Western culture. Medical practitioners are also\nseen as having the required expert knowledge that permits them legally to prescribe drugs\nand treatment to which patients would not otherwise have access. However, there is a\nrange of different knowledge upon which we draw when making decisions about our own\nstate of health.\nI\nHowever, there is more than existing knowledge in this little story; new knowledge is\nconstructed within it. Given the doctor’s medical training and background, she may\nhypothesize ‘is this now pneumonia?’ and then proceed to look for evidence about it. She\nwill use observations and instruments to assess the evidence and – critically – interpret it in\nlight of her training and experience. This results in new knowledge and new experience\nboth for you and for the doctor. This will then be added to the doctor’s medical knowledge\nand may help in the future diagnosis of pneumonia.\n \n2",
