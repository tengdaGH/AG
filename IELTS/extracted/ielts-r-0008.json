  "passage_text": "Reading Practice\n \nAdventures in mathematical reasoning\nA\nOccasionally, in some difficult musical compositions, there are beautiful, but easy parts -\nparts so simple a beginner could play them. So it is with mathematics as well. There are\nsome discoveries in advanced mathematics that do not depend on specialized knowledge,\nnot even on algebra, geometry, or trigonometry. Instead they may involve, at most, a little\narithmetic, such as ‘the sum of two odd numbers is even’, and common sense. Each of the\neight chapters in this book illustrates this phenomenon. Anyone can understand every step\nin the reasoning. The thinking in each chapter uses at most only elementary arithmetic, and\nsometimes not even that. Thus all readers will have the chance to participate in\na mathematical experience, to appreciate the beauty of mathematics, and to\nbecome familiar with its logical, yet intuitive, style of thinking.\nB\nOne of my purposes in writing this book is to give readers who haven’t had the opportunity\nto see and enjoy real mathematics the chance to appreciate the mathematical way of\nthinking. I want to reveal not only some of the fascinating discoveries, but, more\nimportantly, the reasoning behind them. In that respect, this book differs from most books\non mathematics written for the general public. Some present the lives of colorful\nmathematicians. Others describe important applications of mathematics. Yet others go into\nmathematical procedures, but assume that the reader is adept in using algebra.\nC\nI hope this book will help bridge that notorious gap that separates the two cultures: the\nhumanities and the sciences, or should I say the right brain (intuitive) and the left brain\n(analytical, numerical). As the chapters will illustrate, mathematics is not restricted to the\nanalytical and numerical; intuition plays a significant role. The alleged gap can be narrowed\nor completely overcome by anyone, in part because each of us is far from using the full\ncapacity of either side of the brain. To illustrate our human potential, I cite a structural\nengineer who is an artist, an electrical engineer who is an opera singer, an opera singer\nwho published mathematical research, and a mathematician who publishes short stories.\nD\nOther scientists have written books to explain their fields to non-scientists, but have\nnecessarily had to omit the mathematics, although it provides the foundation of\ntheir theories. The reader must remain a tantalized spectator rather than an\ninvolved participant, since the appropriate language for describing the details in much\nof science is mathematics, whether the subject is expanding universe, subatomic particles,\nor chromosomes. Though the broad.outline of a scientific theory can be sketched\nintuitively, when a part of the physical universe is finally understood, its description often\nlooks like a page in a mathematics text.\nE\nStill, the non-mathematical reader can go far in understanding mathematical reasoning.\nThis book presents the details that illustrate the mathematical style of thinking, which\n \n1\n\ninvolves sustained, step-by-step analysis, experiments, and insights. You will turn these\npages much more slowly than when reading a novel or a newspaper. It may help to have a\npencil and paper ready to check claims and carry out experiments.\nF\nAs I wrote, I kept in mind two types of readers: those who enjoyed mathematics until they\nwere turned off by an unpleasant episode, usually around fifth grade, and mathematics\naficionados, who will find much that is new throughout the book. This book also serves\nreaders who simply want to sharpen their analytical skills. Many careers, such as law and\nmedicine, require extended, precise analysis. Each chapter offers practice in following a\nsustained and closely argued line of thought. That mathematics can develop this skill is\nshown by these two testimonials:\nG\nA physician wrote, The discipline of analytical thought processes [in mathematics] prepared\nme extremely well for medical school. In medicine one is faced with a problem which must\nbe thoroughly analyzed before a solution can be found. The process is similar to doing\nmathematics.’\nA lawyer made the same point, “Although I had no background in law - not even one\npolitical science course — I did well at one of the best law schools. I attribute much of my\nsuccess there to having learned, through the study of mathematics, and, in particular,\ntheorems, how to analyze complicated principles. Lawyers who have studied mathematics\ncan master the legal principles in a way that most others cannot.’\nI hope you will share my delight in watching as simple, even naive, questions lead to\nremarkable solutions and purely theoretical discoveries find unanticipated applications.\n \n2",
