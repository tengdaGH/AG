The problem has even persuaded California, home of car\nculture, to curb traffic growth. But no matter how green they become, cars are unlikely\nto get us around crowded cities any faster. And persuading people to use trains and\nbuses will always be an uphill struggle. Cars, after all, are popular for very good\nreasons, as anyone with small children or heavy shopping knows.\nB.\nA professor of mechanical engineering sits typing at a computer keyboard, conjuring\nup a scene on his monitor that looks something like the classic computer game\nPacMan.White dots stream in from the right of the screen, switch to red, and merge\nwith green boxes, which swiftly change color to yellow and then red while moving\nthrough a bewildering maze. But this is not a video game.J.Edward Anderson of\nBoston University is testing an urban transit system that he believes could\nrevolutionize public transport worldwide.\nC.\nFor the past quarter of a century, Anderson has been promoting his version of\npersonal rapid transit(PRT). Other versions came and went in the 1970s, From\nEurope, Japan, and elsewhere in the Us, but he was so convinced of the idea’s\npotential that he stuck with it and, in 1983, founded the Taxi 2000 Corporation to\n‘commercialize the initiative. Although the University of Minnesota, Anderson’s\nemployer until 1986, holds the patents to the technology, he is licensed to develop it\nand to sub-license other developers. So politicians should be trying to lure people out\nof their cars, not forcing them out. There’s certainly no shortage of alternatives.\nPerhaps the most attractive is the concept known as personal rapid transit(PRT),\nindependently invented in the US and Europe in the 1950s.\nD.\nThe idea is to go to one of many stations and hop into a computer-controlled car that\ncan whisk you to your destination along with a network of guideways. You wouldn’t\nhave to share your space with strangers, and with no traffic lights, pedestrians, or\nparked cars to slow things down, PRT guideways can carry far more traffic, nonstop,\nthan any inner-city road. It’s a wonderful vision, but the odds are stacked against PRT\nfor a number of reasons. The first cars ran on existing roads, and it was only after\nthey became popular-and after governments started earning revenue from them- that\na road network designed specifically for motor vehicles was built. With PRT, the\nfracture would have to come first-and that would cost megabucks.\nE.\nWhat’s more, any transport system that threatened the car’s dominance would be up\nagainst all those with a stake in maintaining the status quo, from private car owners to\nmanufacturers and oil multinationals. Even if PRTs were spectacularly successful in\ntrials, it might not make much difference. Superior technology doesn’t always triumph,\nF.\nAccess http://mini-ielts.com for more practices\n1\n\nas the VHS versus Betamax and windows versus Apple Mac battles showed.\nG. But “dual-mode” systems might just succeed where PRT seems doomed to fail. The\nDanish RUF system envisaged by Palle Jensen, for example, resembles PRT but\nwith one key difference: vehicles have wheels as well as a slot allowing them to travel\non a monorail, so they can drive off the rail onto a normal road. Once on a road, the\noccupant would take over from the computer, and the Ruf vehicle-the term comes\nfrom a Danish saying meaning to “go fast”-would become an electric car.\nH. Build a fast network of guideways in a busy city center and people would have a\nstrong incentive not just to use public Ruf vehicles, but also to buy their own dual-\nmode vehicle. Commuters could drive onto the guideway, sit back, and read as they\nare chauffeured into the city. At work they would jump out, leaving their vehicles to\npark themselves. Unlike PRT, such a system could grow organically, as each network\nwould serve a large area around it and people nearby could buy into it. And a dual-\nmode system might even win the support of car manufacturers, who could easily\nswitch to producing dual-mode vehicles.\nI. The RUF system can reduce energy consumption from individual traffic. The main\nfactor is the reduction of air resistance due to the close coupling of vehicles. The\nenergy consumption per Ruf can is reduced to less than 1/3 at 100 km/h. Since RUF is\nan electric system, renewable sources can be used without problems. A combination\nof windmills and a RUF rail could be used over water. Solar cells can also be\nintegrated into the system and ensure completely sustainable transportation.\nJ. Of Course, creating a new transport system will not be cheap or easy. But unlike\nadding a dedicated bus lane here or extending the underground railway there, an\ninnovative system such as Jensen’s could transform cities. The vehicles in a RUF\nsystem rides” very safely on top of a triangular monorail. This means that derailments\nare impossible and that the users will feel safe because it is easy to understand that\nwhen the rail is actually inside the vehicle it is absolutely stable. The special rail brake\nensures that braking power is always available even during bad weather. The brake\ncan squeeze as hard against the rail as required in order to bring the vehicle to a safe\nstop. If a vehicle has to be evacuated, a walkway between the two rails can be used.\nK.\nmore than 30 million people have died in road accidents in the past century-three\ntimes the number killed in the First World War-and the annual death toll is rising. and\nwhat’s more the Red Cross believes road accidents will become the third biggest\ncause of death and disability by 2020, ahead of diseases such as AIDS and\ntuberculosis.
