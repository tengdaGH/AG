  "passage_text": "Reading Practice\n \nDesign the mat and Foot health\nA\nIndoor types will appreciate the cobblestone walkway, a knobbly textured plastic mat that\nthey can wobble along in the comfort of their own homes. And for the more adventurous,\nthere are shoes designed to throw you off balance.\nB\nThe technology may be cutting edge, but its origins are deep and exotic. Research into the\nidea that flat floors could be detrimental to our health was pioneered back in the late 1960s.\nWhile others in Long Beach, California, contemplated peace and love, podiatrist Charles\nBrantingham and physiologist Bruce Beekman were concerned with more pedestrian\nmatters. They reckoned that the growing epidemic of high blood pressure, varicose veins\nand deep-vein thromboses might be linked to the uniformity of the surfaces that we tend to\nstand and walk on.\nC\nThe trouble, as they saw it, was that walking continuously on flat floors, sidewalks and\nstreets concentrate forces on just a few areas of the foot. As a result, these surfaces are\nlikely to be far more conducive to chronic stress syndromes than natural ones, where the\nfoot meets the ground in a wide variety of orientations. The anatomy of the foot parallels\nthat of the human hand – each having 26 bones, 33 joints and more than 100 muscles,\ntendons and ligaments. Modem lifestyles waste all this flexibility in your socks.\nBrantingham and Beekman became convinced that damage was being done simply by\npeople standing on even surfaces and that this could be rectified by introducing a wobble.\nD\n“In Beijing and Shanghai city dwellers take daily walks on cobbled paths to improve their\nhealth.”  To test their ideas, they got 65 clerks and factory workers to try standing on a\nvariable terrain floor – spongy mats with amounts of giving across the surface. This modest\nirregularity allowed the soles of the volunteers’ feet to deviate slightly from the horizontal\neach time they shifted position. As the researchers hoped, this simple intervention turned\nout to make a huge difference over just a few weeks. Just a slight wobble from the floor\nactivated a host of muscles in people’s legs, which in turn helped to pump blood back to\ntheir hearts. The muscle action prevented the pooling of blood in their feet and legs,\nreducing the stress on the entire cardiovascular system. And two-thirds of the volunteers\nreported feeling much less tired.  Yet decades later, the flooring of the world’s workplaces\nremains relentlessly smooth.\nE\nEarlier this year, however, the idea was given a new lease of life when researchers in\nOregon announced findings from a similar experiment with people over 60. John Fisher\nand colleagues at the Oregon Research Institute in Eugene designed a mat intended to\nreplicate the effect of walking on cobblestones. In tests funded by the National Institute of\nAging, they got some 50 adults to walk on the mats in their stockinged feet for less than an\nhour three times a week. After 16 weeks, these people showed marked improvements in\n \n1\n\nbalance and mobility, and even a significant reduction in blood pressure. People in a\ncontrol group who walked on ordinary floors also improved but not as dramatically.\nF\nThe mats are now on sale at $35. “Our first 1000 cobblestone mats sold in three weeks,”\nFisher says. Production is now being scaled up. Even so, demand could exceed supply if\nthis foot-stimulating activity really is a “useful non-pharmacological approach for preventing\nor controlling hypertension of older adults”, as the researchers believe. They are not alone\nin extolling the revitalizing powers of cobblestones. Reflexologists have long advocated\nwalking on textured surfaces to stimulate so-called “acupoints” on the soles of the feet.\nPractitioners of this unorthodox therapy believe that pressure applied to particular spots on\nthe foot connects directly to corresponding organs and somehow enhances their function.\nIn China, spas, hotels, apartment blocks and even factories promote their cobblestone\npaths as healthful amenities. Fisher admits he got the idea from regular visits to the\ncountry. In Beijing and Shanghai city dwellers take daily walks along cobbled paths to\nimprove their health. “In the big cities, people take off their shoes and walk on these paths\nfor 5 or 10 minutes, perhaps several times a day,” Fisher says.\nG\nThe idea is now taking off in Europe too. People in Germany, Austria and Switzerland can\nvisit “barefoot parks” and walk along “paths of the senses” – with mud, logs, stone and\nmoss underfoot – to receive what’s known there as reflexzon-massage. And it is not difficult\nto construct your own “health pathway”. American reflexologists Barbara and Kevin Kunz,\nbased in Albuquerque, New Mexico, advise that you cobble together a walkway using\nbroom handles, bamboo poles, hosepipes, gravel, pebbles, dried peas, driftwood, fallen\nlogs, sand, door mats and strips of turf.\nH\nIf your enthusiasm for DIY doesn’t stretch to this, and Fisher’s cobblestone mats are all\nsold out, there is another option. A new shoe on the market claims to transform flat, hard,\nartificial surfaces into something like natural uneven ground. “These shoes have an\nunbelievable effect,” says Benno Nigg, an exercise scientist at the human performance\nlaboratory of Calgary University in Canada, which has done contract research for the\nshoe’s manufacturers. “They are one of the best things to have happened to humankind for\nyears.” Known as Masai Barefoot Technology, or MBTs, the shoes have rounded soles that\ncause you to rock slightly when you stand still, exercising the small muscles around the\nankle that are responsible for fore-aft stability. Forces in the joint are reduced, putting less\nstrain on the system, Nigg claims.\n \n2",
