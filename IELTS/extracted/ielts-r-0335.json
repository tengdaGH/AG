  "passage_text": "Reading Practice\n \nPersonality and appearance\nWhen Charles Darwin applied to be the “energetic young man” that Robert Fitzroy, the\nBeagle’s captain, sought as his gentleman companion, he was almost let down by a woeful\nshortcoming that was as plain as the nose on his face. Fitzroy believed in\nphysiognomy—the idea that you can tell a person’s character from their appearance. As\nDarwin’s daughter Henrietta later recalled, Fitzroy had “made up his mind that no man with\nsuch a nose could have energy”. This was hardly the case. Fortunately, the rest of Darwin’s\nvisage compensated for his sluggardly proboscis: “His brow saved him.”\nThe idea that a person’s character can be glimpsed in their face dates back to the ancient\nGreeks. It was most famously popularised in the late 18th century by the Swiss poet\nJohann Lavater, whose ideas became a talking point in intellectual circles. In Darwin’s day,\nthey were more or less taken as given. It was only after the subject became associated\nwith phrenology, which fell into disrepute in the late 19th century, that physiognomy was\nwritten off as pseudoscience.\nFirst impressions are highly influential, despite the well-worn admonition not to judge a\nbook by its cover. Within a tenth of a second of seeing an unfamiliar face we have already\nmade a judgement about its owner’s character—caring, trustworthy, aggressive, extrovert,\ncompetent and so on. Once that snap judgement has formed, it is surprisingly hard to\nbudge. People also act on these snap judgements. Politicians with competent-looking faces\nhave a greater chance of being elected, and CEOs who look dominant are more likely to\nrun a profitable company. There is also a well-established “attractiveness halo”. People\nseen as good-looking not only get the most valentines but are also judged to be more\noutgoing, socially competent, powerful, intelligent and healthy.\nIn 1966, psychologists at the University of Michigan asked 84 undergraduates who had\nnever met before to rate each other on five personality traits, based entirely on\nappearance, as they sat for 15 minutes in silence. For three traits—extroversion,\nconscientiousness and openness—the observers’ rapid judgements matched real\npersonality scores significantly more often than chance. More recently, researchers have\nre-examined the link between appearance and personality, notably Anthony Little of the\nUniversity of Stirling and David Perrett of the University of St Andrews, both in the UK.\nThey pointed out that the Michigan studies were not tightly controlled for confounding\nfactors. But when Little and Perrett re-ran the experiment using mugshots rather than live\nsubjects, they also found a link between facial appearance and personality—though only\nfor extroversion and conscientiousness. Little and Perrett claimed that they only found a\ncorrelation at the extremes of personality.\nJustin Carre and Cheryl McCormick of Brock University in Ontario, Canada studied 90 ice-\nhockey players. They found that a wider face in which the cheekbone-to-cheekbone\ndistance was unusually large relative to the distance between brow and upper lip was\nlinked in a statistically significant way with the number of penalty minutes a player was\ngiven for violent acts including slashing, elbowing, checking from behind and fighting. The\nkernel of truth idea isn’t the only explanation on offer for our readiness to make facial\njudgements. Leslie Zebrowitz, a psychologist at Brandeis University in Waltham,\nMassachusetts, says that in many cases snap judgements are not accurate. The snap\njudgement, she says, is often an “overgeneralisation” of a more fundamental response. A\n \n1\n\nclassic example of overgeneralisation can be seen in predators’ response to eye spots, the\nconspicuous circular markings seen on some moths, butterflies and fish. These act as a\ndeterrent to predators because they mimic the eyes of other creatures that the potential\npredators might see as a threat.\nAnother researcher who leans towards overgeneralisation is Alexander Todorov. With\nPrinceton colleague Nikolaas Oosterhof, he recently put forward a theory which he says\nexplains our snap judgements of faces in terms of how threatening they appear. Todorov\nand Oosterhof asked people for their gut reactions to pictures of emotionally neutral faces,\nsifted through all the responses, and boiled them down to two underlying factors: how\ntrustworthy the face looks, and how dominant. Todorov and Oosterhof conclude that\npersonality judgements based on people’s faces are an overgeneralisation of our evolved\nability to infer emotions from facial expressions, and hence a person’s intention to cause us\nharm and their ability to carry it out. Todorov, however, stresses that overgeneralisation\ndoes not rule out the idea that there is sometimes a kernel of truth in these assessments of\npersonality.\nSo if there is a kernel of truth, where does it come from? Perrett has a hunch that the link\narises when our prejudices about faces turn into self-fulfilling prophecies—an idea that was\ninvestigated by other researchers back in 1977. Our expectations can lead us to influence\npeople to behave in ways that confirm those expectations: consistently treat someone as\nuntrustworthy and they end up behaving that way. This effect sometimes works the other\nway round, however, especially for those who look cute. The Nobel prize-winning ethologist\nKonrad Lorenz once suggested that baby-faced features evoke a nurturing response.\nSupport for this has come from work by Zebrowitz, who has found that baby-faced boys\nand men stimulate an emotional centre of the brain, the amygdala, in a similar way. But\nthere’s a twist. Babyfaced men are, on average, better educated, more assertive and apt to\nwin more military medals than their mature-looking counterparts. They are also more likely\nto be criminals; think Al Capone. Similarly, Zebrowitz found baby-faced boys to be\nquarrelsome and hostile, and more likely to be academic highfliers. She calls this the “self-\ndefeating prophecy effect”: a man with a baby face strives to confound expectations and\nends up overcompensating.\nThere is another theory that recalls the old parental warning not to pull faces because they\nmight freeze that way. According to this theory, our personality moulds the way our faces\nlook. It is supported by a study two decades ago which found that angry old people tend to\nlook cross even when asked to strike a neutral expression. A lifetime of scowling,\ngrumpiness and grimaces seemed to have left its mark.\n \n2",
