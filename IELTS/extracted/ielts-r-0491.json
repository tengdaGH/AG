  "passage_text": "Reading Practice\n \nThe History of Pencil\nThe beginning of the story of pencils started with a lightning. Graphite, the main material for\nproducing pencil, was discovered in 1564 in Borrowdale in England when a lightning struck\na local tree during a thunder. Local people found out that the black substance spotted at\nthe root of the unlucky tree was different from burning ash of wood. It was soft, thus left\nmarks everywhere. Chemistry was barely out of its infancy at the time, so people mistook it\nfor lead, equally black but much heavier. It was soon put to use by locals in marking their\nsheep for ownership and calculation.\nBritain turns out to be major country where mines of graphite can be detected and\ndeveloped. Even so, the first pencil was invented elsewhere. As graphite is soft, it requires\nsome form of encasement. In Italy, graphite sticks were initially wrapped in string or\nsheepskin for stability, becoming perhaps the very first pencil in the world. Then around\n1560, an Italian couple made what are likely the first blueprints for the modern, wood-\nencased carpentry pencil. Their version was a flat, oval, more compact type of pencil. Their\nconcept involved the hollowing out of a stick of juniper wood. Shortly thereafter in 1662, a\nsuperior technique was discovered by German people: two wooden halves were carved, a\ngraphite stick inserted, and the halves then glued together - essentially the same method in\nuse to this day. The news of the usefulness of these early pencils spread far and wide,\nattracting the attention of artists all over the known world.\nAlthough graphite core in pencils is still referred to as lead, modern pencils do not contain\nlead as the “lead” of the pencil is actually a mix of finely ground graphite and clay powders.\nThis mixture is important because the amount of clay content added to the graphite\ndepends on the intended pencil hardness, and the amount of time spent on grinding the\nmixture determines the quality of the lead. The more clay you put in, the higher hardness\nthe core has. Many pencils across the world, and almost all in Europe, are graded on the\nEuropean system. This system of naming used B for black and H for hard; a pencil’s grade\nwas described by a sequence or successive Hs or Bs such as BB and BBB for\nsuccessively softer leads, and HH and HHH for successively harder ones. Then the\nstandard writing pencil is graded HB.\n \nIn England, pencils continue to be made from whole sawn graphite. But with the mass\nproduction of pencils, they are getting drastically more popular in many countries with each\npassing decade. As demands rise, appetite for graphite soars.\nAccording to the United States Geological Survey (USGS), world production of natural\ngraphite in 2012 was 1,100,000 tonnes, of which the following major exporters are: China,\nIndia, Brazil, North Korea and Canada. However, much in contrast with its intellectual\napplication in producing pencils, graphite was also widely used in the military. During the\nreign of Elizabeth I, Borrowdale graphite was used as a refractory material to line moulds\nfor cannonballs, resulting in rounder, smoother balls that could be fired farther, contributing\nto the strength of the English navy. This particular deposit of graphite was extremely pure\nand soft, and could easily be broken into sticks. Because of its military importance, this\nunique mine and its production were strictly controlled by the Crown.\nThat the United States did not use pencils in the outer space till they spent $1000 to make\na pencil to use in zero gravity conditions is in fact a fiction. It is widely known that\nastronauts in Russia used grease pencils, which don’t have breakage problem. But it is\n \n1\n\nalso a fact that their counterparts in the United States used pencils in the outer space\nbefore real zero gravity pencil was invented. They preferred mechanical pencils, which\nproduced fine line, much clearer than the smudgy lines left by the grease pencils that\nRussians favored. But the lead tips of these mechanical pencils broke often. That bit of\ngraphite floating around the space capsule could get into someone’s eye, or even find its\nway into machinery or electronics, causing an electrical short or other problems. But\ndespite the fact that the Americans did invent zero gravity pencils later, they stuck to\nmechanical pencils for many years.\nAgainst the backcloth of a digitalized world, the prospect of pencils seems bleak. In reality,\nit does not. The application of pencils has by now become so widespread that they can be\nseen everywhere, such as classrooms, meeting rooms and art rooms, etc. A spectrum of\nusers are likely to continue to use it into the future: students to do math works, artists to\ndraw on sketch pads, waiters or waitresses to mark on order boards, make-up\nprofessionals to apply to faces, and architects to produce blue prints.
