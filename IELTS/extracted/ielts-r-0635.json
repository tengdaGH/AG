  "passage_text": "Reading Practice\n \nWhy don’t babies talk like adults?\nKids go from 'goo-goo' to talkative one step at a time\nA recent e-trade advertisement shows a baby speaking directly to the camera: 'Look at\nthis,’ he says, I'm a free man. I go anywhere I want now.’ He describes his stock-buying\nactivities, and then his phone rings. This advertisement proves what comedians have\nknown for years: few things are as funny as a baby who talks like an adult. But it also\nraises an important question: Why don’t young children express themselves clearly like\nadults?\nMany people assume children learn to talk by copying what they hear. In other words, they\nlisten to the words adults use and the situations in which they use them and imitate\naccordingly. Behaviourism, the scientific approach that dominated American cognitive\nscience for the first half of the 20th century, made exactly this argument.\nHowever, this ’copycat’ theory can’t explain why toddlers aren’t as conversational as adults.\nAfter all, you never hear literate adults express themselves in one-word sentences like\n‘bottle’ or ‘doggie’. In fact, it's easy for scientists to show that a copycat theory of language\nacquisition can’t explain children’s first words. What is hard for them to do is to explain\nthese first words, and how they fit into the language acquisition pattern.\nOver the past half-century, scientists have settled on two reasonable possibilities. The first\nof these is called the ‘mental-developmental hypothesis’. It states that one-year-olds speak\nin baby talk because their immature brains can’t handle adult speech. Children don't learn\nto walk until their bodies are ready. Likewise, they don't speak multi-word sentences or use\nword endings and function words (‘Mummy opened the boxes') before their brains are\nready.\nThe second is called the ‘stages-of-language hypothesis’, which states that the stages of\nprogress in child speech are necessary stages in language development.\nA basketball player can't perfect his or her jump shot before learning to (1) jump and (2)\nshoot. Similarly, children learn to multiply after they have learned to add. This is the order\nin which children are taught - not the reverse. There's evidence, for instance, that children\ndon't usually begin speaking in two-word sentences until they’ve learned a certain number\nof single words.\nIn other words, until they’ve crossed that linguistic threshold, the word-combination process\ndoesn't get going.\nThe difference between these theories is this: under the mental-development hypothesis,\nlanguage learning should depend on the child’s age and level of mental development when\nhe or she starts learning a language. Linder the stages-of-language hypothesis, however, it\nshouldn’t depend on such patterns, but only on the completion of previous stages.\nIn 2007, researchers at Harvard University, who were studying the two theories, found a\nclever way to test them. More than 20,000 internationally adopted children enter the US\neach year. Many of them no longer hear their birth language after they arrive, and they\nmust learn English more or less the same way infants do - that is, by listening and by trial\nand error. International adoptees don’t take classes or use a dictionary when they are\n \n1\n\nlearning their new tongue and most of them don’t have a well-developed first language. All\nof these factors make them an ideal population in which to test these competing\nhypotheses about how language is learned.\nNeuroscientists Jesse Snedeker, Joy Geren and Carissa Shafto studied the language\ndevelopment of 27 children adopted from China between the ages of two and five years.\nThese children began learning English at an older age than US natives and had more\nmature brains with which to tackle the task. Even so, just as with American-born infants,\ntheir first English sentences consisted of single words and were largely bereft of function\nwords, word endings and verbs. The adoptees then went through the same stages as\ntypical American- born children, albeit at a faster clip. The adoptees and native children\nstarted combining words in sentences when their vocabulary reached the same sizes,\nfurther suggesting that what matters is not how old you are or how mature your brain is, but\nthe number of words you know.\nThis finding - that having more mature brains did not help the adoptees avoid the toddler-\ntalk stage - suggests that babies speak in babytalk not because they have baby brains, but\nbecause they have only just started learning and need time to gain enough vocabulary to\nbe able to expand their conversations. Before long, the one-word stage will give way to the\ntwo-word stage and so on. Learning how to chat like an adult is a gradual process.\nBut this potential answer also raises an even older and more difficult question. Adult\nimmigrants who learn a second language rarely achieve the same proficiency in a foreign\nlanguage as the average child raised as a native speaker. Researchers have long\nsuspected there is a ‘critical period’ for language development, after which it cannot\nproceed with full success to fluency. Yet we still do not understand this critical period or\nknow why it ends.\n \n2",
