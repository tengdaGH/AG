  "passage_text": "Reading Practice\n \nMungo Man\nA\nFifty thousand years ago, a lush landscape greeted the first Australians making their way\ntowards the south-east of the continent. Temperatures were cooler than now. Megafauna –\ngiant prehistoric animals such as marsupial lions, goannas and the rhinoceros-sized\ndiprotodon – were abundant. The Lake Mungo remains are three prominent sets of fossils\nwhich tell the archeologists the story: Mungo Man lived around the shores of Lake Mungo\nwith his family. When he was young Mungo Man lost his two lower canine teeth, possible\nknocked out in a ritual. He grew into a man nearly 1.7m in height. Over the years his molar\nteeth became worn and scratched, possibly from eating a gritty diet or stripping the long\nleaves of water reeds with his teeth to make twine. As Mungo Man grew older his bones\nached with arthritis, especially his right elbow, which was so damaged that bits of bone\nwere completely worn out or broken away. Such wear and tear are typical of people who\nhave used a woomera to throw spears over many years. Mungo Man reached a good age\nfor the hard life of a hunter-gatherer and died when he was about 50. His family mourned\nfor him, and carefully buried him in the lunette, on his back with his hands crossed in his\nlap, and sprinkled with red ochre. Mungo Man is the oldest known example in the world of\nsuch a ritual.\nB\nThis treasure-trove of history was found by the University of Melbourne geologist Professor\nJim Bowler in 1969. He was searching for ancient lakes and came across the charred\nremains of Mungo Lady, who had been cremated. And in 1974, he found a second\ncomplete skeleton, Mungo Man, buried 300 metres away. Using carbon-dating, a technique\nonly reliable to around 40,000 years old, the skeleton was first estimated at 28,000 to\n32,000 years old. The comprehensive study of 25 different sediment layers at Mungo\nconcludes that both graves are 40,000 years old.\nC\nThis is much younger than the 62,000 years Mungo Man was attributed within 1999 by a\nteam led by Professor Alan Thorne, of the Australian National University. The modern-day\nstory of the science of Mungo also has its fair share of rivalry. Because Thorne is the\ncountry’s leading opponent of the Out of Africa theory – that Homo sapiens had a single\nplace of origin. “Dr Alan Thorne supports the multi-regional explanation (that modern\nhumans arose simultaneously in Africa, Europe and Asia from one of our predecessors,\nHomo erectus, who left Africa more than 1.5 million years ago.) if Mungo Man was\ndescended from a person who had left Africa in the past 200,000 years, Thorne argues,\nthen his mitochondrial DNA should have looked like that of the other samples.”\nD\nHowever, Out of Africa supporters are not about to let go of their beliefs because of the\nAustralian research, Professor Chris Stringer, from the Natural History Museum in London,\nUK, said that the research community would want to see the work repeated in other labs\nbefore major conclusions were drawn from the Australian research. But even assuming the\nDNA sequences were correct, Professor Stringer said it could just mean that there was\n \n1\n\nmuch more genetic diversity in the past than was previously realised. There is no evidence\nhere that the ancestry of these Australian fossils goes back a million or two million years.\nIt’s much more likely that modern humans came out of Africa.” For Bowler, these debates\nare irritating speculative distractions from the study’s main findings. At 40,000 years old,\nMungo Man and Mungo Lady remain Australian’s oldest human burials and the earliest\nevidence on Earth of cultural sophistication, he says. Modern humans had not even\nreached North America by this time. In 1997, Pddbo’s research group recovered an mtDNA\nfingerprint from the Feldholer Neanderthal skeleton uncovered in Germany in 1865 – the\nfirst Neanderthal remains ever found.\nE\nIn its 1999 study, Thorne’s team used three techniques to date Mungo Man at 62,000 years\nold, and it stands by its figures. It dated bone, teeth enamel and some sand. Bowler has\nstrongly challenged the results ever since. Dating human bones is “notoriously unreliable”,\nhe says. As well, the sand sample Thorne’s group dated was taken hundreds of metres\nfrom the burial site. “You don’t have to be a gravedigger … to realize the age of the sand is\nnot the same as the age of the grave,” says Bowler.\nF\nThorne counters that Bowler’s team used one dating technique, while he used three. The\nbest practice is to have at least two methods produce the same result. A Thorne team\nmember, Professor Rainer Grün, says the fact that the latest results were consistent\nbetween laboratories doesn’t mean they are absolutely correct. We now have two data sets\nthat are contradictory. I do not have a plausible explanation.” Now, however, Thorne says\nthe age of Mungo Man is irrelevant to this origins debate. Recent fossils find show modern\nhumans were in China 110,000 years ago. “So he has got a long time to turn up in\nAustralia. It doesn’t matter if he is 40,000 or 60,000 years old.\nG\nDr Tim Flannery, a proponent of the controversial theory that Australia’s megafauna were\nwiped out 46,000 years ago in a “blitzkrieg” of hunting by the arriving people, also claims\nthe new Mungo dates support this view. In 2001 a member of Bowler’s team, Dr Richard\nRoberts of Wollongong University, along with Flannery, director of the South Australian\nMuseum, published research on their blitzkrieg theory. They dated 28 sites across the\ncontinent, arguing their analysis showed the megafauna died out suddenly 46,000 years\nago. Flannery praises the Bowler team’s research on Mungo Man as “the most thorough\nand rigorous dating” of ancient human remains. He says the finding that humans arrived at\nLake Mungo between 46,000 and 50,000 years ago was a critical time in Australia’s\nhistory. There is no evidence of a dramatic climatic change then, he says. “It’s my view that\nhumans arrived and extinction took place in almost the same geological instant.”\nH\nBowler, however, is skeptical of Flannery’s theory and says the Mungo study provides no\ndefinitive new evidence to support it. He argues that climate change at 40,000 years ago\nwas more intense than had been previously realized and could have played a role in the\nmegafauna’s demise. “To blame the earliest Australians for their complete extinction is\ndrawing a longbow.”\n \n2",
