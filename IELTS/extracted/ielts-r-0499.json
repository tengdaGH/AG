  "passage_text": "Reading Practice\n \nThe Impact of Environment to Children\nA\nWhat determines how a child develops? In reality, it would be impossible to account for\neach and every influence that ultimately determines who a child becomes. What we can\nlook at are some of the most apparent influences such as genetics, parenting, experiences,\nfriends, family relationships and school to help us understand the influences that help\ncontribute to a child’s growth.\nB\nThink of these influences as building blocks. While roost people tend to have the same\nbasic building blocks, these components can be put together in an infinite number of ways.\nConsider your own overall personality. How much of who you are today was shaped by\nyour genetic inheritance, and how much is a result of your lifetime of experiences? This\nquestion has puzzled philosophers, psychologists and educators for hundreds of years and\nis frequently referred to as the nature versus nurture debate. Generally, the given rate of\ninfluence on children is 40 % to 50%. It may refer to all of siblings of a family. Are we the\nresult of nature (our genetic background) or nurture (our environment)? Today, most\nresearchers agree that child development involves a complex interaction of both nature and\nnurture, while some aspects of development may be strongly influenced by biology,\nenvironmental influences may also play a role. For example, the timing of when the onset\nof puberty occurs is largely the results of heredity, but environmental factors such as\nnutrition can also have an effect.\nC\nThe From the earliest moments of life, the interaction of heredity and the environment\nworks to shape who children are and who they will become. While the genetic instructions\na child inherits from his parents may set out a road map for development, the environment\ncan impact how these directions are expressed, shaped or event silenced. The complex\ninteraction of nature and nurture does not just occur at certain moments or at certain\nperiods of time; it is persistent and lifelong.\nD\nThe shared environment (also called common environment) refers to environmental\ninfluences that have the effect of making siblings more similar to one another. Shared\nenvironmental influences can include shared family experiences, shared peer groups, and\nsharing the same school and community. In general, there has not been strong evidence\nfor shared environmental effects on many behaviors, particularly those measured in adults.\nPossible reasons for this are discussed. Shared environmental effects are evident in\nchildren and adolescents, but these effects generally decrease across the life span. New\ndevelopments in behavior genetic methods have made it possible to specify shared\nenvironments of importance and to tease apart familial and nonfamilial sources of shared\nenvironmental influence. It may also refer to all of siblings of a family, but the rate of\ninfluence is less than 10 per cent.\nE\n \n1\n\nThe importance of non-shared environment lay hidden within quantitative genetic studies\nsince they began nearly a century ago. Quantitative genetic methods, such as twin and\nadoption methods, were designed to tease apart nature and nurture in order to explain\nfamily resemblance. For nearly all complex phenotypes, it has emerged that the answer to\nthe question of the origins of family resemblance is nature-things run in families primarily\nfor genetic reasons. However, the best available evidence for the importance of\nenvironmental influence comes from this same quantitative genetic research because\ngenetic influence never explains all of the variances for complex phenotypes, and the\nremaining variance must be ascribed to environmental influences. Non-shared\nenvironment, it may refer to the part of siblings of a family, the rate of influence to children\nis 40 % to 50%.\nF\nYet it took many decades for the full meaning of these findings to emerge. If genetics\nexplains why siblings growing up in the same family are similar, but the environment is\nimportant, then it must be the case that the salient environmental effects do not make\nsiblings similar. That is, they are not shared by children growing up in the same family-they\nmust be ‘non-shared’. This implication about non-shared environmental import lay fallow in\nthe field of quantitative genetics because the field’s attention was then firmly on the nature-\nnurture debate. ‘Nurture’ in the nature-nurture debate was implicitly taken to mean shared\nenvironment because, from Freud onwards, theories of socialization had assumed that\nchildren’s environments are doled out on a family-by-family basis. In contrast, the point of\nthe non-shared environment is that environments are doled out on a child-by-child basis.\nNote that the phrase ‘non-shared environment’ is shorthand for a component of phenotypic\nvariance-it refers to ‘effects’ rather than ‘events’, as discussed later. Research in recent\nyears suggested that the impact from parents will be easy to be interrupted by the influence\nfrom the children of the same age. That also showed that variations of knowledge that\nchildren get from other culture are increasing. A number of interests between, whatever,\nfathers and mothers or parents and their children are conflicting.\nG\nBecause siblings living in the same home share some but not all of the potential genetic\nand environmental factors that influence their behaviors, teasing apart the potential\ninfluences of genetic and non-genetic factors that differentiate siblings is very difficult.\nTurkheimer and Waldron (2000) have noted that non-shared environmental\ninfluences——which include all of the random measurement error——may not be\nsystematic, but instead may operate idiosyncratically and in ways that cannot be\nascertained. Thus, the question is whether or not quasi-experimental behavioral genetic\ndesigns can be used to actually identify systematic non-shared environmental mechanisms\ncross-sectionally and longitudinally. This is the impetus for the current study.\n \n2",
