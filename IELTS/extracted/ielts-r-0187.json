Without forces of gravitation, Earth and other planets would be unable to stay in their\norbits around the Sun. the Moon would be unable to orbit the Earth, tidal waves would not\noccur and the rising of hot air or water convection would be impossible. Gravitation is a\nphenomenon winch allows objects to attract other matter; the physics behind it have been\nexplained in The Theory of Relativity and Newton’s Law of Universal Gravitation; though\nattempts to explain gravity hail back to ancient times. In 4th Century B.C. the Greek\nphilosopher Aristotle developed the hypothesis that all objects were drawn into their correct\nposition by crystalline spheres and that a physical mass would fall towards the earth in\ndirect proportion to its weight.\nB. In the late 16th century Galileo deduced that while gravitation propels all objects to the\nground at the same rate, air resistance resulted in heavier objects appearing to fall more\nquickly; his theories contradicting earlier belief systems put in place by Aristotle and others;\nso paving the way for formulation of the modern theories of today. Though the two terms\nare now used interchangeably in layman use, strictly by scientific definition, there are\ndistinct differences between ‘gravitation’ and ‘gravity’. The first relates to the influence\nexerted by different objects which allow them to attract other objects, whereas ‘gravity’\nrefers specifically to the force possessed by such objects which facilitates gravitation.\nCertain scientific theories hold that gravitation may be initiated by a combination of factors\nand not simply the existence of gravity alone; though doubts have been raised regarding\nsome of these theories.\nC. Gravity is directly proportional to mass; a smaller object possessing less gravity. To\nillustrate, the Moon is a quarter of the Earth’s size and possesses only 1/6 of its gravity.\nThe mass of the Earth itself is not spread out proportionally, being flatter at the poles than\nthe equator as a result of its rotation; gravity and gravitational pull in different locations\nthroughout the world also vary. In the 1960s, as a result of research into the worldwide\ngravity fields, it was discovered that inexplicably areas around and including the Hudson\nBay area of Canada appeared to possess significantly lower levels of gravity than other\nparts of the globe; the reasons for this dissimilarity have since been extensively\ninvestigated resulting in two explanations.\nD. The original theory presented attributed this anomaly to activity which occurs 100-200\nkilometres below the Earth’s surface within the layer known as the ‘mantle’. The mantle is\ncomprised of hot molten rock known as magma which flows under the earth’s surface\ncausing convection currents. These convection currents can result in the lowering of the\ncontinental plates which make up the Earth’s surface, as a result when this occurs, the\nmass in that area and its gravity is also reduced. Research findings indicated that such\nactivity had occurred in the Hudson Bay region.\nE. More recently a second conjecture suggested that, in fact, lower levels of gravity in the\narea are a result of occurrences during the Ice Age. The Laurentidelcesheet, which\ncovered most of Canada and the northern tip of the USA until it melted 10,000 years ago, is\nthought to have been 3.2 kms thick in most parts and 3.7 kms thick over two areas of\nHudson Bay. The sheer weight of the ice layer weighed down the surface of the earth\nbelow, leaving a deep indentation once it had melted, having caused the area around\nHudson Bay to become thinner as the earth’s surface was pushed to the edges of the\n1\n\nicesheet.\nF. Extensive investigation has since been carried out by the Harvard-Smithsonian Center\nfor Astrophysics using data collected by satellites during the Gravity Recovery and Climate\nExperiment (GRACE) between 2002 and 2006. The satellites are placed 220kms apart and\norbit 500kms above Earth. Being extremely sensitive to even minor differences in\ngravitational pull of the areas of earth they pass over, as the first satellite enters an area\nwith decreased gravity it moves slightly away from the earth as the gravitational pull is\nreduced and also moves slightly further away from the sister satellite that follows, such\nactivity allowing scientists to create maps of gravitational fields. The GRACE findings also\nallowed scientists to estimate the appearance of Hudson Bay over 10,000 years ago, prior\nto the great thaw. The areas possessing the lowest gravity today correlate with the areas\ncovered in the thickest layers of ice at that time.\nG. Researchers now believe that both theories regarding reduced gravity levels in the\nHudson Bay region are accurate and that the area’s characteristics are a result of both\nmagma activity and the impact of the Laurentidelcesheet. It has been estimated that the\nformer has resulted in 55-75% of gravity reduction and that pressure resulting from the\nlatter accounts for 25-45%.\nH. The effects of the Laurentidelcesheet are reversible due to the earth layer’s capability to\n‘rebound’ in response to removal of the weight which once restricted it. Return to the\noriginal position, however, is an extremely slow process; it is estimated that the area\naround Hudson Bay will take a further 5,000 years to recover the altitude it once possessed\nprior to the Laurentidelcesheet. The rebound activity in the area is also measurable through\nobservation of sea levels; unlike the rest of the world, sea levels are not rising in the area\nas a result of melting icecaps, but are dropping as the land recovers its previous form\nI.  Research conducted into the Laurentidelcesheet has significant implications on a global\nscale. The increased knowledge of how that particular area has changed over time and the\nlong-term implications activity in the Ice Age had, pave the way to a better understanding of\nhow current changes elsewhere will manifest themselves over the long term.\n2",
