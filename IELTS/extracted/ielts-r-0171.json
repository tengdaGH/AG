  "passage_text": "Reading Practice\n \nFossil Files “The Paleobiology Database”\nA. Are we now living through the sixth extinction as our own activities destroy ecosystems\nand wipe out diversity? That’s the doomsday scenario painted by many ecologists, and\nthey may well be right. The trouble is we don’t know for sure because we don’t have a clear\npicture of how life changes between extinction events or what has happened in previous\nepisodes. We don’t even know how many species are alive today, let alone the rate at\nwhich they are becoming extinct. A new project aims to fill some of the gaps. The\nPaleobiology Database aspires to be an online repository of information about every fossil\never dug up. It is a huge undertaking that has been described as biodiversity’s equivalent\nof the Human Genome Project. Its organizers hope that by recording the history of\nbiodiversity they will gain an insight into how environmental changes have shaped life on\nEarth in the past and how they might do so in the future. The database may even indicate\nwhether life can rebound no matter what we throw at it, or whether a human induced\nextinction could be without parallel, changing the rules that have applied throughout the\nrest of the planet’s history.\n \nB. But already the project is attracting harsh criticism. Some experts believe it to be\nseriously flawed. They point out that a database is only as good as the data fed into it, and\nthat even if all the current fossil finds were catalogued, they would provide an incomplete\ninventory of life because we are far from discovering every fossilised species. They say\nthat researchers should get up from their computers and get back into the dirt to dig up new\nfossils. Others are more sceptical still, arguing that we can never get the full picture\nbecause the fossil record is riddled with holes and biases.\nC. Fans of the Paleobiology Database acknowledge that the fossil record will always be\nincomplete. But they see value in looking for global patterns that show relative changes in\nbiodiversity. “The fossil record is the best tool we have for understanding how diversity and\nextinction work in normal times,” says John Alroy from the National Center for Ecological\nAnalysis and Synthesis in Santa Barbara. “Having a background extinction estimate gives\nUS a benchmark for understanding the mass extinction that’s currently under way. It allows\nus to say just how bad it is in relative terms.”\nD. To this end, the Paleobiology Database aims to be the most thorough attempt yet to\ncome up with good global diversity curves. Every day between 10 and 15 scientists around\nthe world add information about fossil finds to the database. Since it got up and running in\n1998, scientists have entered almost 340,000 specimens, ranging from plants to whales to\ninsects to dinosaurs to sea urchins. Overall totals are updated hourly at www.paleodb.org.\nAnyone can download data from the public part of the site and play with the numbers to\ntheir heart’s content. Already, the database has thrown up some surprising results. Looking\nat the big picture, Alroy and his colleagues believe they have found evidence that\nbiodiversity reached a plateau long ago, contrary to the received wisdom that species\nnumbers have increased continuously between extinction events. “The traditional view is\nthat diversity has gone up and up and up,” he says. “Our research is showing that diversity\nlimits were approached many tens of millions of years before the dinosaurs evolved, much\nless suffered extinction.” This suggests that only a certain number of species can live on\nEarth at a time, filling a prescribed number of niches like spaces in a multi-storey car park.\nOnce it’s full, no more new species can squeeze in, until extinctions free up new spaces or\n \n1\n\nsomething rare and catastrophic adds a new floor to the car park.\n \nE. Alroy has also used the database to reassess the accuracy of species names. His\nfindings suggest that irregularities in classification inflate the overall number of species in\nthe fossil record by between 32 and 44 per cent. Single species often end up with several\nnames, he says, due to misidentification or poor communication between taxonomists in\ndifferent countries. Repetition like this can distort diversity curves. “If you have really bad\ntaxonomy in one short interval, it will look like a diversity spike—a big diversification\nfollowed by a big extinction-when all that has happened is a change in the quality of\nnames,” says Alroy. For example, his statistical analysis indicates that of the 4861 North\nAmerican fossil mammal species catalogued in the database, between 24 and 31 per cent\nwill eventually prove to be duplicates.\nF. Of course, the fossil record is undeniably patchy. Some places and times have left\nbehind more fossil-filled rocks than others. Some have been sampled more thoroughly.\nAnd certain kinds of creatures—those with hard parts that lived in oceans, for example–are\nmore likely to leave a record behind, while others, like jellyfish, will always remain a\nmystery. Alroy has also tried to account for this. He estimates, for example, that only 41 per\ncent of North American mammals that have ever lived are known from fossils, and he\nsuspects that a similar proportion of fossils are missing from other groups, such as fungi\nand insects.\n \nG. Not everyone is impressed with such mathematical wizardry. Jonathan Adrain from the\nUniversity of Iowa in Iowa City points out that statistical wrangling has been known to\ncreate mass extinctions where none occurred. It is easy to misinterpret data. For example,\nchanges in sea level or inconsistent sampling methods can mimic major changes in\nbiodiversity. Indeed, a recent and thorough examination of the literature on marine bivalve\nfossils has convinced David Jablonsky from the University of Chicago and his colleagues\nthat their diversity has increased steadily over the past 5 million years.\nH. With an inventory of all living species, ecologists could start to put the current\nbiodiversity crisis in historical perspective. Although creating such a list would be a task to\nrival even the Palaeobiology Database, it is exactly what the San Francisco-based ALL\nSpecies Foundation hopes to achieve in the next 25 years. The effort is essential, says\nHarvard biologist Edward o. Wilson, who is alarmed by current rates of extinction. “There is\na crisis. We’ve begun to measure it, and it’s very high,” Wilson says. “We need this kind of\ninformation in much more detail to protect all of biodiversity, not just the ones we know\nwell.” Let the counting continue.\n \n2",
