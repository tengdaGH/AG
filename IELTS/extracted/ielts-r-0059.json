  "passage_text": "Reading Practice\n \nBamboo\nBamboo is a common woody plant. It grows tall and thin. It looks almost like a tree! It grows\nabout twenty five metres tall. It is about fifteen centimetres wide. Bamboo looks like it is\nmade of many small pieces. Thick lines divide it into small segments. And the inside of\nbamboo is empty. But it is hard and very strong.\nMany people think bamboo is a tree. But it is not - it is a kind of grass. It grows mainly in\nEast and South East Asia. It also grows in Latin America, India and parts of Africa and\nAustralia. Bamboo grows extremely fast and spreads very quickly. There are 1500 different\nkinds of bamboo. People all over the world use it. And people are planting more of it. Some\npeople call bamboo ‘the crop of the future.’ They have many good reasons to plant\nbamboo.\nThere are over 1,000 uses for bamboo! People in the past used bamboo for many things.\nThey made musical instruments and weapons with bamboo. Artists used it for paintbrushes\nand paper. Fishermen used it to make equipment for catching fish. Some people even\nmade boats from bamboo!\nIn China and India, doctors use bamboo in traditional medicine. Bamboo is also very useful\nfor cooking. People put food inside the empty bamboo plant. This is a good container for\ncooking soup, rice or tea. But people also eat bamboo as a healthy food. People eat the\nsoft part, or shoot, of the bamboo in many ways. Most Asian countries have special foods\nmade from bamboo shoots.\nBamboo has been used in traditional buildings. But builders also use it today! The village of\nNoh Bo is just one example.\nThere are many modern uses for bamboo. In 1879 Thomas Edison created the first light\nbulb. He made it with treated bamboo!\nPeople also use bamboo to make cloth. Beauty products sometimes contain bamboo. It is\neven in some water filters, to clean water! People have even designed vehicles and\nairplanes out of bamboo. In Ghana, people even make two wheeled bicycles from bamboo.\nIn the Philippines, people make electricity from bamboo! Buildings, bicycles, light bulbs and\neven electricity: bamboo is an amazing plant.\nThese are just a few of the many ways people use bamboo. But bamboo is useful for a\nmuch more important reason. It is useful while it grows! Growing bamboo helps the\nenvironment in many ways. Bamboo provides oxygen, which improves air quality. It also\nreduces harmful carbon dioxide in the air. It does this more quickly than trees. Bamboo\nalso provides shade and shelter from the sun.\nIn many places, hardwood trees are cut down for fuel or for building. This causes problems\nfor the earth, animals, plants and air. To keep a good environment, people must replace\nthe trees. But it takes a very long time for most trees to reach their full size. Many\nhardwood trees take 50 years to grow!\nBamboo is ready to use in only three years. Bamboo is the fastest growing woody plant in\nthe world. It can grow about 60 centimeters in only one day. The bamboo plant grows to its\nfull size in just three or four months. Some kinds of bamboo then become dry and hard. In\n \n1\n\nthree years, it is strong enough to harvest and use. And bamboo grows again when it is cut\ndown. People can harvest it year after year.\nSome people are sure that bamboo is ‘the crop of the future’. For example, Nicaragua has\nmany hardwood forests. But people are cutting down three percent of the forests every\nyear. One organization, Eco-planet Bamboo, is trying to replace these trees with bamboo.\nEco-Planet Bamboo planted a large bamboo farm. Through this farm, Eco-Planet Bamboo\nhopes to improve the environment. They also hope to improve life for local people. Bamboo\nis helping to reduce poverty in Nicaragua. \nIn Nicaragua, bamboo is providing jobs. Around the world, it is improving the environment\nand the economy. It is easy to see why people call bamboo the ‘crop of the future.’\n \n2",
