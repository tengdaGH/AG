  "passage_text": "Reading Practice\n \nThe Climate Changers\nThe romantic notion that early humans lived in harmony with their environment has taken\nquite a battering lately. Modem humans may have started eliminating other species right\nfrom the start; our ancestors stand accused of wiping out mega fauna – from giant flightless\nbirds in Australia to mammoths in Asia and the ground sloth of North America – as they\nspread across the planet.\nEven so, by around 6,000 years ago there were only about 12 million people on earth –\nless than a quarter of the current population of Great Britain. That’s a far cry from today’s\n6.6 billion, many of us guzzling fossil fuels, churning out greenhouse gases and messing\nwith our planet’s climate like there’s no tomorrow. So it may seem far-fetched to suggest\nthat humans have been causing global warming ever since our ancestors started burning\nand cutting forests to make way for fields at least 7,000 years ago.\nYet that’s the view of retired climate scientist William Ruddiman, formerly of the University\nof Virginia, Charlottesville. Ancient farmers were pumping climate-warming carbon dioxide\nand methane into the atmosphere long before recorded history began, he says. Far from\ncausing catastrophe, however, early farmers halted the planet’s descent into another ice\nage and kept Earth warm and stable for thousands of years.\nCould a few primitive farmers really have changed the climate of the entire globe? If you\nfind this hard to believe, you’re not the only one. Ruddiman’s idea has been hugely\ncontroversial ever since he proposed it in 2003. ‘Most new ideas, especially controversial\nones, die out pretty fast. It doesn’t take science long to weed them out,’ he says. Yet five\nyears on, his idea is still not dead. On the contrary, he says the latest evidence strengthens\nhis case. ‘It has become clear that natural explanations for the rise in greenhouse gases\nover the past few thousand years are the ones that are not measuring up, and we can\nreject them,’he claims.\nThere is no doubt that the soaring levels of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases\nthat we see in the atmosphere today – causing a 0.7° C rise in average global temperature\nduring the 20thcentury – are the result of human activities. In the late 1990s, however,\nRuddiman started to suspect that our contribution to the global greenhouse began to\nbecome significant long before the industrial age began. This was when an ice core drilled\nat the Vostok station in Antarctica revealed how atmospheric C02 and methane levels have\nchanged over the past 400,000 years. Bubbles trapped in the ice provide a record of the\nancient atmosphere during the past three interglacials.\nWhat we see is a regular pattern of rises and falls with a period of about 100,000 years,\ncoinciding with the coming and going of ice ages. There are good explanations for these\ncycles: periodic changes in the planet’s orbit and axis of rotation alter the amount of\nsunlight reaching the Earth. We are now in one of the relatively brief, warm interglacial\nperiods that follow an ice age.\nWithin this larger pattern there are regular peaks in methane every 22,000 years that\ncoincide with the times when the Earth’s orbit makes summers in the northern hemisphere\nwarmest. This makes sense, because warm northern summers drive strong tropical\nmonsoons in southern Asia that both encourage the growth of vegetation and cause\nflooding, during which vegetation rotting in oxygen-poor water will emit methane. Around\n \n1\n\nthe Arctic, hot summers thaw wetlands for longer, again promoting both vegetation growth\nand methane emission.\nIn recent times, however, this regular pattern has changed. The last methane peak\noccurred around 11,000 years ago, at about 700 parts per billion (ppb), after which levels\nbegan to fall. But instead of continuing to fall to what Ruddiman says should have been a\nminimum of about 450 ppb today, the atmospheric methane began to climb again 5,000\nyears ago.\nWorking with climate modellers Stephen Verves and John Kutzbach, Ruddiman has shown\nthat if the levels of these gases had continued to fall rather than rising when they did, ice\nsheets would now cover swathes of northern Canada and Siberia. The world would be\nheading into another ice age.\nSo why did both methane and C02 rise over the past few thousand years? In other words,\nwhy has this interglacial period been different from previous ones? Could humans be to\nblame?\nAgriculture emerged around the eastern Mediterranean some 11,000 years ago, then\nshortly afterwards in China and several thousand years later in the Americas. Farming can\nrelease greenhouse gases in various ways: clearing forests liberates lots of stored carbon\nas the wood rots or is burned, for instance, while flooded rice paddies release methane just\nas wetlands do.\n \n \nTo find out more about early farming, Ruddiman began to dig around in studies of\nagricultural history.These revealed that there was a sharp rise in rice cultivation in Asia\naround 5,000 years ago, with the practice spreading across China and south-east Asia.\nHere at least was a possible source for the unexpected methane rise.\n \n2",
