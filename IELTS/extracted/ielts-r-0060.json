  "passage_text": "Reading Practice\n \nBecoming an Expert\nA. Expertise is commitment coupled with creativity. Specifically, it is the commitment of\ntime, energy, and resource to a relatively narrow field of study and the creative\nenergy necessary to generate new knowledge in that field. It takes a considerable\namount of time and regular exposure to a large number of cases to become an\nexpert.\nB. An individual enters a field of study as a novice. The novice needs to learn the\nguiding principles and rules of a given task in order to perform that task. Concurrently,\nthe novice needs to be exposed to specific cases, or instances, that test the\nboundaries of such principles. Generally, a novice will find a mentor to guide her\nthrough the process of acquiring new knowledge. A fairly simple example would be\nsomeone learning to play chess. The novice chess player seeks a mentor to tech her\nthe object of the game, the number of spaces, the names of the pieces, the function\nof each piece, how each piece is moved, and the necessary conditions for winning or\nlosing the game.\nC. In time, and with much practice, the novice begins to recognize patterns of behavior\nwithin cases and, thus, becomes a journeyman. With more practice and exposure to\nincreasingly complex cases, the journeyman finds patterns not only within cases but\nalso between cases. More importantly, the journeyman learns that these patterns\noften repeat themselves over time. The journeyman still maintains regular contact\nwith a mentor to solve specific problems and learn more complex strategies.\nReturning to the example of the chess player, the individual begins to learn patterns\nof opening moves, offensive and defensive game - playing strategies, and patterns of\nvictory and defeat.\nD. When a journeyman starts to make and test hypotheses about future behavior based\non past experiences, she begins the next transition. Once she creatively generates\nknowledge, rather than simply matching superficial patterns, she becomes an expert.\nAt this point, she is confident in her knowledge and no longer needs a mentor as a\nguide - she becomes responsible for her own knowledge. In the chess example, once\na journey man begins competing against experts, makes predictions based on\npatterns, and tests those predictions against actual behavior, she is generating new\nknowledge and a deeper understanding of the game. She is creating her own cases\nrather than relying on the cases of others.\nE. The chess example is a rather short description of an apprenticeship model.\nApprenticeship may seem like a restrictive 18th century mode of education, but it is\nstill a standard method of training for many complex tasks. Academic doctoral\nprograms are based on an apprenticeship model, as are fields like law, music,\nengineering, and medicine. Graduate students enter fields of study, find mentors, and\nbegin the long process of becoming independent experts and generating new\nknowledge in their respective domains.\nF.\nexpert depends on the complexity of the task and the number of cases, or patterns, to\nPsychologists and cognitive scientists agree that the time it takes to become an\n \n1\n\nwhich an individual is exposed. The more complex the task, the longer it takes to\nbuild expertise, or, more accurately, the longer it takes to experience and store a\nlarge number of cases or patterns. The Power of Expertise\nG. An expert perceives meaningful patterns in her domain better than non-experts.\nWhere a novice perceives random or disconnected data points, an expert connects\nregular patterns within and between cases. This ability to identify patterns is not an\ninnate perceptual skill; rather it reflects the organization of knowledge after exposure\nto and experience with thousands of cases. Experts have a deeper understanding of\ntheir domains than novices do, and utilize higher -order principles to solve problems.\nA novice, for example, might group objects together by color or size, whereas an\nexpert would group the same objects according to their function or utility. Experts\ncomprehend the meaning of data and weigh variables with different criteria within\ntheir domains better then novices.Experts recognized variables that have the largest\ninfluence on a particular problem and focus their attention on those variables.\nH. Experts have better domain -specific short -term and long -term memory than novices\ndo. Moreover, experts perform task in their domains faster than novices and commit\nfewer errors while problem solving. Interestingly, experts go about solving problems\ndifferently than novices. Experts spend more time thinking about a problem to fully\nunderstand it at the beginning of a task than do novices, who immediately seek to\nfind a solution. Experts use their knowledge of previous cases as context for\nincreasing mental models to solve given problems.\nI. Better at self-monitoring then novices, experts are more aware of instances where\nthey have committed errors or failed to understand a problem. Experts check their\nsolutions more often than novices and recognize when they are missing information\nnecessary for solving a problem. Experts are aware of the limits of their domain\nknowledge and apply their domain's heuristics to solve problems that fall outside of\ntheir experience base. The Paradox of Expertise\nJ. The strengths of expertise can also be weaknesses. Although one would expect\nexperts to be good forecasters, they are not particularly good at making predictions\nabout the future. Since the 1930s, researchers have been testing the ability of experts\nto make forecasts. The performance of experts has been tested against actuarial\ntables to determine if they are better at making predictions than simple statistical\nmodels. Seventy years later, with more than two hundred experiments in different\ndomains, it is clear that the answer is no. If supplied with an equal amount of data\nabout a particular case, an actuarial table is as good, or better, than an expert at\nmaking calls about the future. Even if an expert is given more specific case\ninformation than is available to the statistical model, the expert does not tend to\noutperform the actuarial table.\nK.\nforecasters than statistical models. Some have argued that experts, like all humans,\nare inconsistent when using mental models to make predictions. A number of\nresearchers point to human biases to explain unreliable expert predictions. During the\nlast 30 years, researchers have categorized, experimented, and theorized about the\ncognitive aspects of forecasting. Despite such efforts, the literature shows little\nconsensus regarding the causes or manifestations of human bias\nTheorists and researchers differ when trying to explain why experts are less accurate\n \n2",
