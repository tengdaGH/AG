  "passage_text": "Reading Practice\nPlant Scents\nA\n \n \nEveryone is familiar with scented flowers, and many people have heard that floral odors\nhelp the plant attract pollinators. This common notion is mostly correct, but it is surprising\nhow little scientific proof of it exists. Of course, not all flowers are pollinated by biological\nagents – for example, many grasses are wind-pollinated – but the flowers of the grasses\nmay still emit volatiles. In fact, plants emit organic molecules all the time, although they\nmay not be obvious to the human nose. As for flower scents that we can detect with our\nnoses, bouquets that attract moths and butterflies generally smell “sweet,” and those that\nattract certain flies seem “rotten” to us.\nB\nThe release of volatiles from vegetative parts of the plant is familiar, although until recently\nthe physiological functions of these chemicals were less clear and had received much less\nattention from scientists. When the trunk of a pine tree is injured – for example, when a\nbeetle tries to burrow into it – it exudes a very smelly resin. This resin consists mostly of\nterpenes – hydrocarbons with a backbone of 10, 15 or 20 carbons that may also contain\natoms of oxygen. The heavier C20 terpenes, called diterpenes, are glue-like and can cover\nand immobilize insects as they plug the hole. This defense mechanism is as ancient as it is\neffective: Many samples of fossilized resin, or amber, contain the remains of insects\ntrapped inside. Many other plants emit volatiles when injured, and in some cases the\nemitted signal helps defend the plant. For example, (Z)-3-hexenyl acetate, which is known\nas a “green leaf volatile” because it is emitted by many plants upon injury, deters females\nof the moth Heliothis virescens from laying eggs on injured tobacco plants. Interestingly,\nthe profile of emitted tobacco volatiles is different at night than during the day, and it is the\nnocturnal blend, rich in several (Z)-3-hexen-1-olesters, that is most effective in repelling the\nnight-active H. virescens moths.\nC\nHerbivore induced volatiles often serve as indirect defenses. These bulwarks exist in a\nvariety of plant species, including corn, beans, and the model plant species Arabidopsis\nthaliana. Plants not only emit volatiles acutely, at the site where caterpillars, mites, aphids\nor similar insects are eating them but also generally from non-damaged parts of the plant.\nThese signals attract a variety of predatory insects that prey on the plant-eaters. For\nexample, some parasitic wasps can detect the volatile signature of a damaged plant and\nwill lay their eggs inside the offending caterpillar; eventually, the wasp eggs hatch, and the\nemerging larvae feed on the caterpillar from the inside hatch, and the emerging larvae feed\non the caterpillar from the inside out. The growth of infected caterpillars is retarded\nconsiderably, to the benefit of the plant. Similarly, volatiles released by plants in response\nto herbivore egg laying can attract parasites of the eggs, thereby preventing them from\nhatching and avoiding the onslaught of hungry herbivores that would have emerged. Plant\nvolatiles can also be used as a kind of currency in some very indirect defensive schemes.\nIn the rainforest understory tree Leonardoxa Africana, ants of the species Petalomyrmex\n \n1\n\nphylax patrol young leaves and attack any herbivorous insects that they encounter. The\nyoung leaves emit high levels of the volatile compound methyl salicylate, a compound that\nthe ants use either as a pheromone or as an antiseptic in their nests. It appears that methyl\nsalicylate is both an attractant and a reward offered by the tree to get the ants to perform\nthis valuable deterrent role.\nD\nFloral scent has a strong impact on the economic success of many agricultural crops that\nrely on insect pollinators, including fruit trees such as the bee-pollinated cherry, apple,\napricot and peach, as well as vegetables and tropical plants such as papaya. Pollination\nnot only affects crop yield, but also the quality and efficiency of crop production. Many\ncrops require most, if not all, ovules to be fertilized for optimum fruit size and shape. A\ndecrease in fragrance emission reduces the ability of flowers to attract pollinators and\nresults in considerable losses for growers, particularly for introduced species that had a\nspecialized pollinator in their place of origin. This problem has been exacerbated by recent\ndisease epidemics that have killed many honeybees, the major insect pollinators in the\nUnited States.\nE\nOne means by which plant breeders circumvent the pollination problem is by breeding self-\ncompatible, or apomictic, varieties that do not require fertilization. Although this solution is\nadequate, its drawbacks include near genetic uniformity and consequent susceptibility to\npathogens. Some growers have attempted to enhance honeybee foraging by spraying\nscent compounds on orchard trees, but this approach was costly, had to be repeated, had\npotentially toxic effects on the soil or local biota, and, in the end, proved to be inefficient.\nThe poor effectiveness of this strategy probably reflects inherent limitations of the artificial,\ntopically applied compounds, which clearly fail to convey the appropriate message to the\nbees. For example, general spraying of the volatile mixture cannot tell the insects where\nexactly the blossoms are. Clearly, a more refined strategy is needed. The ability to\nenhance existing floral scent, which could all be accomplished by genetic engineering,\nwould allow us to manipulate the types of insect pollinators and the frequency of their visits.\nMoreover, the metabolic engineering of fragrance could increase crop protection against\npathogens and pests.\nF\nGenetic manipulation of the scent will also benefit the floriculture industry. Ornamentals,\nincluding cut flowers, foliage and potted plants, play an important aesthetic role in human\nlife. Unfortunately, traditional breeding has often produced cultivars with improved vase life,\nshipping characteristics, color and shape while sacrificing desirable perfumes. The loss of\nscent among ornamentals, which have a worldwide value of more than $30 billion, makes\nthem important targets for the genetic manipulation of flower fragrance. Some work has\nalready begun in this area, as several groups have created petunia and carnation plants\nthat express the linalool synthase gene from C. Breweri. These experiments are still\npreliminary: For technical reasons, the gene was expressed everywhere in the plant, and\nalthough the transgenic plants did create small amounts of linalool, the level was below the\nthreshold of detection for the human nose. Similar experiments in tobacco used genes for\nother monoterpene synthases, such as the one that produces limonene, but gave similar\nresults.\n \n2\n\nG\nThe next generation of experiments, already in progress, includes sophisticated schemes\nthat target the expression of scent genes specifically to flowers or other organs – such as\nspecial glands that can store antimicrobial or herbivore-repellent compounds.\n \n3",
