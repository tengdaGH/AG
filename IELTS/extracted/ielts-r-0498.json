  "passage_text": "Reading Practice\n \nThe iceman\nA. It was late spring or early summer. The man hurried through a forest he knew well,\nwincing from the pain in his injured right hand and pausing occasionally to listen for\nsounds that he was being pursued. As he fled up the slope, the yellow pollen of the\nhornbeam blossoms fell like an invisible rain, salting the water and food he consumed\nwhen he stopped to rest. Five thousand years later, the Neolithic hunter we call the\nIceman would still bear traces of this ancient dusting inside his body-a microscopic\nrecord of the time of year it was when he passed through this forest and into the\nnearby mountains, where fate would finally catch up with him.\nB. Since hikers discovered his mummified corpse in 1991 in a rocky hollow high in the\nOtztal Alps on Italy's border with Austria, scientists have used ever more\nsophisticated tools and intellectual cunning to reconstruct the life and times of the\nIceman, the oldest intact member of the human family. We know that he was a small,\nsinewy, and, for his times, rather elderly man in his mid-40s. Judging from the\nprecious, copper-bladed ax found with him, we suspect that he was a person of\nconsiderable social significance. He set off on his journey wearing three layers of\ngarments and sturdy shoes with bearskin soles. He was well equipped with a flint-\ntipped dagger, a little fire-starting kit, and a birchbark container holding embers\nwrapped in maple leaves. Yet he also headed into a harsh wilderness curiously\nunder-armed: The arrows in his deerskin quiver were only half finished, as if he had\nrecently fired all his munitions and was in the process of hastily replenishing them.\nAnd he was traveling with a long, roughly shaped stalk of yew-an unfinished longbow,\nyet to be notched and strung. Why?\nC. When it comes to the Iceman, there has never been a shortage of questions, or\ntheories to answer them. During the 16 years that scientists have poked, prodded,\nincised, and x-rayed his body, they have dressed him up in speculations that have\nnot worn nearly as well as his rustic garments. At one time or another, he has been\nmistakenly described as a lost shepherd, a shaman, a victim of ritual sacrifice, and\neven a vegan. But all these theories fade in the face of the most startling new fact\nscientists have learned about the Iceman. Although we still don't know exactly what\nhappened up there on that alpine ridge, we now know that he was murdered, and\ndied very quickly, in the rocky hollow where his body was found.\nD. \"Even five years ago, the story was that he fled up there and walked around in the\nsnow and probably died of exposure,\" said Klaus Oeggl, an archaeobotanist at the\nUniversity of Innsbruck. \"Now it's all changed.

The Iceman probably set off on his final journey from this very\narea, near where the modern-day Adige and Senales Rivers meet.\nF. We also know that he was not in good health when he headed up into the mountains.\nThe one surviving fingernail recovered from his remains suggests that he suffered\nthree episodes of significant disease during the last six months of life, the last bout\nonly two months prior to his death. Doctors inspecting the contents of his intestines\nhave found eggs of the whipworm parasite, so he may well have suffered from\nstomach distress. But he was not too sick to eat. In 2002, Franco Rollo and\ncolleagues at the University of Camerino in Italy analyzed tiny amounts of food\nresidue from the mummy's intestines. A day or two before his death, the Iceman had\neaten a piece of wild goat and some plant food.\nG. Archaeobotanists have used equally clever analyses of pollen and plant fragments to\nplot the Iceman's last movements. James Dickson of the University of Glasgow has\nidentified no less than 80 distinct species of mosses and liverworts in, on, or near the\nIceman's body. The most prominent moss, Neckera complanata, still grows at several\nsites in the valleys to the south, in some cases quite near known prehistoric sites.\nAccording to Dickson, a clot of stems found in the Iceman's possession suggests he\nwas probably using the moss to wrap food, although other ancient peoples used\nsimilar mosses as toilet paper.\nH.\nin the low-altitude deciduous forests to the south, in the springtime when the hop\nhornbeams were in bloom.

This suggests that he may have climbed\nto a higher altitude where pine trees grow in mixed coniferous forests, then\ndescended to the lower altitude of the hop hornbeams, and finally ascended again\ninto the pine forests in his last day or two.
