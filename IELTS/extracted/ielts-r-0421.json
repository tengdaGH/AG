  "passage_text": "Reading Practice\n \n \nTackling Obesity in the Western World\n \nA Obesity is a huge problem in many Western countries and one which now attracts\nconsiderable medical interest as researchers take up the challenge to find a 'cure' for the\ncommon condition of being seriously overweight. However, rather than take responsibility\nfor their weight, obese people have often sought solace in the excuse that they have a slow\nmetabolism, a genetic hiccup which sentences more than half the Australian population\n(63% of men and 47% of women) to a life of battling with their weight. The argument goes\nlike this: it doesn't matter how little they eat, they gain weight because their bodies break\ndown food and turn it into energy more slowly than those with a so-called normal metabolic\nrate.\n \nB 'This is nonsense,' says Dr Susan Jebb from the Dunn Nutrition Unit at Cambridge in\nEngland. Despite the persistence of this metabolism myth, science has known for several\nyears that the exact opposite is in fact true. Fat people have faster metabolisms than thin\npeople. 'What is very clear,' says Dr Jebb, 'is that overweight people actually burn off more\nenergy. They have more cells, bigger hearts, bigger lungs and they all need more energy\njust to keep going.'\n \nC It took only one night, spent in a sealed room at the Dunn Unit to disabuse one of\ntheir patients of the beliefs of a lifetime: her metabolism was fast, not slow. By\nsealing the room and measuring the exact amount of oxygen she used, researchers\nwere able to show her that her metabolism was not the culprit. It wasn't the answer\nshe expected and probably not the one she wanted but she took the news\nphilosophically.\n \n \nD Although the metabolism myth has been completely disproved, science has far from\ndiscounted our genes as responsible for making us whatever weight we are, fat or thin.\nOne of the world's leading obesity researchers, geneticist Professor Stephen O'Rahilly,\ngoes so far as to say we are on the threshold of a complete change in the way we view not\nonly morbid obesity, but also everyday overweight. Prof. O'Rahilly's groundbreaking work in\nCambridge has proven that obesity can be caused by our genes. 'These people are not\nweak- willed, slothful or lazy,' says Prof. O'Rahilly, 'They have a medical condition due to a\ngenetic defect and that causes them to be obese.'\n \nE In Australia, the University of Sydney's Professor Ian Caterson says while major genetic\ndefects may be rare, many people probably have minor genetic variations that combine to\ndictate weight and are responsible for things such as how much we eat, the amount of\nexercise we do and the amount of energy we need. When you add up all these little\nvariations, the result is that some people are genetically predisposed to putting on weight.\nHe says while the fast/slow metabolism debate may have been settled, that doesn't mean\nsome other subtle change in the metabolism gene won't be found in overweight people. He\nis confident that science will, eventually, be able to 'cure' some forms of obesity but the\nonly effective way for the vast majority of overweight and obese people to lose weight is a\nchange of diet and an increase in exercise.\nF Despite the $500 million a year Australians spend trying to lose weight and the $830\nmillion it costs the community in health care, obesity is at epidemic proportions here, as it is\nin all Western nations. Until recently, research and treatment for obesity had concentrated\non behaviour modification, drugs to decrease appetite and surgery. How the drugs worked\n \n1\n\n \nwas often not understood and many caused severe side effects and even death in some\npatients. Surgery for obesity has also claimed many lives.\n \nG It has long been known that a part of the brain called the hypothalamus is\nresponsible for regulating hunger, among other things. But it wasn't until 1994 that\nProfessor Jeffery Friedman from Rockerfeller University in the US sent science in a new\ndirection by studying an obese mouse. Prof. Friedman found that unlike its thin brothers,\nthe fat mouse did not produce a hitherto unknown hormone called leptin. Manufactured by\nthe fat cells, leptin acts as a messenger, sending signals to the hypothalamus to turn off the\nappetite. Previously, the fat cells were thought to be responsible simply for storing fat. Prof.\nFriedman gave the fat mouse leptin and it lost 30% of its body weight in two weeks.\nH On the other side of the Atlantic, Prof. O'Rahilly read about this research with great\nexcitement. For many months two blood samples had lain in the bottom of his freezer,\ntaken from two extremely obese young cousins. He hired a doctor to develop a test for\nleptin in human blood, which eventually resulted in the discovery that neither of the\nchildren's blood contained the hormone. When one cousin was given leptin, she lost a\nstone in weight and Prof. O'Rahilly made medical history. Here was the first proof that a\ngenetic defect could cause obesity in humans. But leptin deficiency turned out to be an\nextremely rare condition and there is a lot more research to be done before the 'magic' cure\nfor obesity is ever found.\n \n2",
