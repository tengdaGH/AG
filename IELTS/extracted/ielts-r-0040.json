  "passage_text": "Reading Practice\n \nArtists’ Fingerprints\nWorks of art often bear the fingerprints of the artist who created them. Such crucial\nevidence usually goes unnoticed even by connoisseurs, art experts, and conservators. If\npresent, such evidence could be valuable in clarifying questions about authorship and\ndating.\n \n{A} The unique character of ridges on our hands has been recognized for thousands of\nyears. The study of ancient pottery for example reveals the utilization of fingerprint\nimpressions in the clay as a maker’s mark. In prehistoric times, we find examples of\nhandprints in cave paintings. Only as recently as 1858 did Sir William Herschel establish its\nuse for identification. In 1888, Sir Francis Galton undertook to refine and formulate\nHerschel’s observations. Identification by fingerprint was first adopted in England in 1905\nand received general acceptance worldwide in 1908.\n{B} The combination of a number of characteristics in a given finger impression is specific\nto a particular print. The placing of reliance on fingerprint evidence has always been on the\nassumption that no two fingers can have identical ridge characteristics. Galton’s\nmathematical conclusions predicted the possible existence of some 64 billion different\nfingerprint patterns. The functionality of this technique is that the probability for the\nexistence of two identical finger impressions from different individuals is nil and no such\npossibility has ever been noticed in any part of the world at any time.\n{C} The individuality of a fingerprint is not determined by its general shape or pattern but by\nthe careful study of its ridge characteristics. Since at a scene of the crime, usually only\npartial prints are found, comparison of a relatively small number of characteristics is\naccepted in legal practice. In a judicial proceeding, a point-by-point comparison must be\ndemonstrated by the fingerprint expert. This is exactly the principle that must be followed in\nart-related fingerprint issues. \n \n{D} Artists in the area of the visual arts use their hands for creation. Their tools, such as\nbrushes often isolate them from the surface they are working on. Inaccurate deposits of\npaint are often corrected by modelling with the fingertip. Some artists used the fingertip to\nsoften the marks left by the brush by gently tapping or stroking the still wet surface. In\nsome instances, the fingertip was used for literally ‘stamping’ the fine network of ridges\nonto the painting.\n{E} The eventual authentication of a painting by J. M. W. Turner entitled Landscape with\nRainbow in 1993 is a good illustration of the process. The painting was discovered in the\nearly 1980s. Biros took the painting to the Tate Gallery, in London, to show it to the world’s\nleading Turner experts and connoisseurs. The verdict was unanimous – the painting was a\ntattered imitation. However, fingerprint evidence was discovered on the painting during\nrestoration, appropriately documented, and re-examined by a veteran expert from the\nRCMP. A match was found between a fingerprint on “Landscape with Rainbow and\nfingerprints photographed on another Turner painting, ‘Chichester Canal’. When an\nindependent fingerprint examination by John Manners of the West\nYorkshire Police confirmed the conclusions that the fingerprints on both paintings were\n \n1\n\nidentical, the unbelievers changed their minds. In addition, it is well known that Turner\nalways worked alone and had no assistants. This reduces the chances of accidental\ncontribution substantially. The painting, originally bought for a few hundred dollars, finally\nsold for close to $200,000 at auction at Phillips in London in 1995.\n{F} In 1998, three envelopes containing old correspondence had been purchased in an\nantique shop. One of the envelopes postmarked April 2, 1915, was found to contain a\ndrawing folded in half. The drawing depicts a woman’s head. It is executed in red chalk with\nan inscription written in reverse with brown ink. The design is faded and worn. Some spots\nsuggest foxing and subsequent discolouration. The paper is yellowed and contaminated.\n \n{G} The newly discovered design bears great similarity to that of the Head of St Anne by\nLeonardo da Vinci, (RL 12533) in the Windsor Collection since 1629. The medium is\ndifferent, red chalk being used instead of black. The scale of the two images is different so\noffsetting (copying by contact transference) is not a satisfactory explanation for the new\ndrawing. When the paper was first examined, several fingerprints were noticed on the\nverso. One of them was found clear and containing many ridges suitable for comparison,\nhowever, no analysis was done at the time due to the lack of reference material. Many of\nLeonardo’s works are not easily accessible and fingerprint data either does not exist or is\nnot published.\n{H} By chance, on March 30, 1999, several clear and usable fingerprints were found on an\nunusually good detail photo in a publication on Leonardo. The photograph of Leonardo’s St\nJerome, in the Vatican Museum, revealed no less than 16 partial fingertip marks. The\nimportance of this is that the fingerprints are left in the still-wet paint and without doubt, the\nuse of the fingertip served to model paint. Since the authorship of the painting of St Jerome\nis unquestioned by scholarship and has always been ascribed to Leonardo, the conclusion\nthat these fingerprints are his would be hard to argue against.\n \n{I} The fingerprints on the St Jerome illustration were scanned and enlarged so\ncomparisons could be made with the fingerprint on the newly discovered drawing. One of\nthem proved to match. The result of our analyses was presented on March 31, 1999, to\nfingerprint examiner Staff Sergeant André Turcotte for an independent assessment. He\nagreed with the findings and confirmed the conclusion. The fingerprint on the St Jerome\npainting in the Vatican and the newly discovered drawing were created by the same finger.\n{J] Remember, the authentication approach should rest on strict considerations and\nrigorous methodology. Only prints that are clearly from the original creative process are\nadmitted for consideration. The reference samples should ideally come from unquestioned\nworks of art with good provenance. Spurious contributors must be eliminated such as\nassistants who may have touched the painting while still wet. A match is never made\nunless corroborated by at least one fully trained and experienced fingerprint examiner.\n \n2",
