  "passage_text": "Reading Practice\n \n \n \nRecovering a damaged reputation\nIn 2009, it was revealed that some of the information published by the University of East\nAnglia’s Climatic Research Unit (CRU) in the UK, concerning climate change, had been\ninaccurate. Furthermore, it was alleged that some of the relevant statistics had been\nwithheld from publication. The ensuing controversy affected the reputation not only of that\ninstitution, but also of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), with which\nthe CRU is closely involved, and of climate scientists in general. Even if the claims of\nmisconduct and incompetence were eventually proven to be largely untrue, or confined to a\nfew individuals, the damage was done. The perceived wrongdoings of a few people had\nraised doubts about the many.\nThe response of most climate scientists was to cross their fingers and hope for the best,\nand they kept a low profile. Many no doubt hoped that subsequent independent inquiries\ninto the IPCC and CRU would draw a line under their problems. However, although these\nwere likely to help, they were unlikely to undo the harm caused by months of hostile news\nreports and attacks by critics.\nThe damage that has been done should not be underestimated. As Ralph Cicerone, the\nPresident of the US National Academy of Sciences, wrote in an editorial in the journal\nScience: ‘Public opinion has moved toward the view that scientists often try to suppress\nalternative hypotheses and ideas and that scientists will withhold data and try to manipulate\nsome aspects of peer review to prevent dissent.’ He concluded that ‘the perceived\nmisbehavior of even a few scientists can diminish the credibility of science as a whole.’\nAn opinion poll taken at the beginning of 2010 found that the proportion of people in the US\nwho trust scientists as a source of information about global warming had dropped from 83\npercent, in 2008, to 74 percent. Another survey carried out by the British Broadcasting\nCorporation in February 2010 found that just 26 percent of British people now believe that\nclimate change is confirmed as being largely human-made, down from 41 percent in\nNovember 2009.\n \n \nRegaining the confidence and trust of the public is never easy. Hunkering down and hoping\nfor the best - climate science’s current strategy - makes it almost impossible. It is much\nbetter to learn from the successes and failures of organisations that have dealt with similar\nblows to their public standing.\nIn fact, climate science needs professional help to rebuild its reputation. It could do worse\nthan follow the advice given by Leslie Gaines-Ross, a ‘reputation strategist’ at Public\nRelations (PR) company Webef Shandwick, in her recent book Corporate Reputation: 12\nSteps to Safeguarding and Recovering Reputation. Gaines-Ross’s strategy is based on her\nanalysis of how various organisations responded to crises, such as desktop-printer firm\nXerox, whose business plummeted during the 1990s, and the USA’s National Aeronautics\nand Space Administration (NASA) after the Columbia shuttle disaster in 2003.\nThe first step she suggests is to ‘take the heat - leader first’. In many cases, chief\nexecutives who publicly accept responsibility for corporate failings can begin to reverse the\nfreefall of their company’s reputations, but not always. If the leader is held at least partly\nresponsible for the fall from grace, it can be almost impossible to convince critics that a\nnew direction can be charted with that same person at the helm.\n \n1\n\nThis is the dilemma facing the heads of the IPCC and CRU. Both have been blamed for\ntheir organisations’ problems, not least for the way in which they have dealt with critics, and\nboth have been subjected to public calls for their removal. Yet both organisations appear to\nbelieve they can repair their reputations without a change of leadership.\nThe second step outlined by Gaines-Ross is to ‘communicate tirelessly’. Yet many climate\nresearchers have avoided the media and the public, at least until the official enquiries have\nconcluded their reports. This reaction may be understandable, but it has backfired.\nJournalists following the story have often been unable to find spokespeople willing to\ndefend climate science. In this case, ‘no comment’ is commonly interpreted as an\nadmission of silent, collective guilt.\n \n \nRemaining visible is only a start, though; climate scientists also need to be careful what\nthey say. They must realise that they face doubts not just about their published results, but\nalso about their conduct and honesty. It simply won’t work for scientists to continue to\nappeal to the weight of the evidence, while refusing to discuss the integrity of their\nprofession. The harm has been increased by a perceived reluctance to admit even the\npossibility of mistakes or wrongdoing.\nThe third step put forward by Gaines-Ross is ‘don’t underestimate your critics and\ncompetitors’. This means not only recognising the skill with which the opponents of climate\nresearch have executed their campaigns through Internet blogs and other media, but also\nacknowledging the validity of some of their criticisms. It is clear, for instance, that climate\nscientists need better standards of transparency, to allow for scrutiny not just by their\npeers, but also by critics from outside the world of research.\n \n \nIt is also important to engage with those critics. That doesn’t mean conceding to unfounded\narguments which are based on prejudice rather than evidence, but there is an obligation to\nhelp the public understand the causes of climate change, as well as the options for\navoiding and dealing with the consequences.\nTo begin the process of rebuilding trust in their profession, climate scientists need to follow\nthese three seeps. But that is just the start. Gaines-Ross estimates that it typically takes\nfour years for a company to rescue and restore a broken reputation.\nWinning back public confidence is a marathon, not a sprint, but you can’t win at all if you\ndon’t step up to the starting line.\n \n2",
