  "passage_text": "Reading Practice\n \nThe Benefits of Being Bilingual\nA\nAccording to the latest figures, the majority of the world’s population is now bilingual or\nmultilingual, having grown up speaking two or more languages. In the past, such children\nwere considered to be at a disadvantage compared with their monolingual peers. Over the\npast few decades, however, technological advances have allowed researchers to look\nmore deeply at how bilingualism interacts with and changes the cognitive and neurological\nsystems, thereby identifying several clear benefits of being bilingual.\nB\nResearch shows that when a bilingual person uses one language, the other is active at the\nsame time. When we hear a word, we don’t hear the entire word all at once: the sounds\narrive in sequential order. Long before the word is finished, the brain’s language system\nbegins to guess what that word might be. If you hear ‘can’, you will likely activate words like\n‘candy’ and ‘candle’ as well, at least during the earlier stages of word recognition. For\nbilingual people, this activation is not limited to a single language; auditory input activates\ncorresponding words regardless of the language to which they belong. Some of the most\ncompelling evidence for this phenomenon, called ‘language co-activation’, comes from\nstudying eye movements. A Russian-English bilingual asked to ‘pick up a marker’ from a\nset of objects would look more at a stamp than someone who doesn’t know Russian,\nbecause the Russian word for ‘stamp’, marka, sounds like the English word he or she\nheard, ‘marker’. In cases like this, language co-activation occurs because what the listener\nhears could map onto words in either language.\nC\nHaving to deal with this persistent linguistic competition can result in difficulties, however.\nFor instance, knowing more than one language can cause speakers to name pictures more\nslowly, and can increase ‘tip-of-the-tongue states’, when you can almost, but not quite,\nbring a word to mind. As a result, the constant juggling of two languages creates a need to\ncontrol how much a person accesses a language at any given time. For this reason,\nbilingual people often perform better on tasks that require conflict management. In the\nclassic Stroop Task, people see a word and are asked to name the colour of the word’s\nfont. When the colour and the word match (i., the word ‘red’ printed in red), people correctly\nname the colour more quickly than when the colour and the word don’t match (i., the word\n‘red’ printed in blue). This occurs because the word itself (‘red’) and its font colour (blue)\nconflict. Bilingual people often excel at tasks such as this, which tap into the ability to\nignore competing perceptual information and focus on the relevant aspects of the input.\nBilinguals are also better at switching between two tasks; for example, when bilinguals\nhave to switch from categorizing objects by colour (red or green) to categorizing them by\nshape (circle or triangle), they do so more quickly than monolingual people, reflecting better\ncognitive control when having to make rapid changes of strategy.\nD\nIt also seems that the neurological roots of the bilingual advantage extend to brain areas\n \n1\n\nmore traditionally associated with sensory processing. When monolingual and bilingual\nadolescents listen to simple speech sounds without any intervening background noise, they\nshow highly similar brain stem responses. When researchers play the same sound to both\ngroups in the presence of background noise, however, the bilingual listeners’ neural\nresponse is considerably larger, reflecting better encoding of the sound’s fundamental\nfrequency, a feature of sound closely related to pitch perception.\nE\nSuch improvements in cognitive and sensory processing may help a bilingual person to\nprocess information in the environment, and help explain why bilingual adults acquire a\nthird language better than monolingual adults master a second language. This advantage\nmay be rooted in the skill of focussing on information about the new language while\nreducing interference from the languages they already know.\nF\nResearch also indicates that bilingual experience may help to keep the cognitive\nmechanisms sharp by recruiting alternate brain networks to compensate for those that\nbecome damaged during aging. Older bilinguals enjoy improved memory relative to\nmonolingual people, which can lead to real-world health benefits. In a study of over 200\npatients with Alzheimer’s disease, a degenerative brain disease, bilingual patients reported\nshowing initial symptoms of the disease an average of five years later than monolingual\npatients. In a follow-up study, researchers compared the brains of bilingual and\nmonolingual patients matched on the severity of Alzheimer’s symptoms. Surprisingly, the\nbilinguals’ brains had more physical signs of disease than their monolingual counterparts,\neven though their outward behaviour and abilities were the same. If the brain is an engine,\nbilingualism may help it to go farther on the same amount of fuel.\nG\nFurthermore, the benefits associated with bilingual experience seem to start very early. In\none study, researchers taught seven-month-old babies growing up in monolingual or\nbilingual homes that when they heard a tinkling sound, a puppet appeared on one side of a\nscreen. Halfway through the study, the puppet began appearing on the opposite side of the\nscreen. In order to get a reward, the infants had to adjust the rule they’d learned; only the\nbilingual babies were able to successfully learn the new rule. This suggests that for very\nyoung children, as well as for older people, navigating a multilingual environment imparts\nadvantages that transfer far beyond language.\n \n2",
