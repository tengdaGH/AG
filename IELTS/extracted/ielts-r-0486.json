  "passage_text": "Reading Practice\n \nThe History of building Telegraph lines\nA\nThe idea of electrical communication seems to have begun as long ago as 1746 when\nabout 200 monks at a monastery in Paris arranged themselves in a line over a mile long,\neach holding ends of 25 ft iron wires. The abbot, also a scientist, discharged a primitive\nelectrical battery into the wire, giving all the monks a simultaneous electrical shock. “This\nall sounds very silly, but is in fact extremely important because, firstly, they all said ‘ow’\nwhich showed that you were sending a signal right along the line; and, secondly, they all\nsaid ‘ow’ at the same time, and that meant that you were sending the signal very quickly,\n“explains Tom Standage, author of the Victorian Internet and technology editor at the\nEconomist. Given a more humane detection system, this could be a way of signaling over\nlong distances.\nB\nWith wars in Europe and colonies beyond, such a signaling system was urgently needed.\nAll sorts of electrical possibilities were proposed, some of them quite ridiculous. Two\nEnglishmen, William Cooke and Charles Wheatstone came up with a system in which dials\nwere made to point at different letters, but that involved five wires and would have been\nexpensive to construct.\nC\nMuch simpler was that of an American, Samuel Morse, whose system only required a\nsingle wire to send a code of dots and dashes. At first, it was imagined that only a few\nhighly skilled encoders would be able to use it but it soon became clear that many people\ncould become proficient in Morse code.
