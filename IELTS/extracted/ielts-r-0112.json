  "passage_text": "Reading Practice\n \nCoral reefs\nCoral reefs are underwater structures made from calcium carbonate secreted by corals.\nCoral reefs are colonies of tiny living animals found in marine waters that contain few\nnutrients. Most coral reefs are built from stony corals, which in turn consist of polyps that\ncluster in groups.\nA\nCoral reefs are estimated to cover 284,300 km2 just under 0.1% of the oceans‘ surface\narea, about half the area of France. The Indo-Pacific region accounts for 91.9% of this total\narea. Southeast Asia accounts for 32.3% of that figure, while the Pacific including Australia\naccounts for 40.8%. Atlantic and Caribbean coral reefs account for 7.6%. Yet often called\nrainforests of the sea, coral reefs form some of the most diverse ecosystems on Earth.\nThey provide a home for 25% of all marine species, including fish, mollusks worms,\ncrustaceans, echinoderms, sponges, tunicates and other cnidarians. Paradoxically, coral\nreefs flourish even though they are surrounded by ocean waters that provide few nutrients.\nThey are most commonly found at shallow depths in tropical waters, but deep water and\ncold water corals also exist on smaller scales in other areas. Although corals exist both in\ntemperate and tropical waters, shallow-water reefs form only in a zone extending from\n30°N to 30°S of the equator. Deepwater coral can exist at greater depths and colder\ntemperatures at much higher latitudes, as far north as Norway. Coral reefs are rare along\nthe American and African west coasts. This is due primarily to upwelling and strong cold\ncoastal currents that reduce water temperatures in these areas (respectively the Peru,\nBenguela and Canary streams). Corals are seldom found along the coastline of South Asia\nfrom the eastern tip of India (Madras) to the Bangladesh and Myanmar borders. They are\nalso rare along the coast around northeastern South America and Bangladesh due to the\nfreshwater released from the Amazon and Ganges Rivers, respectively.\nB\nCoral reefs deliver ecosystem services to tourism, fisheries and coastline protection. The\nglobal economic value of coral reefs has been estimated at as much as $US375 billion per\nyear. Coral reefs protect shorelines by absorbing wave energy, and many small islands\nwould not exist without their reef to protect them.\nC\nThe value of reefs in biodiverse regions can be even higher. In parts of Indonesia and the\nCaribbean where tourism is the main use, reefs are estimated to be worth US$1 million per\nsquare kilometer, based on the cost of maintaining sandy beaches and the value of\nattracting snorkelers and scuba divers. Meanwhile, a recent study of the Great Barrier Reef\nin Australia found that the reef is worth more to the country as an intact ecosystem than an\nextractive reserve for fishing. Each year more than 1.8 million tourists visit the reef,\nspending an estimated AU$4.3 billion (Australian dollars) on reef-related industries from\ndiving to boat rental to posh island resort stays. In the Caribbean, says UNEP, the net\nannual benefits from diver tourism were US$2 billion in 2000 with US$625 million spent\ndirectly on diving on reefs. Further, reef tourism is an important source of employment,\nespecially for some of the world‘s poorest people. UNEP says that of the estimated 30\nmillion small-scale fishers in the developing world, most are dependent to a greater or\n \n1\n\nlesser extent on coral reefs. In the Philippines, for example, more than one million small-\nscale fishers depend directly on coral reefs for their livelihoods. The report estimates that\nreef fisheries were worth between $15,000 and $150,000 per square kilometer a year,\nwhile fish caught for aquariums were worth $500 a kilogram against $6 for fish caught as\nfood. The aquarium fish export industry supports around 50,000 people and generates\nsome US$5.5 million a year in Sri Lanka along.\nD\nUnfortunately, coral reefs are dying around the world. In particular, coral mining,\nagricultural and urban runoff, pollution (organic and inorganic), disease, and the digging of\ncanals and access into islands and bays are localized threats to coral ecosystems. Broader\nthreats are sea temperature rise, sea-level rise and pH changes from ocean acidification,\nall associated with greenhouse gas emissions. Some current fishing practices are\ndestructive and unsustainable. These include cyanide fishing, overfishing and blast fishing.\nAlthough cyanide fishing supplies live reef fish for the tropical aquarium market, most fish\ncaught using this method are sold in restaurants, primarily in Asia, where live fish are\nprized for their freshness. To catch fish with cyanide, fishers dive down to the reef and\nsquirt cyanide in coral crevices and on the fast-moving fish, to stun the fish making them\neasy to catch. Overfishing is another leading cause for coral reef degradation. Often, too\nmany fish are taken from one reef to sustain a population in that area. Poor fishing\npractices, such as banging on the reef with sticks (muro-ami), destroy coral formations that\nnormally function as fish habitat. In some instances, people fish with explosives (blast\nfishing), which blast apart the surrounding coral.\nE\nTourist resorts that empty their sewage directly into the water surrounding coral reefs\ncontribute to coral reef degradation. Wastes kept in poorly maintained septic tanks can also\nleak into surrounding groundwater, eventually seeping out to the reefs. Careless boating,\ndiving, snorkeling and fishing can also damage coral reefs. Whenever people grab, kick,\nand walk on, or stir up sediment in the reefs, they contribute to coral reef destruction.\nCorals are also harmed or killed when people drop anchors on them or when people collect\ncoral.\nF\nTo find answers for these problems, scientists and researchers study the various factors\nthat impact reefs. The list includes the ocean‘s role as a carbon dioxide sink, atmospheric\nchanges, ultraviolet light, ocean acidification, viruses, impacts of dust storms carrying\nagents to far-flung reefs, pollutants, algal blooms and others. Reefs are threatened well\nbeyond coastal areas. General estimates show approximately 10% of the worlds coral\nreefs are dead. About 60% of the world‘s reefs are at risk due to destructive, human-related\nactivities. The threat to the health of reefs is particularly strong in Southeast Asia, where\n80% of reefs are endangered.\nG\nIn Australia, the Great Barrier Reef is protected by the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park\nAuthority and is the subject of much legislation, including a biodiversity action plan.\nInhabitants of Ahus Island, Manus Province, Papua New Guinea, have followed a\ngenerations-old practice of restricting fishing in six areas of their reef lagoon. Their cultural\n \n2\n\ntraditions allow line fishing, but not net or spearfishing.
