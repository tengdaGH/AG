  "passage_text": "Reading Practice\n \nCrows Can be Craftsmen too\nA remarkable colony of inventors has emerged on an isolated Pacific island.They can\nfashion tools out of materials scavenged from the rainforest. They can even customise a\ntool for a given job. Meet the crows of New Caledonia.\nThinkers as diverse as Freud, Engels and Thomas Carlyle once pointed to the use of tools\nas being a defining behaviour of human beings. Then it was found that many animals also\nused them, from the’fishing sticks’of apes to the rocks dropped on ostrich eggs by Egyptian\nvultures. Crows are particularly crafty. Earlier studies showed that they are almost human-\nlike in their use of tools, with technological features that match the stone and bone tool\ncultures that emerged among primitive humans between 2.5 million and 70,000 BC.\nBut only humans were thought to have the brain power required for cumulative\ntechnological evolution. This is the skill for innovation that took our ancestors two million\nyears ago from creating flakes of flint, for use in cutting, to honing knives, blades,\narrowheads and axeheads.\nNow this ‘unique’ attribute of humans has also turned out to be a flattering delusion. A new\nstudy shows that the crows of New Caledonia are inventive. With their evolving leaf tools,\nthe birds have levered man off his pedestal.\nDr Gavin Hunt and Dr Russell Gray of the University of Auckland have spent the past\ndecade studying feathered technology in New Caledonia, 900 miles north-east of Australia.\nAfter an intensive field survey of local crow industry, the scientists found that the birds rip\nthe leaves of the pandanus tree to fashion three distinct types of tool for grub and insect\nextraction: wide, narrow and tapered.\nLong ago, the birds discovered that they could rip the serrated edge off the leaves to make\na wide tool. The skill spread and the crows honed tools with finer working tips, by either\nnarrowing tools or tapering them. (Because the leaves are reinforced by tough parallel\nfibres, the tapered design is made in steps. The crow nips the leaf, rips along the fibres,\nmakes another cut and tears again, repeating until it has a tool with usually two, three or\nfour steps.)\nLeaf tool manufacture is an example of culture: the birds leam through example and their\ntool-making wisdom grows in sophistication down the generations. The crows appear to\nhave the cognitive requirements for cumulative, though rudimentary, technological\nevolution, said Dr Gray. Tool manufacture in New Caledonian crows shows striking\nflexibility and innovation.’ The ability of the birds to innovate is further shown by their\nmaking of other tools. They often strip a twig of leaves and cut it off just below a shortened\noffshoot to create a hook to get bugs out. They also use simpler tools to extract grubs from\nthe dead wood of trees.\nProf Alex Kacelnik, fellow of Pembroke College, Oxford, praised the study as’extremely\nimportant’. It complements his own research, with Dr Jackie Chappell and Alex Weir, which\nhas turned Betty the New Caledonian crow into a star by revealing her to be the first\nanimal, other than man, to show a basic understanding of cause and effect.\nBetty began making tools after her partner snatched away a hook made for her by the\nresearchers, forcing her to make her own from garden wire to fish out morsels from a tube.\n \n1\n\nShe wedged the end of the wire into the base of the food tube and turned her head to form\nthe hook. What amazed the researchers is that she can even adapt her hooks if they are\nnot up to the job, something that even chimpanzees are unable to do. Although chimps use\nsticks in experiments, they have not shown any human-like understanding of basic physical\nlaws.’When she starts bending the wire it is as if she has a clear objective, even correcting\nthe angle of the hook if it is not right,’ said Prof Kacelnik.’Although many animals use tools,\npurposeful modification of objects to solve new problems, without training or prior\nexperience, is virtually unknown.’\n‘While we have been emphasising the individual ability of animals like Betty to solve\nproblems, the New Zealand team has been emphasising tool manufacture, the cultural\ntraditions and transmission of information in the wild,’ said Prof Kacelnik. Both strands of\nresearch are related by how the crows are not genetically programmed to use a tool, like a\nspider and his web. Instead, the birds creatively invent new kinds of tools to solve problems\nand can share skills with others.\nThe crow family are the Einsteins of the avian world, though Prof Kacelnik added that, at\nleast in terms of tool making, the Pacific crows are smarter than their British cousins. We\nhave not yet identified what it is that makes these crows so special, though it is something\nto do with ecological circumstances,’said Prof Kacelnik.\nOnce scientists have got to the bottom of what makes Pacific crows master toolmakers,\nthey may have to think again about how this skill evolved in humans.\n \n2",
