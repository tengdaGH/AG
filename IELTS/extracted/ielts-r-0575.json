Whilst the rural countryside has become poorer and poorer, wildlife habitat in towns\nhas burgeoned. Now, if you want to hear a deafening dawn chorus of birds or familiarise\nyourself with foxes, you can head for the urban forest.\nWhilst species that depend on wide open spaces such as the hare, the eagle and the red\ndeer may still be restricted to remote rural landscapes, many of our wild plants and animals\nfind the urban ecosystem ideal. This really should be no surprise, since it is the\nfragmentation and agrochemical pollution in the farming lowlands that has led to the\ncatastrophic decline of so many species.\nBy contrast, most urban open spaces have escaped the worst of the pesticide revolution,\nand they are an intimate mosaic of interconnected habitats. Over the years, the cutting\ndown of hedgerows on farmland has contributed to habitat isolation and species loss. In\ntowns, the tangle of canals, railway embankments, road verges and boundary hedges lace\nthe landscape together, providing first-class ecological corridors for species such as\nhedgehogs, kingfishers and dragonflies.\nUrban parks and formal recreation grounds are valuable for some species, and many of\nthem are increasingly managed with wildlife in mind. But in many places their significance\nis eclipsed by the huge legacy of post-industrial land demolished factories, waste tips,\nquarries, redundant railway yards and other so-called ‘brownfield’ sites. In Merseyside,\nSouth Yorkshire and the West Midlands, much of this has been spectacularly colonised\nwith birch and willow woodland, herb-rich grassland and shallow wetlands. As a\nconsequence, there are song birds and predators in abundance over these once-industrial\nlandscapes.\nThere are fifteen million domestic gardens in the UK. and whilst some are still managed as\nlifeless chemical war zones, most benefit the local wildlife, either through benign neglect or\npositive encouragement. Those that do best tend to be woodland species, and the garden\nlawns and flower borders, climber-covered fences, shrubberies and fruit trees are a\nplausible alternative. Indeed, in some respects gardens are rather better than the real\nthing, especially with exotic flowers extending the nectar season. Birdfeeders can also\nsupplement the natural seed supply, and only the millions of domestic cats may spoil the\nscene.\nAs Britain’s gardeners have embraced the idea of ‘gardening with nature’, wildlife’s\nresponse has been spectacular. Between 1990 and the year 2000. the number of different\nbird species seen at artificial feeders in gardens increased from 17 to an amazing 81. The\nBUGS project (Biodiversity in Urban Gardens in Sheffield) calculates that there are 25.000\ngarden ponds and 100.000 nest boxes in that one city alone.\nWe are at last acknowledging that the wildlife habitat in towns provides a valuable life\nsupport system. The canopy of the urban forest is filtering air pollution, and intercepting\n \n1\n\nrainstorms, allowing the water to drip more gradually to the ground. Sustainable urban\ndrainage relies on ponds and wetlands to contain storm water runoff, thus reducing the risk\nof flooding, whilst reed beds and other wetland wildlife communities also help to clean up\nthe water. We now have scientific proof that contact with wildlife close to home can help to\nreduce stress and anger. Hospital patients with a view of natural green space make a more\nrapid recovery and suffer less pain.\nTraditionally, nature conservation in the UK has been seen as marginal and largely rural.\nNow we are beginning to place it at the heart of urban environmental and economic policy.\nThere are now dozens of schemes to create new habitats and restore old ones in and\naround our big cities. Biodiversity is big in parts of London. thanks to schemes such as the\nLondon Wetland Centre in the south west of the city.\nThis is a unique scheme masterminded by the Wildfowl and Wetlands Trust to create a\nwildlife reserve out of a redundant Victorian reservoir. Within five years of its creation the\nCentre has been hailed as one of the top sites for nature in England and made a Site of\nSpecial Scientific Interest. It consists of a 105-acre wetland site, which is made up of\ndifferent wetland habitats of shallow, open water and grazing marsh. The site attracts more\nthan 104 species of bird, including nationally important rarities like the bittern.\nWe need to remember that if we work with wildlife, then wildlife will work for us and this is\nthe very essence of sustainable development.\n \n2",
