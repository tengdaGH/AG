  "passage_text": "Reading Practice\n \nInsect decision-making\nIt has long been held that decision made collectively by large groups of people are more\nlikely to turn out to be accurate than decisions made by individuals. The idea goes back to\nthe 'jury theorem’ of Nicolas de Condorcet, an 18th-century French philosopher who was\none of the first to apply mathematics to the social sciences. Condorcet’s theory describes\ncollective decisions, outlining how democratic decisions tend to outperform dictatorial ones.\nIf, for example, each member of a jury has only partial information ,the majority decision is\nmore likely to be correct than a decision arrived at by a single juror. Moreover, the\nprobability of a correct decision increases with the size of the jury.\nNow it is becoming clear that group decisions are also extremely valuable for the success\nof social animals, such as ants ,bees .birds and dolphins .Bees make collective decisions\n,and they do it rather well, according to Christian List of the London School of Economics\n,who has studied group decision-making in humans and animals. Researchers led by Dr\nList looked at colonies once the original colony reaches a certain size. The queen goes off\nwith about two-thirds of the worker bees to live in a new home or nest, leaving a daughter\nqueen in the old nest with the remaining workers. Among the bees that depart are some\nthat have searched for and found some new nest sites, and reported back using a\ncharacteristic body movement known as a 'waggle dance' to indicate to the other bees the\nsuitable places they have located. The longer the dance, the better the site. After a while,\nother bees start to visit the sites signaled by their companions to see for themselves and,\non their return, also perform more waggle dances. The process eventually leads to a\nconsensus on the best site and the breakaway swarm migrates. The decision is remarkably\nreliable ,with the bees choosing the best site even when there are only small difference\nbetween alternative sites.\nBut exactly how do bees reach such a robust consensus? To find out ,Dr List and his\ncolleagues used a computer generated model of the decision-making process. By\nexperimenting with it they found that, when bees in the model were very good at finding\nnesting sites but did not share their information, this dramatically slowed down the\nmigration .leaving the swarm homelss and vulnerable .Conversely .bees in the model\nblindly following the waggle dances of others without first checking. The researchers\nconcluded that the ability of bees to identify successfully and quickly the best site depends\non both the bees ‘interdependence in communicating the whereabouts of the bees site, and\ntheir independence in confirming this information for themselves.\nAnother situation in which collective decisions are taken occurs when animals are either\nisolated from crucial sources of information or dominated by other members of the group.\nJosé Halloy of the Free University of Brussels in Belgium used robotic cockroaches to\nsubvert the behaviour of living cockroaches and control their decision-making process. In\nhis experiment, the artificial bugs were introduced to the live ones and soon became\nsufficiently socially integrated that they were perceived by the real cockroaches as equals.\nBy manipulating the robots, which were in the minority, Halloy was able to persuade the\nliving cockroaches to choose an inappropriate shelter-even one which they had rejected\nbefore being infiltrated by the robots.\nThe way insects put into effect collective decisions can be complex and as important as the\ndecisions themselves .At the University of Bristol, in the UK, Nigel Franks and his\n \n1\n\ncolleagues studied how a species of ant establishes a new nest. Franks and his associates\nreported how the insects reduce the problems associated with making a necessarily swift\nchoice. If the ants’ existing nest become suddenly threatened, the insects choose certain\nants to act as scouts to find a new nest.\n \n \nHow quickly they accomplish the transfer to a new home depends not only on how soon\nthe best available site is found, but also on how quickly the migration there can be\nachieved.\nOnce the suitable new nest is identified , the chosen ants begin to lead others , which have\nmade it to the new site or which may simply be in the vicinity, back to the original\nthreatened nest. In this way, those ants which are familiar with the route can help transport\n,for example ,the queen and young ants to the new site, and simultaneously show the way\nto those ants which have been left behind to guard the old nest. In this way moving\nprocesses are accomplished faster and more efficiently. Thus the dynamics of collective\ndecision-making are closely related to the efficient implementation of those decisions .How\nthis might apply to choices that humans make is , as yet,unclear. But it does suggest, even\nfor humans ,the importance of recruiting dynamic leaders to a cause,because the most\nimportant thing about collective decision-making ,as shown by these insect experiments, is\nto get others to follow.\n \n2",
