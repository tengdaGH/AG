  "passage_text": "Reading Practice\n \nAlfred Nobel: The man behind the Nobel Prize\nA\nSince 1901, the Nobel Prize has been honoring men and women from all corners of the\nglobe for outstanding achievements in physics, chemistry, medicine, literature, and for work\nin peace. The foundations for the prize were laid in 1895 when Alfred Nobel wrote his last\nwill, leaving much of his wealth to the establishment of the Nobel Prize.\nB\nAlfred Nobel was born in Stockholm on October 21, 1833. His father Immanuel Nobel was\nan engineer and inventor who built bridges and buildings in Stockholm. In connection with\nhis construction work, Immanuel Nobel also experimented with different techniques for\nblasting rocks. Successful in his industrial and business ventures, Immanuel Nobel was\nable, in 1842, to bring his family to St. Petersburg. There, his sons were given a first-class\neducation by private teachers. The training included natural sciences, languages and\nliterature. By the age of 17, Alfred Nobel was fluent in Swedish, Russian, French, English\nand German. His primary interests were in English literature and poetry as well as in\nchemistry and physics. Alfred’s father, who wanted his sons to join his enterprise as\nengineers, disliked Alfred’s interest in poetry and found his son rather introverted.\nC\nIn order to widen Alfred’s horizons, his father sent him abroad for further training in\nchemical engineering. During a two year period, Alfred Nobel visited Sweden, Germany,\nFrance and the United States. In Paris, the city he came to like best, he worked in the\nprivate laboratory of Professor T. J. Pclouze, a famous chemist. There he met the young\nItalian chemist Ascanio Sobrero who, three years earlier, had invented nitroglycerine, a\nhighly explosive liquid. But it was considered too dangerous to be of any practical use.\nAlthough its explosive power greatly exceeded that of gunpowder, the liquid would explode\nin a very unpredictable manner if subjected to heat and pressure. Alfred Nobel became\nvery interested in nitroglycerine and how it could be put to practical use in construction\nwork. He also realized that the safety problems had to be solved and a method had to be\ndeveloped for the controlled detonation of nitroglycerine.\nD\nAfter his return to Sweden in 1863, Alfred Nobel concentrated on developing nitroglycerine\nas an explosive. Several explosions, including one (1864) in which his brother Emil and\nseveral other persons were killed, convinced the authorities that nitroglycerine production\nwas exceedingly dangerous. They forbade further experimentation with nitroglycerine\nwithin the Stockholm city limits and Alfred Nobel had to move his experimentation to a\nbarge anchored on Lake Malaren. Alfred was not discouraged and in 1864 he was able to\nstart mass production of nitroglycerine. To make the handling of nitroglycerine safer Alfred\nNobel experimented with different additives. He soon found that mixing nitroglycerine with\nkieselguhr would turn the liquid into a paste which could be shaped into rods of a size and\nform suitable for insertion into drilling holes. In 1867 he patented this material under the\nname of dynamite. To be able to detonate the dynamite rods he also invented a detonator\n(blasting cap) which could be ignited by lighting a fuse. These inventions were made at the\n \n1\n\nsame time as the pneumatic drill came into general use. Together these inventions\ndrastically reduced the cost of blasting rock, drilling tunnels, building canals and many\nother forms of construction work.\nE\nThe market for dynamite and detonating caps grew very rapidly and Alfred Nobel also\nproved himself to be a very skillful entrepreneur and businessman. Over the years he\nfounded factories and laboratories in some 90 different places in more than 20 countries.\nAlthough he lived in Paris much of his life he was constantly traveling. When he was not\ntraveling or engaging in business activities Nobel himself worked intensively in his various\nlaboratories, first in Stockholm and later in other places. He focused on the development of\nexplosives technology as well as other chemical inventions including such materials as\nsynthetic rubber and leather, artificial silk, etc. By the time of his death in 18%, he had 355\npatents.\nF\nIntensive work and travel did not leave much time for private life. At the age of 43, he was\nfeeling like an old man. At this time he advertised in a newspaper “Wealthy, highly-\neducated elderly gentleman seeks the lady of mature age, versed in languages, as\nsecretary and supervisor of household.” The most qualified applicant turned out to be an\nAustrian woman, Countess Bertha Kinsky. After working a very short time for Nobel she\ndecided to return to Austria to marry Count Arthur von Suttner. In spite of this Alfred Nobel\nand Bertha von Suttner remained friends and kept writing letters to each other for decades.\nOver the years Bertha von Suttner became increasingly critical of the arms race. She wrote\na famous book, Lay Down Your Arms and became a prominent figure in the peace\nmovement. No doubt this influenced Alfred Nobel when he wrote his final will which was to\ninclude a Prize for persons or organizations who promoted peace. Several years after the\ndeath of Alfred Nobel, the Norwegian Storting (Parliament) decided to award the 1905\nNobel Peace Prize to Bertha von Suttner.\nG\nAlfred Nobel died in San Remo, Italy, on December 10, 1896. When his will was opened it\ncame as a surprise that his fortune was to be used for Prizes in Physics, Chemistry,\nPhysiology or Medicine, Literature and Peace. The executors of his will were two young\nengineers, Ragnar Sohlman and Rudolf Lilljequist. They set about forming the Nobel\nFoundation as an organization to take care of the financial assets left by Nobel for this\npurpose and to coordinate the work of the Prize-Awarding Institutions. This was not without\nits difficulties since the will was contested by relatives and questioned by authorities in\nvarious countries.\nH\nAlfred Nobel’s greatness lay in his ability to combine the penetrating mind of the scientist\nand inventor with the forward-looking dynamism of the industrialist. Nobel was very\ninterested in social and peace-related issues and held what were considered radical views\nin his era. He had a great interest in literature and wrote his own poetry and dramatic\nworks. The Nobel Prizes became an extension and a fulfillment of his lifetime interests.\n \n2",
