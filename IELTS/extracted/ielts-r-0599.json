  "passage_text": "Reading Practice\n \nUndersea Movement\nA\nThe underwater world holds many challenges. The most basic of these is movement. The\ndensity of water makes it difficult for animals to move. Forward movement is a complex\ninteraction of underwater forces. Additionally, water itself has movement. Strong currents\ncarry incredible power that can easily sweep creatures away. The challenges to aquatic\nmovement result in a variety of swimming methods, used by a wide range of animals. The\nresult is a dazzling underwater ballet.\nB\nFish rely on their skeleton, fins, and muscles to move. The primary function of the skeleton\nis to aid movement of other parts. Their skull acts as a fulcrum and their vertebrae act as\nlevers. The vertebral column consists of a series of vertebrae held together by ligaments,\nbut not so tightly as to prevent slight sideways movement between each pair of vertebrae.\nThe whole spine is, therefore, flexible. The skull is the only truly fixed part of a fish. It does\nnot move in and off itself but acts as a point of stability for other bones. These other bones\nact as levers that cause movement of the fish’s body.\nC\nWhile the bones provide the movement, the muscles supply the power. A typical fish has\nhundreds of muscles running in all directions around its body. This is why a fish can turn\nand twist and change directions quickly. The muscles on each side of the spine contract in\na series from head to tail and down each side alternately, causing a wave-like movement to\npass down the body. Such a movement may be very pronounced in fish such as eels, but\nhardly perceptible in others, e.g. mackerel. The frequency of the waves varies from about\n50/min in the dogfish to 170/min in the mackerel. The sideways and backward thrust of the\nhead and body against the water results in the resistance of the water pushing the fish\nsideways and forwards in a direction opposed to the thrust. When the corresponding set of\nmuscles on the other side contracts, the fish experiences a similar force from the water on\nthat side. The two sideways forces are equal and opposite unless the fish is making a turn,\nso they cancel out, leaving the sum of the two forward forces\nD\nThe muscles involved in swimming are of two main types. The bulk of a fish’s body is\ncomposed of the so-called white muscle, while the much smaller areas at the roots of the\nfins and in a strip along the centre of each flank comprise red muscle. The red muscle\nreceives a good supply of blood and contains ampler quantities of fat and glycogen, the\nstorage form of glucose, which is used for most day-to-day swimming movements. In\ncontrast, the white muscle has a poor blood supply and few energy stores, and it is used\nlargely for short-term, fast swimming. It might seem odd that the body of an animal which\nadapts adapted so efficiently to its environment should be composed almost entirely of a\ntype of muscle it rarely uses. However, this huge auxiliary power pack carried by a fish is of\ncrucial significance if the life of the fish is threatened-by a predator, for instance-because it\nenables the fish to swim rapidly away from danger.\nE\n \n1\n\nThe fins are the most distinctive features of a fish, composed of bony spines protruding\nfrom the body with skin covering them and joining them together, either in a webbed\nfashion, as seen in most bony fish, or more similar to a flipper, as seen in sharks. These\nusually serve as a means for the fish to swim. But it must be emphasized that the\nswimming movements are produced by the whole of the muscular body, and in only a few\nfish do the fins contribute any propulsive force! Their main function is to control the stability\nand direction of the fish: as water passes over its body, a fish uses its fins to thrust in the\ndirection it wishes to go.\nF\nFins located in different places on a fish serve different purposes, such as moving forward,\nturning, and keeping an upright position. The tail fin, in its final lash may contribute as much\nas 40 per cent of the forward thrust. The median fins, that is, the dorsal, anal and ventral\nfins, control the rolling and yawing movements of the fish by increasing the vertical surface\narea presented to the water. The paired fins, pectoral and pelvic act as hydroplanes and\ncontrol the pitch of the ash, causing it to swim downwards or upwards according to the\nangle to the water at which they are held by their muscles. The pectoral fins lie in front of\nthe centre of gravity and, being readily mobile, are chiefly responsible for sending the ash\nup or down. The paired ins are also the means by which the fish slows down and stops.\nG\nThe swimming speed of fish is not so fast as one would expect from watching their rapid\nmovements in aquaria or ponds. Tuna seems to be the fastest at 44 mph, trout are\nrecorded as doing 23 mph, pike 20 mph for short bursts and roach about 10 mph, while the\nmajority of small fish probably do not exceed 2 or 3 mph. Many people have attempted to\nmake accurate measurements of the speed at which various fish swim, either by timing\nthem over known distances in their natural environment or by determining their\nperformance in man-made swimming channels. From these studies, we can broadly\ncategorise fish into four groups: “sneakers”, such as eels that are only capable of slow\nspeeds but possess some staying power; “stayers”, that can swim quite fast over long\nperiods; “sprinters” that can generate fast bursts of speed (e.g. pike); and “crawlers” that\nare sluggish swimmers, although they can accelerate slightly (bream, for example).\nH\nOne type of sailfish is considered to be the fastest species of fish over short distances,\nachieving 68 mph over a three-second period, and anglers have recorded speeds in\nexcess of 40 mph over longer periods for several species of tuna. One is likely to consider\na fish’s swimming capabilities in relation to its size. However, it is generally true that a small\nfish is a more able swimmer than a much larger one. On the other hand in terms of speed\nin miles per hour, a big fish will, all other things being equal, be able to swim faster than a\nsmaller fish.\n \n2",
