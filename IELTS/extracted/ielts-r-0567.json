  "passage_text": "Reading Practice\n \nThe Value of a College Degree\nThe escalating cost of higher education is causing many to question the value of continuing\neducation beyond high school. Many wonder whether the high cost of tuition, the\nopportunity cost of choosing college over full-time employment, and the accumulation of\nthousands of dollars of debt is, in the long run, worth the investment.\nThe risk is especially large for low- income families who have a difficult time making ends\nmeet without the additional burden of college tuition and fees.\nIn order to determine whether higher education is worth the investment, it is useful to\nexamine what is known about the value of higher education and the rates of return on\ninvestment to both the individual and to society.\n~THE ECONOMIC VALUE OF HIGHER EDUCATION\nThere is considerable support for the notion that the rate of return on investment in higher\neducation is high enough to warrant the financial burden associated with pursuing a college\ndegree. Though the earnings differential between college and high school graduates varies\nover time, college graduates, on average, earn more than high school graduates.\nAccording to the Census Bureau, over an adult's working life, high school graduates earn\nan average of $1.2 million; associate’s degree holders earn about $1.6 million; and\nbachelor’s degree holders earn about $2.1 million (Day and Newburger, 2002).\nThese sizeable differences in lifetime earnings put the costs of college study in realistic\nperspective. Most students today—about 80 percent of all students—enroll either in public\nfour- year colleges or in public two-year colleges. According to the U.S. Department of\nEducation report. Think College Early, a full-time student at a public four-year college pays\nan average of $8,655 for in-state tuition, room, and board (U.S. Department of Education,\n2002). A fulltime student in a public two-year college pays an average of $1,359 per year in\ntuition (U.S. Department of Education, 2002).\nThese statistics support the contention that, though the cost of higher education is\nsignificant, given the earnings disparity that exists between those who earn a bachelor's\ndegree and those who do not, the individual rate of return on investment in higher\neducation is sufficiently high to warrant the cost.\n~OTHER BENEFIT! OF HIGHER EDUCATION\nCollege graduates also enjoy benefits beyond increased income. A1998 report published\nby the Institute for Higher Education Policy reviews the individual benefits that college\ngraduates enjoy, including higher levels of saving, increased personal/professional mobility,\nimproved quality of life for their offspring, better consumer decision making, and more\nhobbies and leisure activities (Institute for Higher Education Policy, 1998). According to a\nreport published by the Carnegie Foundation, nonmonetary individual benefits of higher\neducation include the tendency for postsecondary students to become more open-minded,\nmore cultured, more rational, more consistent, and less authoritarian; these benefits are\nalso passed along to succeeding generations (Rowley and Hurtado, 2002). Additionally,\ncollege attendance has been shown to \"decrease prejudice, enhance knowledge of world\naffairs and enhance social status\" while\n \n1\n\nincreasing economic and job security for those who earn bachelor’s degrees (Ibid.).\nResearch has also consistently shown a positive correlation between completion of higher\neducation and good health, not only for oneself, but also for one’s children. In fact,\n\"parental schooling levels (after controlling for differences in earnings) are positively\ncorrelated with the health status of their children\" and Increased schooling (and higher\nrelative income) are correlated with lower mortality rates for given age brackets\" (Cohn and\nGeske, 1992).\n~THE SOCIAL VALUE OF HIGHER EDUCATION\nA number of studies have shown a high correlation between higher education and cultural\nand family values, and economic growth. According to Elchanan Cohn and Terry Geske\n(1992), there is the tendency for more highly educated women to spend more time with\ntheir children; these women tend to use this time to better prepare their children for the\nfuture. Cohn and Geske (1992) report that \"college graduates appear to have a more\noptimistic view of their past and future personal progress.\"\nPublic benefits of attending college include increased tax revenues, greater workplace\nproductivity, increased consumption, increased workforce flexibility, and decreased reliance\non government financial support (Institute for Higher Education Policy, 1998)....\nCONCLUSION\nWhile it is clear that investment in a college degree, especially for those students in the\nlowest income brackets, is a financial burden, the long-term benefits to individuals as well\nas to society at large, appear to far outweigh the costs.\n \n2",
