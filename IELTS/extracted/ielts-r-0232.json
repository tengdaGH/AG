  "passage_text": "Reading Practice\n \nIs Graffiti Art or Crime\nA\nThe term graffiti derives from the Italian graffito meaning ‘scratching’ and can be defined as\nuninvited marking or writing scratched or applied to objects, built structures and natural\nfeatures. It is not a new phenomenon: examples can be found on ancient structures around\nthe world, in some cases predating the Greeks and Romans. In such circumstances it has\nacquired invaluable historical and archaeological significance, providing a social history of\nlife and events at that time. Graffiti is now a problem that has become pervasive, as a result\nof the availability of cheap and quick means of mark-making.\nB\nIt is usually considered a priority to remove graffiti as quickly as possible after it appears.\nThis is for several reasons. The first is to prevent ‘copy-cat’ emulation which can occur\nrapidly once a clean surface is defaced. It may also be of a racist or otherwise offensive\nnature and many companies and councils have a policy of removing this type of graffiti\nwithin an hour or two of it being reported. Also, as paints, glues and inks dry out over time\nthey can become increasingly difficult to remove and are usually best dealt with as soon as\npossible after the incident. Graffiti can also lead to move serious forms of vandalism and,\nultimately, the deterioration of an area, contributing to social decline.\nC\nAlthough graffiti may be regarded as an eyesore, any proposal to remove it from sensitive\nhistoric surfaces should be carefully considered: techniques designed for more robust or\nutilitarian surfaces may result in considerable damage. In the event of graffiti incidents, it is\nimportant that the owners of buildings or other structures and their consultants are aware of\nthe approach they should take in dealing with the problem. The police should be informed\nas there may be other related attacks occurring locally. An incidence pattern can identify\npossible culprits, as can stylised signatures or nicknames, known as ‘tags’, which may\nalready be familiar to local police. Photographs are useful to record graffiti incidents and\nmay assist the police in bringing a prosecution. Such images are also required for\ninsurance claims and can be helpful in cleaning operatives, allowing them to see the\nproblem area before arriving on site.\nD\nThere are a variety of methods that are used to remove graffiti. Broadly these divide\nbetween chemical and mechanical systems. Chemical preparations are based on\ndissolving the media; these solvents can range from water to potentially hazardous\nchemical ‘cocktails’. Mechanical systems such as wire-brushing and grit-blasting attempt to\nabrade or chip the media from the surface. Care should be taken to comply with health and\nsafety legislation with regard to the protection of both passers-by and any person carrying\nout the cleaning. Operatives should follow product guidelines in terms of application and\nremoval, and wear the appropriate protective equipment. Measures must be taken to\nensure that run-off, aerial mists, drips and splashes do not threaten unprotected members\nof the public. When examining a graffiti incident it is important to assess the ability of the\nsubstrate to withstand the prescribed treatment. If there is any doubt regarding this, then\n \n1\n\nsmall trial areas should be undertaken to assess the impact of more extensive treatment.\nE\nA variety of preventive strategies can be adopted to combat a recurring problem of graffiti\nat a given site. As no two sites are the same, no one set of protection measures will be\nsuitable for all situations. Each site must be looked at individually. Surveillance systems\nsuch as closed-circuit television may also help. In cities and towns around the country,\nprominently placed cameras have been shown to reduce anti-social behavior of all types\nincluding graffiti. Security patrols will also act as a deterrent to prevent recurring attacks.\nHowever, the cost of this may be too high for most situations. A physical barriers such as a\nwall, railings, doors or gates can be introduced to discourage unauthorized access to a\nvulnerable site. However, consideration has to be given to the impact measures have on\nthe structure being protected. In the worst cases, they can be almost as damaging to the\nquality of the environment as the graffiti they prevent. In others, they might simply provide a\nnew surface for graffiti.\nF\nOne of the most significant problems associated with graffiti removal is the need to remove\nit from surfaces that are repeatedly attacked. Under these circumstances, the repeated\nremoval of graffiti using even the most gentle methods will ultimately cause damage to the\nsurface material. There may be situations where the preventive strategies mentioned\nabove do not work or are not a viable proposition at a given site. Anti-graffiti coatings are\nusually applied by brush or spray leaving a thin veneer that essentially serves to isolate the\ngraffiti from the surface.\nG\nRemoval of graffiti from a surface that has been treated in this way is much easier, usually\nusing low-pressure water which reduces the possibility of damage. Depending on the type\nof barrier selected it may be necessary to reapply the coating after each graffiti removal\nexercise.\n \n2",
