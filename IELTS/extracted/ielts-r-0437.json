  "passage_text": "Reading Practice\n \nThe beginning of intelligence\nA No one doubts that intelligence develops as children grow older. Yet the concept of\nintelligence has proved both quite difficult to define in unambiguous terms and\nunexpectedly controversial in some respects. Although, at one level, there seem to be\nalmost as many definitions of intelligence as people who have tried to define it, there is\nbroad agreement on two key features. That is, intelligence involves the capacity not only to\nlearn from experience but also to adapt to one’s environment. However, we cannot leave\nthe concept there. Before turning to what is known about the development of intelligence, it\nis necessary to consider whether we are considering the growth of one or many skills. That\nquestion has been tackled in rather different ways by psychometricians and by\ndevelopmentalists.\nB The former group has examined the issue by determining how children’s abilities on a\nwide range of tasks intercorrelate, or go together. Statistical techniques have been used to\nfind out whether the patterns are best explained by one broad underlying capacity, general\nintelligence, or by a set of multiple, relatively separate, special skills in domains such as\nverbal and visuospatial ability. While it cannot be claimed that everyone agrees on what the\nresults mean, most people now accept that for practical purposes it is reasonable to\nsuppose that both are involved. In brief, the evidence in favour of some kind of general\nintellectual capacity is that people who are superior (or inferior) on one type of task tend\nalso to be superior (or inferior) on others. Moreover, general measures of intelligence tend\nto have considerable powers to predict a person’s performance on a wide range of tasks\nrequiring special skills. Nevertheless, it is plain that it is not at all uncommon for individuals\nto be very good at some sorts of task and yet quite poor at some others. \nC Furthermore the influences that affect verbal skills are not quite the same as those that\naffect other skills. This approach to investigating intelligence is based on the nature of the\ntask involved, but studies of age-related changes show that this is not the only, or\nnecessarily the most important, approach. For instance, some decades ago, Horn and\nCattell argued for a differentiation between what they termed‘fluid’ and‘crystallised’\nintelligence. Fluid abilities are best assessed by tests that require mental manipulation of\nabstract symbols. Crystallised abilities, by contrast, reflect knowledge of the environment in\nwhich we live and past experience of similar tasks; they may be assessed by tests of\ncomprehension and information. It seems that fluid abilities peak in early adult life, whereas\ncrystallised abilities increase up to advanced old.\nD Developmental studies also show that the interconnections between different skills vary\nwith age. Thus in the first year of life an interest in perceptual patterns is a major\ncontributor to cognitive abilities, whereas verbal abilities are more important later on. These\nfindings seemed to suggest a substantial lack of continuity between infancy and middle\nchildhood. However, it is important to realise that the apparent discontinuity will vary\naccording to which of the cognitive skills were assessed in infancy. It has been found that\ntests of coping with novelty do predict later intelligence. These findings reinforce the view\nthat young children’s intellectual performance needs to be assessed from their interest in\nand curiosity about the environment, and the extent to which this is applied to new\nsituations, as well as by standardised intelligence testing.\nE These psychometric approaches have focused on children’s increase in cognitive skills\n \n1\n\nas they grow older. Piaget brought about a revolution in the approach to cognitive\ndevelopment through his arguments ( backed up by observations) that the focus should be\non the thinking processes involved rather than on levels of cognitive achievement These\nideas of Piaget gave rise to an immense body of research and it would be true to say that\nsubsequent thinking has been heavily dependent on his genius in opening up new ways of\nthinking about cognitive development. Nevertheless, most of his concepts have had to be\nso radically revised, or rejected, that his theory no longer provides an appropriate basis for\nthinking about cognitive development To appreciate why that is so, we need to focus on\nsome rather different elements of Piaget’s theorising. \nF The first element, which has stood the test of time, is his view that the child is nactive\nagent of learning and of the importance of this activity in cognitive development Numerous\nstudies have shown how infants actively scan their environment; how they prefer patterned\nto non-patterned objects, how they choose novel over familiar stimuli, and how they explore\ntheir environment as if to see how it works. Children’s questions and comments vividly\nillustrate the ways in which they are constantly constructing schemes of what they know\nand trying out their ideas of how to fit new knowledge into those schemes or deciding that\nthe schemes need modification. Moreover, a variety of studies have shown that active\nexperiences have a greater effect on learning than comparable passive experiences.\nHowever, a second element concerns the notion that development proceeds through a\nseries of separate stages that have to be gone through step-by-step, in a set order, each of\nwhich is characterised by a particular cognitive structure. That has turned out to be a rather\nmisleading way of thinking about cognitive development, although it is not wholly wrong.\n \n2",
