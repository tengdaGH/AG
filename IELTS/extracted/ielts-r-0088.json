  "passage_text": "Reading Practice\n \n \nChanges in Air\n \nA A federal ban on ozone-depleting chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), to conform with the Clean\nAir Act, is, ironically, affecting 22.9 million people in the U.S. who suffer from asthma.\nGeneric inhaled albuterol, which is the most commonly prescribed short-acting asthma\nmedication and requires CFCs to propel it into the lungs, will no longer be legally sold after\nDecember 31,\n2008. Physicians and patients are questioning the wisdom of the ban, which will have an\ninsignificant effect on ozone but a measurable impact on wallets: the reformulated brand-\nname alternatives can be three times as expensive, raising the cost to about $40 per\ninhaler. The issue is even more disconcerting considering that asthma disproportionately\naffects the poor and that, according to recent surveys, an estimated 20 percent of asthma\npatients are uninsured.\n \nB “The decision to make the change was political, not medical or scientific,” says\npharmacist Leslie Hendeles of the University of Florida, who co-authored a 2007 paper in\nthe New England Journal of Medicine explaining the withdrawal and transition. In 1987\nCongress signed on to the Montreal Protocol on Substances That Deplete the Ozone\nLayer, an international treaty requiring the phasing out of all nonessential uses of CFCs. At\nthat time, medical inhalers were considered an essential use because no viable\nalternative propellant existed. In 1989 pharmaceutical companies banded together and\neventually, in 1996, reformulated albuterol with hydrofluoroalkane.\n \nC The transition began quietly, but as more patients see their prescriptions change and\ncosts go up, many question why this ban must begin before generics become available.\nAt least one member of the FDA advisory committee, Nicholas J. Gross of the Stritch-\nLoyola School of Medicine, has publicly regretted the decision, recanting his support and\nrequesting that the ban be pushed back until 2010, when the first patent expfres.\n \nD Gross notes that the decision had nothing to do with the envfronment. Albuterol inhalers\ncontributed less than 0.1 percent of the CFCs released when the treaty was signed. “It’s a\nsymbolic issue,” Gross remarks. Some skeptics instead point to the billions of dollars to be\ngained by the three companies holding the patents on the available HFA-albuterol inhalers,\nnamely Glaxo-SmithKline, Schering-Plough and Teva. Although the FDA advisory\ncommittee recognized that the expenses would go up, Hendeles says, it also believed that\nthe companies would help defray the added costs for individuals. Firms, for instance, had\ncommitted to donating a million HFA inhalers to clinics around the country. According to\nHendeles, GlaxoSmithKline did not follow through, although Schering-Plough and Teva did.\nGlaxoSmithKline did not respond to requests for comment.\n \nE The issue now, Hendeles says, is that pharmaceutical-grade CFCs are in short supply,\nand the public faces the risk of a shortage of albuterol inhalers if the FDA does not continue\npromoting the production of HFA inhalers. He posits that even costs of generics would go\nup as CFCs become scarcer. Gross disagrees, saying that the inhaler shortage and the\nclosure of CFC manufacturing plants are a result of the ban.\nF The HFA inhalers also have encountered resistance because some asthmatics insist that\nthey do not work as well as the CFC variety. But, Hendeles says, the differences are in the\n \n1\n\n \nmechanics and maintenance—unlike CFC inhalers, the HFA versions must be primed more\ndiligently and rinsed to accommodate the stickier HFA formulation. They also run out\nsuddenly without the warning with a CFC inhaler, that the device is running low.\n“Pharmacists may not tell people of these things, and the doctors don’t know,” Hendeles\nsays.\n \nG The main public health issue in this decision may be the side effects of the economics,\nnot the drug chemistry. Multiple studies have shown that raising costs leads to poorer\nadherence to treatment. One study discovered that patients took 30 percent less\nantiasthma medication when thefr co-pay doubled. In the case of a chronic disease such as\nasthma, it is particularly difficult to get people to follow regular treatment plans. “Generally\nspeaking, for any reason you don’t take medication, cost makes it more likely” that you do\nnot, comments Michael Chemew, a health policy expert at Harvard Medical School.\nH Such choices to forgo medication could affect more than just the patients themselves.\n“For example,” Hendeles points out, “in a pregnant mother with untreated asthma, less\noxygen is delivered to the fetus, which can lead to congenital problems and premature\nbirth.” And considering that the disease disproportionately strike s the poor, what seemed\nto be a good, responsible environmental decision might in the end exact an unexpected\nhuman toll.\n \n2",
