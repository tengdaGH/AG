  "passage_text": "Reading Practice\n \nEnsuring our future food supply\nClimate change and new diseases threaten the limited varieties of seeds we depend on for\nfood. Luckily, we still have many of the seeds used in the past-but we must take steps to\nsave them.\nSix miles outside the town of Decorah, Iowa in the USA, an 890-acre stretch of rolling fields\nand woods called Heritage Farm is letting its crops go to seed. Everything about Heritage\nFarm is in stark contrast to the surrounding acres of intensively farmed fields of corn and\nsoybean that are typical of modern agriculture. Heritage Farm is devoted to collecting\nrather than growing seeds. It is home to the Seed Savers Exchange, one of the largest non\ngovernment-owned seed banks in the United States.\nIn 1975 Diane Ott Whealy was given the seedlings of two plant varieties that her great\ngrandfather had brought to America from Bavaria in 1870: Grandpa Ott’s morning glory and\nhis German Pink tomato. Wanting to preserve similar traditional varieties, known as\nheirloom plants, Diane and her husband, Kent, decided to establish a place where the\nseeds of the past could be kept and traded. The exchange now has more than 13,000\nmembers, and the many thousands of heirloom varieties they have donated are kept in its\nwalk-in coolers, freezers, and root cellars the seeds of many thousands of heirloom\nvarieties and, as you walk around an old red barn that is covered in Grandpa Ott’s beautiful\nmorning glory blossoms, you come across the different vegetables, herbs, and flowers they\nhave planted there.\n\"Each year our members list their seeds in this,\"Diane Ott Whealy says, handing over a\ncopy of the Seed Savers Exchange 2010 Yearbook. It is as thick as a big-city telephone\ndirectory, with page after page of exotic beans, garlic, potatoes, peppers, apples, pears,\nand plums-each with its own name and personal history .For example, there’s an Estonian\nYellow Cherry tomato, which was brought to the seed bank by “an elderly Russian lady”\nwho lived in Tallinn, and a Persian Star garlic from “a bazaar in Samarkand.”There’s also a\nbean donated by archaeologists searching for pygmy elephant fossils in New Mexico.\nHeirloom vegetables have become fashionable in the United States and Europe over the\npast decade, prized by a food movement that emphasizes eating locally and preserving the\nflavor and uniqueness of heirloom varieties. Found mostly in farmers' markets and boutique\ngroceries, heirloom varieties have been squeezed out of supermarkets in favor of modern\nsingle-variety fruits and vegetables bred to ship well and have a uniform appearance, not to\nenhance flavor. But the movement to preserve heirloom varieties goes way beyond the\ncurrent interest in North America and Europe in tasty, locally grown food. It’s also a\ncampaign to protect the world’s future food supply.Most people in the well-fed world give\nlittle thought to where their food comes from or how it’s grown. They wander through well-\nstocked supermarkets without realizing that there may be problem ahead.We’ve been\nhearing for some time about the loss of flora and fauna in our rainforests.Very little,by\ncontrast,is being said or done about the parallel decline in the diversity of the foods we eat.\nFood variety extinction is happening all over the world - and it's happening fast. In the\nUnited States an estimated 90 percent of historic fruit and vegetable varieties are no longer\ngrown. Of the 7,000 different apple varieties that were grown in the 1800s, fewer than a\nhundred remain. In the Philippines thousands of varieties of rice once thrived; now only\nabout a hundred are grown there. In China 90 percent of the wheat varieties cultivated just\n \n1\n\na hundred years ago have disappeared. Experts estimate that in total we have lost more\nthan 50 percent of the world's food varieties over the past century.\nWhy is this a problem? Because if disease or future climate change affects one of the\nhandful of plants we've come to depend on to feed our growing planet, we might\ndesperately need one of those varieties we've let become extinct. The loss of the world's\ncereal diversity is a particular cause for concern. A fungus called Ug99, which was first\nidentified in Uganda in 1999, is spreading across the world's wheat crops. From Uganda it\nmoved to Kenya, Ethiopia, Sudan, and Yemen. By 2007 it had jumped the Persian Gulf into\nIran. Scientists predict that the fungus will soon make its way into India and Pakistan, then\nspread to Russia and China, and eventually the USA.\nRoughly 90 percent of the world's wheat has no defense against this particular fungus. If it\nreached the USA, an estimated one billion dollars' worth of crops would be at risk.\nScientists believe that in Asia and Africa alone, the portion currently in danger could leave\none billion people without their primary food source. A famine with significant humanitarian\nconsequences could follow, according to Rick Ward of Cornell University.\nThe population of the world is expected to reach nine billion by 2045. Some experts say\nwe’ll need to double our food production to keep up with this growth. Given the added\nchallenge of climate change and disease, it is becoming ever more urgent to find ways to\nincrease food yield. The world has become increasingly dependent upon a technology-\ndriven, one-size-fits-all approach to food supply. Yet the best hope for securing our food's\nfuture may depend on our ability to preserve the locally cultivated foods of the past.\n \n2",
