  "passage_text": "Reading Practice\n \nToddlers Bond With Robot\n(A) Will the robot revolution begin in nursery school? Researchers introduced a state-of-\nthe-art social robot into a classroom of 18- to 24-month-olds for five months as a way of\nstudying human-robot interactions. The children not only came to accept the robot, but\ntreated it as they would a human buddy - hugging it and helping it - a new study says. \"The\nresults imply that current robot technology is surprisingly close to achieving autonomous\nbonding and socialization with human toddlers,\" said Fumihide Tanaka, a researcher at the\nUniversity of California, San Diego\n(B) The development of robots that interact socially with people has been difficult to\nachieve, experts say, partly because such interactions are hard to study. \"To my\nknowledge, this is the first long-term study of this sort,\" said Ronald Arkin, a roboticist at\nthe Georgia Institute of Technology, who was not involved with the study. \"It is\ngroundbreaking and helps to forward human-robot interaction studies significantly,\" he\nsaid.\n(C) The most successful robots so far have been storytellers, but they have only been able\nto hold human interest for a limited time. For the new study, researchers introduced a\ntoddler-size humanoid robot into a classroom at a UCSD childhood education center.\nInitially the researchers wanted to use a 22-inch-tall model, but later they decided to use\nanother robot of the QRIO series, the 23-inch-tall (58-centimeter-tall) machine was\noriginally developed by Sony. Children of toddler age were chosen because they have no\npreconceived notions of robots, said Tanaka, the lead researcher, who also works for\nSony. The researchers sent instructions about every two minutes to the robot to do things\nlike giggle, dance, sit down, or walk in a certain direction. The 45 sessions were\nvideotaped, and interactions between toddlers and the robot were later analyzed.\n(D) The results showed that the quality of those interactions improved steadily over 27\nsessions. The tots began to increasingly interact with the robot and treat it more like a peer\nthan an object during the first 11 sessions. The level of social activity increased\ndramatically when researchers added a new behavior to QRIO's repertoire: If a child\ntouched the humanoid on its head, it would make a giggling noise. The interactions\ndeteriorated quickly over the next 15 sessions, when the robot was reprogrammed to\nbehave in a more limited, predictable manner. Finally, the human-robot relations improved\nin the last three sessions, after the robot had been reprogrammed to display its full range of\nbehaviors. \"Initially the children treated the robot very differently than the way they treated\neach other,\" Tanaka said. \"But by the end they treated the robot as a peer rather than a\ntoy.\"\n(E) Early in the study some children cried when QRIO fell. But a month into the study, the\ntoddlers helped QRIO stand up by pushing its back or pulling its hands. “The most\nimportant aspect of interaction was touch”, Tanaka said. “At first the toddlers would touch\nthe robot on its face, but later on they would touch only on its hands and arms, like they\nwould with other humans”. Another robotlike toy named Robby, which resembled QRIO but\n \n1\n\ndid not move, was used as a control toy in the study. While hugging of QRIO increased,\nhugging of Robby decreased throughout the study. Furthermore, when QRIO laid down on\nthe floor as its batteries ran down, a toddler would put a blanket over his silver-colored\n\"friend\" and say \"night-night.\"\n(F) \"Our work suggests that touch integrated on the time-scale of a few minutes is a\nsurprisingly effective index of social connectedness,\" Tanaka says. \"Something akin to this\nindex may be used by the human brain to evaluate its own sense of social well-being.\" He\nadds that social robots like QRIO could greatly enrich classrooms and assist teachers in\nearly learning programs. Hiroshi Ishiguro - robotics expert at Osaka University in Japan -\nsays, \"I think this study has clearly reported the possibilities of small, almost autonomous\nhumanoid robots for toddlers. Nowadays robots can perform a variety of functions that\nwere thought to be incident to people only - in short time we’ll have electronic baby-sitters\nand peer-robots in every kindergarten,\" said Ishiguro, who was not involved with the study\nbut has collaborated with its authors on other projects.\n(G) Now this study has taken a new direction - the researchers are now developing\nautonomous robots for the toddler classroom. \"I cannot avoid underlining how great\npotential it could have in educational settings assisting teachers and enriching the\nclassroom environment,\" Tanaka said. However, some scientists don’t share his opinion.\n(H) Arkin, the Georgia Tech roboticist, said he was not surprised by the affection showed\nby the toddlers toward the robot. \"Humans have a tremendous propensity to bond with\nartifacts with any or all sort, whether it be a car, a doll, or a robot,\" he said. But he also\ncautioned that researchers don't yet understand the consequences of increased human-\nrobot interaction. \"Just studying how robots and humans work together can give us insight\ninto whether this is a good thing or a bad thing for society,\" Akrin said. \"What are the\nconsequences of introducing a robot artifact into a cadre of children? How will that\nenhance, or potentially interfere with, their social development? It might make life easier for\nthe teacher, but we really don't understand the long-term impact of having a robot as a\nchildhood friend, do we?\"\n \n2",
