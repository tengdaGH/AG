  "passage_text": "Reading Practice\nThe Romantic Poets\nOne of the most evocative eras in the history of poetry must surely be that of the Romantic\nMovement. During the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries a group of poets\ncreated a new mood in literary objectives, casting off their predecessors’ styles in favour of\na gripping and forceful art which endures with us to this day.\nFive poets emerged as the main constituents of this movement – William Wordsworth,\nSamuel Taylor Coleridge, George Gordon Byron, Percy Bysshe Shelley and John Keats.\nThe strength of their works lies undoubtedly in the power of their imagination. Indeed,\nimagination was the most critical attribute of the Romantic poets. Each poet had the ability\nto portray remarkable images and visions, although differing to a certain degree in their\nintensity and presentation. Nature, mythology and emotion were of great importance and\nwere used to explore the feelings of the poet himself.\nThe lives of the poets often overlapped and tragedy was typical in most of them. Byron was\nborn in London in 1788. The family moved to Aberdeen soon after, where Byron was\nbrought up until he inherited the family seat of Newstead Abbey in Nottinghamshire from\nhis great uncle. He graduated from Cambridge University in 1808 and left England the\nfollowing year to embark on a tour of the Mediterranean. During this tour, he developed a\npassion for Greece which would later lead to his death in 1824. He left for Switzerland in\n1816 where he was introduced to Shelley.\nShelley was bom to a wealthy family in 1792. He was educated at Eton and then went on to\nOxford. Shelley was not happy in England, where his colourful lifestyle and unorthodox\nbeliefs made him unpopular with the establishment In 1818 he left for Italy, where he was\nreunited with Byron. However, the friendship was tragically brought to an end in July 1822,\nwhen Shelley was drowned in a boating accident off the Italian coast. In somewhat\ndramatic form, Shelley’s body was cremated on the beach, witnessed by a small group of\nfriends, including Byron.\nHistorically, Shelley and Byron are considered to have been the most outspoken and\nradical of the Romantic poets. By contrast, Wordsworth appears to have been of a pleasant\nand acceptable personality, even receiving the status of Poet Laureate in 1843. He was\nborn in 1770 in Cockermouth, Cumbria. By the time he entered his early teens, both his\nparents had died. As he grew older, Wordsworth developed a passion for writing.\nIn 1798 Wordsworth published a collection of poems with Coleridge, whom he had met, a\nfew years earlier, when he settled in Somerset with his sister Dorothy. He married in 1802\nand, as time passed, he deserted his former political views and became increasingly\nacceptable to popular society. Indeed, at the time of his death in the spring of 1850, he had\nbecome one of the most sought-after poets of his time.\nWordsworth shared some of the years at Dove Cottage in Somerset with his friend and\npoetical contemporary, Coleridge. Coleridge was born in Devon in 1772. He was a bright\nyoung scholar but never achieved the same prolific output of his fellow Romantic poets. In\n1804 he left for a position in Malta for three years. On his return he separated from his wife\nand went to live with the Wordsworths, where he produced a regular periodical.\nWith failing health, he later moved to London. In 1816 he went to stay with a doctor and his\n \n1\n\nfamily. He remained with them until his death in 1834. During these latter years, his poetry\nwas abandoned for other forms of writing equally outstanding in their own right.\nPerhaps the most tragic of the Romantic poets was Keats. Keats was born in London in\n1795. Similar to Wordsworth, both his parents had died by his early teens. He studied as a\nsurgeon, qualifying in 1816. However, poetry was his great passion and he decided to\ndevote himself to writing. For much of his adult life Keats was in poor health and fell gravely\nill in early 1820. He knew he was dying and in the September of that year he left for Rome\nhoping that the more agreeable climate might ease his suffering. Keats died of\nconsumption in February 1821 at the age of twenty-five.\nIt is sad that such tragedy often accompanies those of outstanding artistic genius. We can\nonly wonder at the possible outcome had they all lived to an old age. Perhaps even Byron\nand Shelley would have mellowed with the years, like Wordsworth. However, the\ncontribution to poetry by all five writers is immeasurable. They introduced the concepts of\nindividualism and imagination, allowing us to explore our own visions of beauty without\nretribution. We are not now required to restrain our thoughts and poetry to that of the\nsocially acceptable.\n \n2",
