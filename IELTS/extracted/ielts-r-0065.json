  "passage_text": "Reading Practice\n \nBilingualism in Children\nA\nOne misguided legacy of over a hundred years of writing on bilingualism1 is that children’s\n. intelligence will suffer if they are bilingual. Some of the earliest research into bilingualism\nexamined whether bilingual children were ahead or behind monolingual2 children on IQ\ntests. From the 1920s through to the 1960s, the tendency was to find monolingual children\nahead of bilinguals on IQ tests. The conclusion was that bilingual children were mentally\nconfused. Having two languages in the brain, it was said, disrupted effective thinking. It\nwas argued that having one well-developed language was superior to having two half-\ndeveloped languages.\nB\nThe idea that bilinguals may have a lower IQ still exists among many people, particularly\nmonolinguals. However, we now know that this early research was misconceived and\nincorrect. First, such research often gave bilinguals an IQ test in their weaker language –\nusually English. Had bilinguals been tested in Welsh or Spanish or Hebrew, a different\nresult may have been found. The testing of bilinguals was thus unfair. Second, like was not\ncompared with like. Bilinguals tended to come from, for example, impoverished New York\nor rural Welsh backgrounds. The monolinguals tended to come from more middle class,\nurban families. Working class bilinguals were often compared with middle class\nmonolinguals. So the results were more likely to be due to social class differences than\nlanguage differences. The comparison of monolinguals and bilinguals was unfair.\nC\nThe most recent research from Canada, the United States and Wales suggests that\nbilinguals are, at least, equal to monolinguals on IQ tests. When bilinguals have two well-\ndeveloped languages (in the research literature called balanced bilinguals), bilinguals tend\nto show a slight superiority in IQ tests compared with monolinguals. This is the received\npsychological wisdom of the moment and is good news for raising bilingual children. Take,\nfor example, a child who can operate in either language in the curriculum in the school.\nThat child is likely to be ahead on IQ tests compared with similar (same gender, social\nclass and age) monolinguals. Far from making people mentally confused, bilingualism is\nnow associated with a mild degree of intellectual superiority.\nD\nOne note of caution needs to be sounded. IQ tests probably do not measure intelligence.\nIQ tests measure a small sample of the broadest concept of intelligence. IQ tests are\nsimply paper and pencil tests where only ’right and wrong ’answers are allowed. Is all\nintelligence summed up in such right and wrong, pencil and paper tests? Isn’t there a wider\nvariety of intelligences that are important in everyday functioning and everyday life?\nE\nMany questions need answering. Do wc only define an intelligent person as somebody who\nobtains a high score on an IQ test? Are the only intelligent people those who belong to high\nIQ organisations such as MENSA? Is there social intelligence, musical intelligence, military\n \n1\n\nintelligence, marketing intelligence, motoring intelligence, political intelligence? Are all, or\nindeed any, of these forms of intelligence measured by a simple pencil and paper IQ test\nwhich demands a single, acceptable, correct solution to each question? Defining what\nconstitutes intelligent behaviour requires a personal value judgement as to what type of\nbehaviour, and what kind of person is of more worth.\nF\nThe current state of psychological wisdom about bilingual children is that, where two\nlanguages are relatively well developed, bilinguals have thinking advantages over\nmonolinguals.Take an example. A child is asked a simple question: How many uses can\nyou think offer a brick? Some children give two or three answers only. They can think of\nbuilding walls, building a house and perhaps that is all. Another child scribbles away,\npouring out ideas one after the other: blocking up a rabbit hole, breaking a window, using\nas a bird bath, as a plumb line, as an abstract sculpture in an art exhibition.\nG\nResearch across different continents of the world shows that bilinguals tend to be more\nfluent, flexible, original and elaborate in their answers to this type of open-ended question.\nThe person who can think of a few answers tends to be termed a convergent thinker.They\nconverge onto a few acceptable conventional answers. People who think of lots of different\nuses for unusual items (e.g. a brick, tin can, cardboard box) are called divergers. Divergers\nlike a variety of answers to a question and are imaginative and fluent in their thinking.\nH\nThere are other dimensions in thinking where approximately ’balanced’ bilinguals may have\ntemporary and occasionally permanent advantages over monolinguals: increased\nsensitivity to communication, a slightly speedier movement through the stages of cognitive\ndevelopment, and being less fixed on the sounds of words and more centred on the\nmeaning of words. Such ability to move away from the sound of words and fix on the\nmeaning of words tends to be a (temporary) advantage for bilinguals around the ages four\nto six This advantage may mean an initial head start in learning to read and learning to\nthink about language.\n1 bilingualism: the ability to speak two languages\n2 monolingual: using or speaking only one language\n \n2",
