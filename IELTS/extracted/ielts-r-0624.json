It is also about how much information you can\nremember when you have finished reading. The World Championship Speed-Reading\nCompetition says that its top competitors average between 1,000 and 2,000 words a\nminute. But they must remember at least 50 percent of this in order to qualify for the\ncompetition.\nB\nNowadays, speed reading has become an essential skill in any environment where people\nhave to master a large volume of information. Professional workers need reading skills to\nhelp them get through many documents every day, while students under pressure to deal\nwith assignments may feel they have to read more and read faster all the time.\nC\nAlthough there are various methods to increase reading speed, the trick is deciding what\ninformation you want first. For example, if you only want a rough outline of an issue, then\nyou can skim the material quickly and extract the key facts. However, if you need to\nunderstand every detail in a document, then you must read it slowly enough to understand\nthis.\nD\nEven when you know how to ignore irrelevant detail, there are other improvements you can\nmake to your reading style which will increase your speed. For example, most people can\nread much faster if they read silently. Reading each word aloud takes time for the\ninformation to make a complete circuit in your brain before being pronounced. Some\nresearchers believe that as long as the first and last letters are in place, the brain can still\nunderstand the arrangement of the other letters in the word because it logically puts each\npiece into place.\nE\nChunking is another important method. Most people learn to read either letter by letter or\nword by word. As you improve, this changes. You will probably find that you are fixing your\neyes on a block of words, then moving your eyes to the next block of words, and so on.\nYou are reading blocks of words at a time, not individual words one by one. You may also\nnotice that you do not always go from one block to the next: sometimes you may move\nback to a previous block if you are unsure about something.\nF\nA skilled reader will read a lot of words in each block. He or she will only look at each block\nfor an instant and will then move on. Only rarely will the reader’s eyes skip back to a\nprevious block of words. This reduces the amount of work that the reader’s eyes have to\ndo. It also increases the volume of information that can be taken in over a given period of\ntime.\n \n1\n\nG\nOn the other hand, a slow reader will spend a lot of time reading small blocks of words. He\nor she will skip back often, losing the flow and structure of the text, and muddling their\noverall understanding of the subject. This irregular eye movement quickly makes the reader\ntired. Poor readers tend to dislike reading because they feel it is difficult to concentrate and\ncomprehend written information.\nH\nThe best tip anyone can have to improve their reading speed is to practise. In order to do\nthis effectively, a person must be engaged in the material and want to know more. If you\nfind yourself constantly having to re-read the same paragraph, you may want to switch to\nreading material that grabs your attention. If you enjoy what you are reading, you will make\nquicker progress.\n \n2",
