  "passage_text": "Reading Practice\n \nThe History of the Invention of Plastics\n{A} Natural polymers include such familiar substances as silk, rubber, and cotton. Plastics\nare artificial polymers. Plastics are used on a daily basis throughout the world. The word\nplastic is a common term that is used for many materials of a synthetic or semi-synthetic\nnature. The term was derived from the Greek plastikos, which means “fit for molding.”\nPlastics are a wide variety of combinations of properties when viewed as a whole. They are\nused for shellac, cellulose, rubber, and asphalt. We also synthetically manufacture items\nsuch as clothing, packaging, automobiles, electronics, aircraft, medical supplies, and\nrecreational items. The list could go on and on and it is obvious that much of what we have\ntoday would not be possible without plastics.\n \n{B} In the early part of the twentieth century, a big boom occurred in polymer chemistry\nwhen polymer materials such as nylon and Kevlar came on the scene. Much of the work\ndone with polymers focuses on improvement while using existing technologies, but\nchemists do have opportunities ahead. There is a need for the development of new\napplications for polymers, always looking for less expensive materials that can replace\nwhat is used now. Chemists have to be more aware of what the market yearns for, such as\nproducts with a green emphasis, polymers that break down or are environmentally friendly.\nConcerns such as these have brought new activity to the science arena and there are\nalways new discoveries to be made.\n{C} The evolution of the chemistry behind plastics is mind-numbing, and the uses for\nplastics are endless. In the Middle Ages, when scientists first started to experiment, plastics\nwere derived from organic natural sources, such as egg and blood proteins. It wasn’t until\nthe 19th and 20thcenturies that the plastics we know today were created. Many Americans\nwill recognize the name Goodyear, it was Charles Goodyear who began the modern-day\nplastic revolution when he vulcanized rubber in 1839, paving the way for the tire. Prior to\nhis discovery, products made with rubber did not hold up well in warm temperatures or\nclimates. Rubber is only one source of plastic, however, and three key inventors followed\nGoodyear’s path and took plastic from a nearly unusable hard substance to the invaluable\nman-made resource it is today.\n{D} The son of a brass lock manufacturer, Alexander Parkes was born in Birmingham,\nEngland in 1813. Parkes was raised around metal fabrication. In his first job he worked as\nan apprentice at Birmingham’s brass foundry, owned by Samuel S. Messengers and Sons.\nParkes switched his attention from brass work to electroplating when he went to work for\nGeorge and Henry Elkington. It was there Parkes developed his inventive spirit. Parkes’\nfirst patent, awarded in 1841, dealt with electroplating delicate items such as flowers, but\nthroughout his career Parkes reportedly held more than 80 patents on his works with both\nmetals and plastics.Parkes is credited with inventing the first man-made plastic, which he\npatented as Parkesine in 1856. Parkes introduced this combination of nitrocellulose and\nsolvents to England in 1862 at the London International Exhibition. While Parkesine itself\ndid not prove to be a successful material in its original formulation, it was too flammable, it\nlaid the groundwork for successful derivative materials from future inventors. One of those\ninventors being John Wesley Hyatt.\n{E} What Alexander Parkes started, John Wesley Hyatt took to the next level. Hyatt was\n \n1\n\n \nborn in Starkey, New York in 1837, and patented several hundred inventions. Hyatt’s link to\nplastics comes in the form of the game of billiards. Billiard balls were originally made of\nivory, a commodity that was in steep decline in the 1800s. Most likely inspired by the\n$10,000 reward being offered, Hyatt took on the challenge of finding a substitute material to\nmanufacture billiard balls. Hyatt’s experiments began with a combination of Parkes’\nParkesine, a solid form of nitrocellulose, and another English inventor, Frederick Scott\nArcher, discovery of liquid nitrocellulose. Hyatt combined two to create celluloid, which he\npatented in 1870.\n{F} Celluloid was used for numerous products, including billiard balls for Hyatt’s own\ncompany rather than his former employer. Celluloid also produced false teeth, combs, baby\nrattles, and piano keys. Despite its replacement by newer synthetic materials in today’s\nmarketplace, Hyatt’s patented version of celluloid is still used to produce ping-pong balls.\nThere is no doubt that the invention of celluloid was the next important rung in the plastic\nmanufacturing ladder, including the use of celluloid in film production.\n{G} Much like Parkes’ invention led to Hyatt’s success, Hyatt’s celluloid influenced Leo\nBaekeland. This Belgium-born chemist paved the way for George Eastman, of Eastman\nKodak, to build the photographic empire we know today. Born in 1863, Baekeland’s first\ninvention was Velox, a paper that allowed photographs to be taken in artificial light.\nEastman purchased the Velox process from Baekeland for a reported $750,000 in 1899.\nBaekeland used that money to fund his own in-home laboratory.\n{H} Baekeland moved his experiments from photography paper to synthetic resins, and\ninvented Bakelite, a combination of phenol and formaldehyde in 1907. Bakelite was\nofficially patented in 1909. Bakelite was a hard, yet moldable, plastic, and was considered\nthe product that led the world into the Age of Plastics. Bakelite was used in everything from\nbuttons to art deco furniture to television sets. While these items are made from different\ntypes of materials today, Bakelite is still used in the production of items such as car brakes\nand materials used in the space shuttle. \n \n2",
