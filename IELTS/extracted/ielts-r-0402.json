  "passage_text": "Reading Practice\n \nSpace: The Final Archaeological Frontier\nSpace travel may still have a long nay to go, bur the notion of archaeological\nresearch and heritage management in space is already concerning scientists and\nenvironmentalists.\nIn 1993, University of Hawaii’s anthropologist Ben Finney, who for much of his career has\nstudied the technology once used by Polynesians to colonize islands in the Pacific,\nsuggested that it would not be premature to begin thinking about the archaeology of\nRussian and American aerospace sites on the Moon and Mars. Finney pointed out that just\nas todays scholars use archaeological records to investigate how Polynesians diverged\nculturally as they explored the Pacific, archaeologists will someday study off-Earth sites to\ntrace the development of humans in space. He realized that it was unlikely anyone would\nbe able to conduct fieldwork in the near future, but he was convinced that one day such\nwork would be done.\nThere is a growing awareness, however, that it won’t be long before both corporate\nadventurers and space tourists reach the Moon and Mars. There is a wealth of important\narchaeological sites from the history of space exploration on the Moon and Mars and\nmeasures need to be taken to protect these sites. In addition to the threat from profit-\nseeking corporations, scholars cite other potentially destructive forces such as souvenir\nhunting and unmonitored scientific sampling, as has already occurred in explorations of\nremote polar regions. Already in 1999 one company was proposing a robotic lunar rover\nmission beginning at the site of Tranquility Base and rumbling across the Moon from one\narchaeological site to another, from the wreck of the Ranger S probe to Apollo 17 s landing\nsite. The mission, which would leave vehicle tyre- marks all over some of the most famous\nsites on the Moon, was promoted as a form of theme-park entertainment.\nAccording to the vaguely worded United Motions Outer Space Treaty of 1967. what it terms\n‘space junk’ remains the property of the country that sent the craft or probe into space. But\nthe treaty doesn’t explicitly address protection of sites like Tranquility Base, and equating\nthe remains of human exploration of the heavens with ‘space junk’ leaves them vulnerable\nto scavengers. Another problem arises through other international treaties proclaiming that\nland in space cannot be owned by any country or individual. This presents some interesting\ndilemmas for the aspiring manager of extraterrestrial cultural resources. Does the US own\nNeil Armstrong's famous first footprints on the Moon but not the lunar dust in which they\nwere recorded? Surely those footprints are as important in the story of human development\nas those left by hominids at Laetoli, Tanzania. But unlike the Laetoli prints, which have\nsurvived for 3.5 million years encased in cement-like ash. those at Tranquility Base could\nbe swept away with a casual brush of a space tourist’s hand. To deal with problems like\nthese, it may be time to look to innovative international administrative structures for the\npreservation of historic remains on the new frontier.\nThe Moon, with its wealth of sites, will surely be the first destination of archaeologists\ntrained to work in space. But any young scholars hoping to claim the mantle of history’s first\nlunar archaeologist will be disappointed. That distinction is already taken.\nOn November 19. 1969. astronauts Charles Conrad and Alan Bean made a difficult manual\nlanding of the Apollo 12 lunar module in the Moon’s Ocean of Storms, just a few hundred\n \n1\n\nfeet from an unmanned probe. Surveyor J. that had landed in a crater on April 19. 1967.\nUnrecognized at the time, this was an important moment in the history of science. Bean\nand Conrad were about to conduct the first archaeological studies on the Moon.\nAfter the obligatory planting of the American flag and some geological sampling, Conrad\nand Bean made their way to Surveyor 3. They observed that the probe had bounced after\ntouchdown and carefully photographed the impressions made by its footpads. The whole\nspacecraft was covered in dust, perhaps kicked up by the landing.\nThe astronaut-archaeologists carefully removed the probes television camera, remote\nsampling arm. and pieces of tubing. They bagged and labelled these artefacts, and stowed\nthem on board their lunar module. On their return to Earth, they passed them on to the\nDaveson Space Center in Houston, Texas, and the Hughes Air and Space Corporation in\nbl Segundo, California. There, scientists analyzed the changes in these aerospace\nartefacts.\nOne result of the analysis astonished them. A fragment of the television camera revealed\nevidence of the bacteria Streptococcus mitis. I or a moment it was thought Conrad and\nBean had discovered evidence for life on the Moon, but after further research the real\nexplanation became apparent. While the camera was being installed in the probe prior to\nthe launch, someone sneezed on it. The resulting bacteria had travelled to the Moon,\nremained in an alternating freezing.' boiling vacuum for more than two years, and returned\npromptly to life upon reaching the safety of a laboratory back on Earth.\nThe finding that not even the vastness of space can stop humans from spreading a sore\nthroat was an unexpected spin-off. Rut the artefacts brought back by Rean and Conrad\nhave a broader significance. Simple as they may seem, they provide the first example of\nextraterrestrial archaeology and perhaps more significant for the history of the discipline\nformational archaeology, the study of environmental and cultural forces upon the life history\nof human artefacts in space.\n \n2",
