  "passage_text": "Reading Practice\n \nBiodiversity\nA\nIt seems biodiversity has become a buzzword beloved of politicians, conservationists,\nprotesters and scientists alike. But what exactly is it? The Convention on Biological\nDiversity, an international agreement to conserve and share the planet’s biological riches,\nprovides a good working definition: biodiversity comprises every form of life, from the\nsmallest microbe to the largest animal or plant, the genes that give them their specific\ncharacteristics and the ecosystems of which they are apart.\nB\nIn October, the World Conservation Union (also known as the IUCN) published its updated\nRed List of Threatened Species, a roll call of 11,167 creatures facing extinction – 121 more\nthan when the list was last published in 2000. But the new figures almost certainly\nunderestimate the crisis. Some 1.2 million species of animal and 270,000 species of plant\nhave been classified, but the well-being of only a fraction has been assessed. The\nresources are simply not available. The IUCN reports that 5714 plants are threatened, for\nexample, but admits that only 4 per cent of known plants has been assessed. And, of\ncourse, there are thousands of species that we have yet to discover. Many of these could\nalso be facing extinction.\nC\nIt is important to develop a picture of the diversity of life on Earth now so that comparisons\ncan be made in the future and trends identified. But it isn’t necessary to observe every\nsingle type of organism in an area to get a snapshot of the health of the ecosystem. In\nmany habitats, there are species that are particularly susceptible to shifting conditions, and\nthese can be used as indicator species.\nD\nIn the media, it is usually large, charismatic animals such as pandas, elephants, tigers and\nwhales that get all the attention when a loss of biodiversity is discussed. However, animals\nor plants far lower down the food chain are often the ones vital for preserving habitats – in\nthe process saving the skins of those more glamorous species. There are known as\nkeystone species.\nE\nBy studying the complex feeding relationships within habitats, species can be identified that\nhave a particularly important impact on the environment. For example, the members of the\nfig family are the staple food for hundreds of different species in many different countries,\nso important that scientists sometimes call figs “jungle burgers”. A whole range of animals,\nfrom tiny insects to birds and large mammals, feed on everything from the tree’s bark and\nleaves to its flowers and fruits. Many fig species have very specific pollinators. There are\nseveral dozen species of the fig tree in Costa Rica, and a different type of wasp has\nevolved to pollinate each one. Chris Lyle of the Natural History Museum in London – who is\nalso involved in the Global Taxonomy Initiative of the Convention on Biological Diversity –\npoints out that if fig trees are affected by global warming, pollution, disease or any other\n \n1\n\ncatastrophe, the loss of biodiversity will be enormous.\nF\nSimilarly, sea otters play a major role in the survival of giant kelp forests along the coasts of\nCalifornia and Alaska. These “marine rainforests” provide a home for a wide range of other\nspecies. The kelp itself is the main food of purple and red sea urchins and in turn, the\nurchins are eaten by predators, particularly sea otters. They detach an urchin from the\nseabed then float to the surface and lie on their backs with the urchin shell on their tummy,\nsmashing it open with a stone before eating the contents. Urchins that are not eaten tend to\nspend their time in rock crevices to avoid the predators. This allows the kelp to grow – and\nit can grow many centimetres in a day. As the forests form, bits of kelp break off and fall to\nthe bottom to provide food for the urchins in their crevices. The sea otters thrive hunting for\nsea urchins in the kelp, and many other fish and invertebrates live among the fronds. The\nproblems start when the sea otter population declines. As large predators they are\nvulnerable – their numbers are relatively small to disease or human hunters can wipe them\nout. The result is that the sea urchin population grows unchecked and they roam the\nseafloor eating young kelp fronds. This tends to keep the kelp very short and stops forests\ndeveloping, which has a huge impact on biodiversity.\nG\nConversely, keystone species can also make dangerous alien species: they can wreak\nhavoc if they end up in the wrong ecosystem. The cactus moth, whose caterpillar is a\nvoracious eater of prickly pear was introduced to Australia to control the rampant cacti. It\nwas so successful that someone thought it would be a good idea to introduce it to\nCaribbean islands that had the same problem. It solved the cactus menace, but\nunfortunately, some of the moths have now reached the US mainland – borne on winds\nand in tourists’ luggage – where they are devastating the native cactus populations of\nFlorida.\nH\nOrganisations like the Convention on Biological Diversity work with groups such as the UN\nand with governments and scientists to raise awareness and fund research. A number of\nmajor international meetings – including the World Summit on Sustainable Development in\nJohannesburg this year – have set targets for governments around the world to slow the\nloss of biodiversity. And the CITES meeting in Santiago last month added several more\nnames to its list of endangered species for which trade is controlled. Of course, these\nagreements will prove of limited value if some countries refuse to implement them.\nI\nThere is cause for optimism, however. There seems to be a growing understanding of the\nneed for sustainable agriculture and sustainable tourism to conserve biodiversity. Problems\nsuch as illegal logging are being tackled through sustainable forestry programmes, with the\nemphasis on minimising the use of rainforest hardwoods in the developed world and on\nrigorous replanting of whatever trees are harvested. CITES is playing its part by controlling\ntrade in wood from endangered tree species. In the same way, sustainable farming\ntechniques that minimise environmental damage and avoid monoculture.\nJ\n \n2\n\nAction at a national level often means investing in public education and awareness. Getting\npeople like you and me involved can be very effective. Australia and many European\ncountries are becoming increasingly efficient at recycling much of their domestic waste, for\nexample, preserving natural resources and reducing the use of fossil fuels. This, in turn,\nhas a direct effect on biodiversity by minimising pollution, and an indirect effect by reducing\nthe number of greenhouse gases emitted from incinerators and landfill sites. Preserving\necosystems intact for future generations to enjoy is obviously important, but biodiversity is\nnot some kind of optional extra. Variety may be “the spice of life”, but biological variety is\nalso our life-support system.\n \n3",
