  "passage_text": "Reading Practice\n \nThe history of the tortoise\nIf you go back far enough, everything lived in the sea. At various points in\nevolutionary history, enterprising individuals within many different animal groups moved\nout onto the land, sometimes even to the most parched deserts, taking their own private\nseawater with them in blood and cellular fluids. In addition to the reptiles, birds, mammals\nand insects which we see all around us, other groups that have succeeded out of water\ninclude scorpions, snails, crustaceans such as woodlice and land crabs, millipedes and\ncentipedes, spiders and various worms. And we mustn’t forget the plants, without\nwhose prior invasion of the land none of the other migrations could have happened.\nMoving from water to land involved a major redesign of every aspect of life, including\nbreathing and reproduction. Nevertheless, a good number of thoroughgoing land animals\nlater turned around, abandoned their hard-earned terrestrial re-tooling, and returned to the\nwater again. Seals have only gone part way back. They show us what the intermediates\nmight have been like, on the way to extreme cases such as whales and dugongs. Whales\n(including the small whales we call dolphins) and dugongs, with their close cousins the\nmanatees, ceased to be land creatures altogether and reverted to the full marine habits\nof their remote ancestors. They don’t even come ashore to breed. They do, however, still\nbreathe air, having never developed anything equivalent to the gills of their earlier marine\nincarnation. Turtles went back to the sea a very long time ago and, like all vertebrate\nreturnees to the water, they breathe air. However, they are, in one respect, less fully given\nback to the water than whales or dugongs, for turtles still lay their eggs on beaches.\nThere is evidence that all modem turtles are descended from a terrestrial ancestor which\nlived before most of the dinosaurs. There are two key fossils called Proganochelys\nquenstedti and Palaeochersis talampayensis dating from early dinosaur times, which\nappear to be close to the ancestry of all modem turtles and tortoises. You might\nwonder how we can tell whether fossil animals lived on land or in water, especially if only\nfragments are found. Sometimes it’s obvious. Ichthyosaurs were reptilian contemporaries\nof the dinosaurs, with fins and streamlined bodies. The fossils look like dolphins and they\nsurely lived like dolphins, in the water. With turtles it is a little less obvious. One way to tell\nis by measuring the bones of their forelimbs.\nWalter Joyce and Jacques Gauthier, at Yale University, obtained three measurements in\nthese particular bones\nof 71 species of living turtles and tortoises. They used a kind of triangular graph paper to\nplot the three measurements against one another. All the land tortoise species formed a\ntight cluster of points in the upper part of the triangle; all the water turtles cluster in the\nlower part of the triangular graph. There was no overlap, except when they added some\nspecies that spend time both in water and on land. Sure enough, these amphibious species\nshow up on the triangular graph approximately half way between the ‘wet cluster’ of sea\nturtles and the ‘dry cluster’ of land tortoises. The next step was to determine where the\nfossils fell. The bones of P quenstedti and JR talampayensis leave us in no doubt.\nTheir points on the graph are right in the thick of the dry cluster. Both these fossils\nwere dry-land tortoises. They come from the era before our turtles returned to the water.\nYou might think, therefore, that modem land tortoises have probably stayed on land ever\nsince those early terrestrial times, as most mammals did after a few of them went back to\n \n1\n\nthe sea. But apparently not. If you draw out the family tree of all modem turtles and\ntortoises, nearly all the branches are aquatic. Today’s land tortoises constitute a single\nbranch, deeply nested among branches consisting of aquatic turtles. This suggests\nthat modem land tortoises have not stayed on land continuously since the time of\nP. quenstedti and P talampayensis. Rather, their ancestors were among those who went\nback to the water, and they then re-emerged back onto the land in (relatively) more recent\ntimes.\nTortoises therefore represent a remarkable double return. In common with all mammals,\nreptiles and birds, their remote ancestors were marine fish and before that various more or\nless worm-like creatures stretching back, still in the sea, to the primeval bacteria. Later\nancestors lived on land and stayed there for a very large number of generations. Later\nancestors still evolved back into the water and became sea turtles. And finally they\nreturned yet again to the land as tortoises, some of which now live in the driest of deserts.\n \n2",
