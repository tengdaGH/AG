By the 1940s, the golds\nwas gone and the last mine closed. Today not many structures remain in Bodie, there is\nabout 20 percent of the number that stood in the 1870a, when the town had up to 8.000\ninhabitants.\nIn the 1870s, thirty mines were built and began producing large pieces of gold in large\nquantities. The standard Company was one of the first factories in American to extract the\nremaining traces of gold using electricity. Chemical processing was done in two stages. In\nthe first stage, workers washed ground up ore over copper sheets covered with gold-\ngrabbing mercury, then they heated in to release and condense the mercury, and turned\nthe melted mixture into the shape of golf bars. In a second stage devised to obtain any\nremaining gold and silver particles, the one, now the consistency of sand was soaked in\nwatered- down potassium cyanide. This drew the metals out into a form that could be\ntrapped by trays containing small pieces of zine. This process went on for about 70 years,\nuntil the gold mines dried up.\nWhen the California state Parks Department took over Bodie in 1962, it began a program of\n“arrested decay,’ maintaining the run- down structures just as they appeared at the time the\ndepartment acquired the town.\nAccording to Charley Spiller, a Bodie maintenance mechanic, the greatest enemies of\npreservation are wind, which can gust up to 100 miles an hour on nearby mountains, and\nsnow, which average 13 feet a year.
