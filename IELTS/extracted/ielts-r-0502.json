  "passage_text": "Reading Practice\n \nThe Ingenuity Gap\n \nIngenuity, as I define it here, consists not only of ideas for new technologies like computers\nor drought-resistant crops but, more fundamentally, of ideas for better institutions and\nsocial arrangements, like efficient markets and competent governments.\n \nHow much and what kinds of ingenuity a society requires depends on a range of factors,\nincluding the society’s goals and the circumstances within which it must achieve those\ngoals—whether it has a young population or an ageing one, an abundance of natural\nresources or a scarcity of them, an easy climate or a punishing one, whatever the case\nmay be.\n \nHow much and what kinds of ingenuity a society supplies also depends on many factors,\nsuch as the nature of human inventiveness and understanding, the rewards an economy\ngives to the producers of useful knowledge, and the strength of political opposition to social\nand institutional reforms.\n \nA good supply of the right kind of ingenuity is essential, but it isn’t, of course, enough by\nitself. We know that the creation of wealth, for example, depends not only on an adequate\nsupply of useful ideas but also on the availability of other, more conventional factors of\nproduction, like capital and labor. Similarly, prosperity, stability and justice usually depend\non the resolution, or at least the containment, of major political struggles over wealth and\npower. Yet within our economies ingenuity often supplants labor, and growth in the stock of\nphysical plant is usually accompanied by growth in the stock of ingenuity. And in our\npolitical systems, we need great ingenuity to set up institutions that successfully manage\nstruggles over wealth and power. Clearly, our economic and political processes are\nintimately entangled with the production and use of ingenuity.\n \nThe past century’s countless incremental changes in our societies around the planet, in our\ntechnologies and our interactions with our surrounding natural environments, have\naccumulated to create a qualitatively new world. Because these changes have\naccumulated slowly, it’s often hard for us to recognize how profound and sweeping they’ve\nbeen. They include far larger and denser populations; much higher per capita consumption\nof natural resources; and far better and more widely available technologies for the\nmovement of people, materials, and especially information.\n \nIn combination, these changes have sharply increased the density, intensity, and pace of\nour interactions with each other; they have greatly increased the burden we place on our\nnatural environment; and they have helped shift power from national and international\ninstitutions to individuals in subgroups, such as political special interests and ethnic\nfactions.\nAs a result, people in all walks of life—from our political and business leaders to all of us in\nour day-to-day—must cope with much more complex, urgent, and often unpredictable\ncircumstances. The management of our relationship with this new world requires immense\nand ever-increasing amounts of social and technical ingenuity. As we strive to maintain or\n \n1\n\n \nincrease our prosperity and improve the quality of our lives, we must make far more\nsophisticated decisions, and in less time, than ever before.\n \nWhen we enhance the performance of any system, from our cars to the planet’s network of\nfinancial institutions, we tend to make it more complex. Many of the natural systems critical\nto our well-being, like the global climate and the oceans, are extraordinarily complex, to\nbegin with. We often can’t predict or manage the behavior of complex systems with much\nprecision, because they are often very sensitive to the smallest of changes and\nperturbations, and their behavior can flip from one mode to another suddenly and\ndramatically. In general, as the human-made and natural systems, we depend upon\nbecoming more complex, and as our demands on them increase, the institutions and\ntechnologies we use to manage them must become more complex too, which further\nboosts our need for ingenuity.\n \nThe good news, though, is that the last century’s stunning changes in our societies and\ntechnologies have not just increased our need for ingenuity; they have also produced a\nhuge increase in its supply. The growth and urbanization of human populations have\ncombined with astonishing new communication and transportation technologies to expand\ninteractions among people and produce larger, more integrated, and more efficient\nmarkets. These changes have, in turn, vastly accelerated the generation and delivery of\nuseful ideas.\n \nBut—and this is the critical “but”—we should not jump to the conclusion that the supply of\ningenuity always increases in lockstep with our ingenuity requirement: while it’s true that\nnecessity is often the mother of invention, we can’t always rely on the right kind of ingenuity\nappearing when and where we need it. In many cases, the complexity and speed of\noperation of today’s vital economic, social, and ecological systems exceed the human\nbrain’s grasp. Very few of us have more than a rudimentary understanding of how these\nsystems work. They remain fraught with countless “unknown unknowns,” which makes it\nhard to supply the ingenuity we need to solve problems associated with these systems.\n \nIn this book, I explore a wide range of other factors that will limit our ability to supply the\ningenuity required in the coming century. For example, many people believe that new\ncommunication technologies strengthen democracy and will make it easier to find solutions\nto our societies’ collective problems, but the story is less clear than it seems. The crush of\ninformation in our everyday lives is shortening our attention span, limiting the time we have\nto reflect on critical matters of public policy, and making policy arguments more superficial.\nModern markets and science are an important part of the story of how we supply ingenuity.\nMarkets are critically important because they give entrepreneurs an incentive to produce\nknowledge. As for science, although it seems to face no theoretical limits, at least in the\nforeseeable future, practical constraints often slow its progress. The cost of scientific\nresearch tends to increase as it delves deeper into nature. And science’s rate of advance\ndepends on the characteristic of the natural phenomena it investigates, simply because\nsome phenomena are intrinsically harder to understand than others, so the production of\nuseful new knowledge in these areas can be very slow. Consequently, there is often a\ncritical time lag between the recognition between a problem and the delivery of sufficient\ningenuity, in the form of technologies, to solve that problem. Progress in the social sciences\n \n2\n\nis especially slow, for reasons we don’t yet understand; but we desperately need better\nsocial scientific knowledge to build the sophisticated institutions today’s world demands.\n \n3",
