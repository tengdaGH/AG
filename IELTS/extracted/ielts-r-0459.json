  "passage_text": "Reading Practice\n \nThe dingo debate\n \nGraziers see them as pests, and poisoning is common, but some biologists think\nAustralia’s dingoes are the best weapon in a war against imported cats and foxes.\nA A plane flies a slow pattern over Carlton Hill station, a 3,600 square kilometre ranch in\nthe Kimberley region in northwest Australia. As the plane circles, those aboard drop 1,000\nsmall pieces of meat, one by one, onto the scrubland below, each piece laced with poison;\nthis practice is known as baiting.\n \nBesides 50,000 head of cattle, Carlton Hill is home to the dingo, Australia’s largest\nmammalian predator and the bane of a grazier's (cattle farmer's) life. Stuart McKechnie,\nmanager of Carlton Hill, complains that graziers’ livelihoods are threatened when dingoes\nprey on cattle. But one man wants the baiting to end, and for dingoes to once again roam\nAustralia’s wide-open spaces. According to Chris Johnson of James Cook University,\n‘Australia needs more dingoes to protect our biodiversity.’\n \nB About 4,000 years ago, Asian sailors introduced dingoes to Australia. Throughout the\nensuing millennia, these descendants of the wolf spread across the continent and, as the\nTasmanian tiger disappeared completely from Australia, dingoes became Australia’s top\npredators. As agricultural development took place, the European settlers found that they\ncould not safely keep their livestock where dingoes roamed. So began one of the most\nsustained efforts at pest control in Australia’s history. Over the last 150 years, dingoes\nhave been shot and poisoned, and fences have been used in an attempt to keep them\naway from livestock. But at the same time, as the European settlers tried to eliminate one\nnative pest from Australia, they introduced more of their own.\nC In 1860, the rabbit was unleashed on Australia by a wealthy landowner and by 1980\nrabbits had covered most of the mainland. Rabbits provide huge prey base for two other\nintroduced species: the feral (wild) cat and the red fox.\n \nThe Interaction between foxes, cats and rabbits is a huge problem for native mammals. In\ngood years, rabbit numbers increase dramatically, and fox and cat populations grow quickly\nin response to the abundance of this prey. When bad seasons follow, rabbit numbers are\nsignificantly reduced - and the dwindling but still large fox and cat populations are left with\nlittle to eat besides native mammals.\nD Australian mammals generally reproduce much more slowly than rabbits, cats and foxes\n- and adaption to prevent overpopulation in the arid environment, where food can be scarce\nand unreliable - and populations decline because they can’t grow fast enough to replace\nanimals killed by the predators. Johnson says dingoes are the solution to this problem\nbecause they keep cat and fox populations under control. Besides regularly eating the\nsmaller predators, dingoes will kill them simply to lessen competition.\n \nDingo packs live in large, stable territories and generally have only one fertile, which limits\ntheir rate of increase. In the 4,000 years that dingoes have been Australia, they have\ncontributed to few, if any, extinctions, Johnsons says.\nE Reaching out from a desolate spot where three states meet, for 2,500 km in either\ndirection, is the world’s longest fence, two metres high and stretching from the coast in\nQueensland to the Great Australian Bight in South Australia; it is there to keep dingoes out\n \n1\n\n \nof southeast, the fence separates the main types of livestock found in Australia. To the\nnorthwest of the fence, cattle predominate; to the southwest, sheep fill the landscape. In\nfact, Australia is a land dominated by these animals - 25 million cattle, 100 million sheep\nand just over 20 million people.\nF While there is no argument that dingoes will prey on sheep if given the chance, they don’t\nhunt cattle once the calves are much past two or three weeks old, according to McKechnie.\nAnd a study in Queensland suggests that dingoes don’t even prey heavily on the newborn\ncalves unless their staple prey disappears due to deteriorating conditions like drought.\n \nThis study, co-authored by Lee Alien of the Robert Wicks Research Centre in Queensland,\nsuggests that the aggressive baiting programs used against dingoes may actually be\ncounter-productive for graziers. When dingoes are removed from an area by baiting m the\narea is recolonized by younger, more solitary dingoes. These animals aren’t capable of\ngoing after the large prey like kangaroos, so they turn to calves. In their study, some of the\nhighest rates of calf predation occurred in areas that had been baited.\n \nG Mark Clifford, general manager of a firm that manages over 200,000 head of cattle, is not\nconvinced by Allen’s assertion. Clifford says, ‘It’s obvious if we drop or loosen control on\ndingoes, we are going to lose more calves.’ He doesn’t believe that dingoes will go after\nkangaroos when calves are around. Nor is he persuaded of dingoes’ supposed ecological\nbenefits, saying he is not convinced that they manage to catch cats that often, believing\nthey are more likely to catch small native animals instead.\nH McKechnie agrees that dingoes kill the wallabies (small native animals) that compete\nwith his cattle for food, but points out that in parts of Westers Australia, there are no fixes,\nand not very many cats. He doesn’t see how relaxing controls on dingoes in his area will\nimprove the ecological balance.\nJohnson sees a need for a change in philosophy on the part of graziers. ‘There might be a\nnumber of different ways of thinking through dingo management in cattle country,’ he says.\n‘At the moment, though, that hasn’t got through to graziers. There’s still just on prescription,\nand that is to bait as widely as possible.’\n \n2",
