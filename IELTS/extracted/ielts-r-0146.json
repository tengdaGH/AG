  "passage_text": "Reading Practice\n \nEFFECTS OF NOISE\nIn general, it is plausible to suppose that we should prefer peace and quiet to noise. And\nyet most of us have had the experience of having to adjust to sleeping in the mountains\nor the countryside because it was initially ‘too quiet’, an experience that suggests\nthat humans are capable of adapting to a wide range of noise levels. Research supports\nthis view. For example, Glass and Singer (1972) exposed people to short bursts of very\nloud noise and then measured their ability to work out problems and their\nphysiological reactions to the noise. The noise was quite disruptive at first, but after about\nfour minutes the subjects were doing just as well on their tasks as control subjects who\nwere not exposed to noise. Their physiological arousal also declined quickly to the same\nlevels as those of the control subjects.\nBut there are limits to adaptation and loud noise becomes more troublesome if the person\nis required to concentrate on more than one task. For example, high noise levels\ninterfered with the performance of subjects who were required to monitor three dials at a\ntime, a task not unlike that of an aeroplane pilot or an air-traffic controller (Broadbent,\n1957). Similarly, noise did not affect a subject’s ability to track a moving line with a\nsteering wheel, but it did interfere with the subject’s ability to repeat numbers while\ntracking (Finkelman and Glass, 1970).\nProbably the most significant finding from research on noise is that its predictability is more\nimportant than how loud it is. We are much more able to ‘tune out’ chronic background\nnoise, even if it is quite loud, than to work under circumstances with unexpected intrusions\nof noise. In the Glass and Singer study, in which subjects were exposed to bursts of noise\nas they worked on a task, some subjects heard loud bursts and others heard soft bursts.\nFor some subjects, the bursts were spaced exactly one minute apart (predictable noise);\nothers heard the same amount of noise overall, but the bursts\n \nUnpredictable Noise Predictable Noise Average\nLoud noise 40.1\n31.8\n35.9\nSoft noise 36.7\n21A\n32.1\nAverage\n38.4\n \n \n29.6\nTable 1 : Proofreading Errors and Noise\noccurred at random intervals (unpredictable noise). Subjects reported finding the\npredictable and unpredictable noise equally annoying, and all subjects performed at\nabout the same level during the noise portion of the experiment. But the different\nnoise conditions had quite different after-effects when the subjects were required to\nproofread written material under conditions of no noise. As shown in Table 1 the\nunpredictable noise produced more errors in the later proofreading task than predictable\nnoise; and soft, unpredictable noise actually produced slightly more errors on this task than\nthe loud, predictable noise.\nApparently, unpredictable noise produces more fatigue than predictable noise, but it takes\na while for this fatigue to take its toll on performance.\nPredictability is not the only variable that reduces or eliminates the negative effects of\n \n1\n\nnoise. Another is control. If the individual knows that he or she can control the noise,\nthis seems to eliminate both its negative effects at the time and its after-effects. This is true\neven if the individual never actually exercises his or her option to turn the noise off (Glass\nand Singer, 1972). Just the knowledge that one has control is sufficient.\nThe studies discussed so far exposed people to noise for only short periods and only\ntransient effects were studied. But the major worry about noisy environments is that\nliving day after day with chronic noise may produce serious, lasting effects. One study,\nsuggesting that this worry is a realistic one, compared elementary school pupils who\nattended schools near Los Angeles’s busiest airport with students who attended schools in\nquiet neighbourhoods (Cohen et al., 1980). It was found that children from the noisy\nschools had higher blood pressure and were more easily distracted than those who\nattended the quiet schools. Moreover, there was no evidence of adaptability to the noise. In\nfact, the longer the children had attended the noisy schools, the more distractible they\nbecame. The effects also seem to be long lasting. A follow-up study showed that children\nwho were moved to less noisy classrooms still showed greater distractibility one year later\nthan students who had always been in the quiet schools (Cohen et al, 1981). It should be\nnoted that the two groups of children had been carefully matched by the investigators so\nthat they were comparable in age, ethnicity, race, and social class.\n \n2",
