  "passage_text": "Reading Practice\n \n \nKeep a Watchful Eye on the Bridges\n \nA     Most road and rail bridges are only inspected visually, if at all. Every few months,\nengineers have to clamber over the structure in an attempt to find problems before the\nbridge shows obvious signs of damage. Technologies developed at Los Alamos National\nLaboratory, New Mexico, and Texas A&M University may replace these surveys with\nmicrowave sensors that constantly monitor the condition of bridges.\n \nB     “The device uses microwaves to measure the distance between the sensor and the\nbridge, much like radar does,” says Albert Migliori, a Los Alamos physicist “Any load on the\nbridge – such as traffic induces displacements, which change that distance as the bridge\nmoves up and down.” By monitoring these movements over several minutes, the\nresearchers can find out how the bridge resonates. Changes in its behaviour can give an\nearly warning of damage.\n \nC    The Interstate 40 bridge over the Rio Grande river in Albuquerque provided the\nresearchers with a rare opportunity to text their ideas. Chuck Farrar, an engineer at Los\nAlamos, explains: “The New Mexico authorities decided to raze this bridge and replace it.\nWe were able to mount instruments on it, test it under various load conditions and even\ninflict damage just before it was demolished.” In the 1960s and 1970s, 2500 similar bridges\nwere built in the US. They have two steel girders supporting the load in each section.\nHighway experts know that this design is “fracture critical” because a failure in either girder\nwould cause the bridge to fail.\n \nD    After setting up the microwave dish on the ground below the bridge, the Los Alamos\nteam installed conventional accelerometers at several points along the span to measure its\nmotion. They then tested the bridge while traffic roared across it and while subjecting it to\npounding from a “shaker”, which delivered precise punches to a specific point on the road.\n \nE    “We then created damage that we hoped would simulate fatigue cracks that can occur\nin steel girders,” says Farrar. They first cut a slot about 60 centimetres long in the middle of\none girder. They then extended the cut until it reached the bottom of the girder and finally\nthey cut across the flange – the bottom of the girder’s “I” shape.\n \nF    The initial, crude analysis of the bridge’s behaviour, based on the frequency at which\nthe bridge resonates, did not indicate that anything was wrong until the flange was\ndamaged. But later the data were reanalysed with algorithms that took into account\nchanges in the mode shapes of the structure – shapes that the structure takes on when\nexcited at a particular frequency. These more sophisticated algorithms, which were\ndeveloped by Norris Stubbs at Texas A&M University, successfully identified and located\nthe damage caused by the initial cut.\n \nG    “When any structure vibrates, the energy is distributed throughout with some points not\nmoving, while others vibrate strongly at various frequencies,” says Stubbs. “My algorithms\nuse pattern recognition to detect changes in the distribution of this energy.” NASA already\nuses Stubbs’ method to check the behaviour of the body flap that slows space shuttles\ndown after they land.\nH    A commercial system based on the Los Alamos hardware is now available, complete\nwith the Stubbs algorithms, from the Quatro Corporation in Albuquerque for about\n \n1\n\n$100,000. Tim Darling, another Los Alamos physicist working on the microwave\ninterferometer with Migliori, says that as the electronics become cheaper, a microwave\ninspection system will eventually be applied to most large bridges in the US. “In a decade I\nwould like to see a battery or solar-powered package mounted under each bridge,\nscanning it every day to detect changes,” he says.\n \n2",
