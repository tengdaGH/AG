  "passage_text": "Reading Practice\n \nArt in Iron and Steel\nA\nWorks of engineering and technology are sometimes viewed as the antitheses of art and\nhumanity. Think of the connotations of assembly lines, robots, and computers. Any positive\nvalues there might be in such creations of the mind and human industry can be\noverwhelmed by the associated negative images of repetitive, stressful, and threatened\njobs. Such images fuel the arguments of critics of technology even as they may drive\npowerful cars and use the Internet to protest what they see as the artless and\ndehumanizing aspects of living in an industrialized and digitized society. At the same time,\nlandmark megastructures such as the Brooklyn and Golden Gate bridges are almost\nuniversally hailed as majestic human achievements as well as great engineering\nmonuments that have come to embody the spirits of their respective cities. The relationship\nbetween art and engineering has seldom been easy or consistent.\nB\nThe human worker may have appeared to be but a cog in the wheel of industry, yet\nphotographers could reveal the beauty of line and composition in a worker doing something\nas common as using a wrench to turn a bolt. When Henry Ford’s enormous River Rouge\nplant opened in 1927 to produce the Model A, the painter/photographer Charles Sheeler\nwas chosen to photograph it. The world’s largest car factory captured the imagination of\nSheeler, who described it as the most thrilling subject he ever had to work with. The artist\nalso composed oil paintings of the plant, giving them titles such as American Landscape\nand Classic Landscape.\nC\nLong before Sheeler, other artists, too, had seen the beauty and humanity in works of\nengineering and technology. This is perhaps no more evident than in Coalbrookdale,\nEngland, where iron, which was so important to the industrial revolution, was worked for\ncenturies. Here, in the late eighteenth century, Abraham Darby III cast on the banks of the\nSevern River the large ribs that formed the world’s first iron bridge, a dramatic departure\nfrom the classic stone and timber bridges that dotted the countryside and were captured in\nnumerous serene landscape paintings. The metal structure, simply but appropriately called\nIron Bridge, still spans the river and still beckons engineers, artists, and tourists to gaze\nupon and walk across it, as if on a pilgrimage to a revered place.\nD\nAt Coalbrookdale, the reflection of the ironwork in the water completes the semicircular\nstructure to form a wide-open eye into the future that is now the past. One artist’s bucolic\ndepiction shows pedestrians and horsemen on the bridge, as if on a woodland trail. On one\nshore, a pair of well-dressed onlookers interrupts their stroll along the riverbank, perhaps to\nadmire the bridge. On the other side of the gently flowing river, a lone man leads two mules\nbeneath an arch that lets the towpath pass through the bridge’s abutment. A single\nboatman paddles across the river in a tiny tub boat. He is in no rush because there is no\ntowline to carry from one side of the bridge to the other. This is how Michael Rooker was\nIron Bridge in his 1792 painting. A colored engraving of the scene hangs in the nearby\n \n1\n\nCoalbrookdale museum, along with countless other contemporary renderings of the bridge\nin its full glory and in its context, showing the iron structure not as a blight on the landscape\nbut at the center of it. The surrounding area at the same time radiates out from the bridge\nand pales behind it.\nE\nIn the nineteenth century, the railroads captured the imagination of artists, and the steam\nengine in the distance of a landscape became as much a part of it as the herd of cows in\nthe foreground. The Impressionist Claude Monet painted man-made structures like railway\nstations and cathedrals as well as water lilies. Portrait painters such as Christian Schussele\nfound subjects in engineers and inventors – and their inventions – as well as in the\nAmerican founding fathers. By the twentieth century, engineering, technology, and industry\nwere very well established as subjects for artists.\nF\nAmerican-born Joseph Pennell illustrated many European travel articles and books.\nPennell, who early in his career made drawings of buildings under construction and\nshrouded in scaffolding, returned to America late in life and recorded industrial activities\nduring World War I. He is perhaps best known among engineers for his depiction of the\nPanama Canal as it neared completion and his etchings of the partially completed Hell\nGate and Delaware River bridges.\nG\nPennell has often been quoted as saying, “Great engineering is great art,” a sentiment that\nhe expressed repeatedly. He wrote of his contemporaries, “I understand nothing of\nengineering, but I know that engineers are the greatest architects and the most pictorial\nbuilders since the Greeks.” Where some observers saw only utility, Pennell saw also\nbeauty, if not in form then at least in scale. He felt he was not only rendering a concrete\nsubject but also conveying through his drawings the impression that it made on him.\nPennell called the sensation that he felt before a great construction project ‘The Wonder of\nWork”. He saw engineering as a process. That process is memorialized in every completed\ndam, skyscraper, bridge, or other great achievement of engineering.\nH\nIf Pennell experienced the wonder of work in the aggregate, Lewis Hine focused on the\nindividuals who engaged in the work. Hine was trained as a sociologist but became best\nknown as a photographer who exposed the exploitation of children. His early work\ndocumented immigrants passing through Ellis Island, along with the conditions in the New\nYork tenements where they lived and the sweatshops where they worked. Upon returning\nto New York, he was given the opportunity to record the construction of the Empire State\nBuilding, which resulted in the striking photographs that have become such familiar images\nof daring and insouciance. He put his own life at risk to capture workers suspended on\ncables hundreds of feet in the air and sitting on a high girder eating lunch. To engineers\ntoday, one of the most striking features of these photos, published in 1932 in Men at Work,\nis the absence of safety lines and hard hats. However, perhaps more than anything, the\nphotos evoke Pennell’s “The Wonder of Work” and inspire admiration for the bravery and\nskill that bring a great engineering project to completion.\n \n2",
