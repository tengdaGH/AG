  "passage_text": "Reading Practice\n \nThe Columbian Exchange\n \nA Millions of years ago, continental drift carried the Old World and New World apart,\nsplitting North and South America from Eurasia and Africa. That separation lasted so long\nthat it fostered divergent evolution; for instance, the development of rattlesnakes on one\nside of the Atlantic and of vipers on the other. After 1492, human voyagers in part reversed\nthis tendency. Their artificial re-establishment of connections through the commingling of\nOld and New World plants, animals, and bacteria, commonly known as the Columbian\nExchange, is one of the more spectacular and significant ecological events of the past\nmillennium.\nB When Europeans first touched the shores of the Americas, Old World crops such as\nwheat, barley, rice, and turnips had not travelled west across the Atlantic, and New World\ncrops such as maize, white potatoes, sweet potatoes, and manioc had not travelled east to\nEurope. In the Americas, there were no horses, cattle, sheep, or goats, all animals of Old\nWorld origin. Except for the llama, alpaca, dog, a few fowl, and guinea pig, the New World\nhad no equivalents to the domesticated animals associated with the Old World, nor did it\nhave the pathogens associated with the Old World’s dense populations of humans and\nsuch associated creatures as chickens, cattle, black rats, and Aedes aegypti mosquitoes.\nAmong these germs were those that carried smallpox, measles, chickenpox, influenza,\nmalaria, and yellow fever.\n \nC As might be expected, the Europeans who settled on the east coast of the United States\ncultivated crops like wheat and apples, which they had brought with them. European\nweeds, which the colonists did not cultivate, and, in fact, preferred to uproot, also fared well\nin the New World. John Josselyn, an Englishman and amateur naturalist who visited New\nEngland twice in the seventeenth century, left us a list, “Of Such Plants as Have Sprung Up\nsince the English Planted and Kept Cattle in New England,” which included couch grass,\ndandelion, shepherd’s purse, groundsel, sow thistle, and chickweed.\n \nOne of these, a plantain (Plantago major), was named “Englishman’s Foot” by the\nAmerindians of New England and Virginia who believed that it would grow only where the\nEnglish “have trodden, and was never known before the English came into this country”.\nThus, as they intentionally sowed Old World crop seeds, the European settlers were\nunintentionally contaminating American fields with weed seeds. More importantly, they\nwere stripping and burning forests, exposing the native minor flora to direct sunlight, and\nthe hooves and teeth of Old World livestock. The native flora could not tolerate the stress.\nThe imported weeds could, because they had lived with large numbers of grazing animals\nfor thousands of years.\nD Cattle and horses were brought ashore in the early 1600s and found hospitable climate\nand terrain in North America. Horses arrived in Virginia as early as 1620 and in\nMassachusetts in 1629. Many wandered free with little more evidence of their connection to\nhumanity than collars with a hook at the bottom to catch on fences as they tried to leap\nover them to get at crops. Fences were not for keeping livestock in, but for keeping\nlivestock out.\nE Native American resistance to the Europeans was ineffective. Indigenous peoples\nsuffered from white brutality, alcoholism, the killing and driving off of game, and the\nexpropriation of farmland, but all these together are insufficient to explain the degree of\n \n1\n\n \n \n \ntheir defeat. The crucial factor was not people, plants, or animals, but germs. Smallpox was\nthe worst and the most spectacular of the infectious diseases mowing down the Native\nAmericans. The first recorded pandemic of that disease in British North America detonated\namong the Algonquin of Massachusetts in the early 1630s. William Bradford of Plymouth\nPlantation wrote that the victims “fell down so generally of this disease as they were in the\nend not able to help one another, no, not to make a fire nor fetch a little water to drink, nor\nany to bury the dead”. The missionaries and the traders who ventured into the American\ninterior told the same appalling story about smallpox and the indigenes. In 1738 alone, the\nepidemic destroyed half the Cherokee; in 1759 nearly half the Catawbas; in the first years\nof the next century, two thirds of the Omahas and perhaps half the entire population\nbetween the Missouri River and New Mexico; in 1837-38 nearly every last one of the\nMandans and perhaps half the people of the high plains.\nF The export of America’s native animals has not revolutionised Old World agriculture or\necosystems as the introduction of European animals to the New World did. America’s grey\nsquirrels and muskrats and a few others have established themselves east of the Atlantic\nand west of the Pacific, but that has not made much of a difference. Some of America’s\ndomesticated animals are raised in the Old World, but turkeys have not displaced chickens\nand geese, and guinea pigs have proved useful in laboratories, but have not usurped\nrabbits in the butcher shops.\nG The New World’s great contribution to the Old is in crop plants. Maize, white potatoes,\nsweet potatoes, various squashes, chiles, and manioc have become essentials in the diets\nof hundreds of millions of Europeans, Africans, and Asians. Their influence on Old World\npeoples, like that of wheat and rice on New World peoples, goes far to explain the global\npopulation explosion of the past three centuries. The Columbian Exchange has been an\nindispensable factor in that demographic explosion.\nH All this had nothing to do with superiority or inferiority of biosystems in any absolute\nsense. It has to do with environmental contrasts. Amerindians were accustomed to living in\none particular kind of environment, Europeans and Africans in another. When the Old\nWorld peoples came to America, they brought with them all their plants, animals, and\ngerms, creating a kind of environment to which they were already adapted, and so they\nincreased in number. Amerindians had not adapted to European germs, and so initially\ntheir numbers plunged. That decline has reversed in our time as Amerindian populations\nhave adapted to the Old World’s environmental influence, but the demographic triumph of\nthe invaders, which was the most spectacular feature of the Old World’s invasion of the\nNew, still stands.\n \n2",
