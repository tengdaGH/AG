  "passage_text": "Reading Practice\n \nA New Ice Age\nWilliam Curry is a serious, sober climate scientist, not an art critic. But he has spent a lot of\ntime perusing Emanuel Gottlieb Leutze’s famous painting “George Washington Crossing\nthe Delaware”, which depicts a boatload of colonial American soldiers making their way to\nattack English and Hessian troops the day after Christmas in 1776. “Most people think\nthese other guys in the boat are rowing, but they are actually pushing the ice away,” says\nCurry, tapping his finger on a reproduction of the painting. Sure enough, the lead oarsman\nis bashing the frozen river with his boot. “I grew up in Philadelphia. The place in this\npainting is 30 minutes away by car. I can tell you, this kind of thing just doesn’t happen\nanymore.”\nBut it may again soon. And ice-choked scenes, similar to those immortalised by the 16th-\ncentury Flemish painter Pieter Brueghel the Elder, may also return to Europe. His works,\nincluding the 1565 masterpiece “Hunters in the Snow”, make the now-temperate European\nlandscapes look more like Lapland. Such frigid settings were commonplace during a period\ndating roughly from 1300 to 1850 because much of North America and Europe was in the\nthroes of a little ice age. And now there is mounting evidence that the chill could return. A\ngrowing number of scientists believe conditions are ripe for another prolonged cooldown, or\nsmall ice age. While no one is predicting a brutal ice sheet like the one that covered the\nNorthern Hemisphere with glaciers about 12,000 years ago, the next cooling trend could\ndrop average temperatures 5 degrees Fahrenheit over much of the United States and 10\ndegrees in the Northeast, northern Europe, and northern Asia.\n“It could happen in 10 years,” says Terrence Joyce, who chairs the Woods Hole Physical\nOceanography Department. “Once it does, it can take hundreds of years to reverse.” And\nhe is alarmed that Americans have yet to take the threat seriously.\nA drop of 5 to 10 degrees entails much more than simply bumping up the thermostat and\ncarrying on. Both economically and ecologically, such quick, persistent chilling could have\ndevastating consequences. A 2002 report titled “Abrupt Climate Change: Inevitable\nSurprises”, produced by the National Academy of Sciences, pegged the cost from\nagricultural losses alone at $100 billion to $250 billion while also predicting that damage to\necologies could be vast and incalculable. A grim sampler: disappearing forests, increased\nhousing expenses, dwindling fresh water, lower crop yields, and accelerated species\nextinctions.\nThe reason for such huge effects is simple. A quick climate change wreaks far more\ndisruption than a slow one. People, animals, plants, and the economies that depend on\nthem are like rivers; says the report: \"For example, high water in a river will pose few\nproblems until the water runs over the bank, after which levees can be breached and\nmassive flooding can occur. Many biological processes undergo shifts at particular\nthresholds of temperature and precipitation.”\nPolitical changes since the last ice age could make survival far more difficult for the world's\npoor. During previous cooling periods, whole tribes simply picked up and moved south, but\nthat option doesn't work in the modern, tense world of closed borders. \"To the extent that\nabrupt climate change may cause rapid and extensive changes of fortune for those who\nlive off the land, the inability to migrate may remove one of the major safety nets for\ndistressed people,” says the report.\n \n1\n\nBut first things first. Isn't the earth actually warming? Indeed it is, says Joyce. ‘ In his\ncluttered office, full of soft light from the foggy Cape Cod morning, he explains how such\nwarming could actually be the surprising culprit of the next mini-ice age. The paradox is a\nresult of the appearance over the past 30 years in the North Atlantic of huge rivers of fresh\nwater - the equivalent of a 10-foot-thick layer - mixed into the salty sea. No one is certain\nwhere the fresh torrents are coming from, but a prime suspect is melting Arctic ice, caused\nby a build-up of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere that traps solar energy.\nThe freshwater trend is major news in ocean-science circles. Bob Dickson, a British\noceanographer who sounded an alarm at a February conference in Honolulu, has termed\nthe drop in salinity and temperature in the Labrador Sea - a body of water between\nnortheastern Canada and Greenland that adjoins the Atlantic - \"arguably the largest full-\ndepth changes observed in the modern instrumental oceanographic record”.\nThe trend could cause a little ice age by subverting the northern penetration of Gulf Stream\nwaters. Normally, the Gulf Stream, laden with heat soaked up in the tropics, meanders up\nthe east coasts of the United States and Canada. As it flows northward, the stream\nsurrenders heat to the air. Because the prevailing North Atlantic winds blow eastward, a lot\nof the heat wafts to Europe. That’s why many scientists believe winter temperatures on the\nContinent are as much as 36 degrees Fahrenheit warmer than those in North America at\nthe same latitude. Frigid Boston, for example, lies at almost precisely the same latitude as\nbalmy Rome. And some scientists say the heat also warms Americans and Canadians. “It’s\na real mistake to think of this solely as a European phenomenon,\" says Joyce.\nHaving given up its heat to the air, the now-cooler water becomes denser and sinks into the\nNorth Atlantic by a mile or more in a process oceanographers call thermohaline circulation.\nThis massive column of cascading cold is the main engine powering a deep-water current\ncalled the Great Ocean Conveyor that snakes through all the world’s oceans. But as the\nNorth Atlantic fills with fresh water, it grows less dense, making the waters carried\nnorthward by the Gulf Stream less able to sink. The new mass of relatively fresh water sits\non top of the ocean like a big thermal blanket, threatening the thermohaline circulation.\nThat in turn could make the Gulf Stream slow or veer southward. At some point, the whole\nsystem could simply shut down, and do so quickly. “There is increasing evidence that we\nare getting closer to a transition point, from which we can jump to a new state.”\n \n2",
