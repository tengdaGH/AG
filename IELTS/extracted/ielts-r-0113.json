  "passage_text": "Reading Practice\n \nCork\nCork - the thick bark of the cork oak tree (Quercus suber) - is a remarkable material. It is\ntough, elastic, buoyant, and fire-resistant, and suitable for a wide range of purposes. It has\nalso been used for millennia: the ancient Egyptians sealed then sarcophagi (stone coffins)\nwith cork, while the ancient Greeks and Romans used it for anything from beehives to\nsandals.\nAnd the cork oak itself is an extraordinary tree. Its bark grows up to 20 cm in thickness,\ninsulating the tree like a coat wrapped around the trunk and branches and keeping the\ninside at a constant 20°C all year round. Developed most probably as a defence against\nforest fires, the bark of the cork oak has a particular cellular structure - with about 40 million\ncells per cubic centimetre - that technology has never succeeded in replicating. The cells\nare filled with air, which is why cork is so buoyant. It also has an elasticity that means you\ncan squash it and watch it spring back to its original size and shape when you release the\npressure.\nCork oaks grow in a number of Mediterranean countries, including Portugal, Spain, Italy,\nGreece and Morocco. They flourish in warm, sunny climates where there is a minimum of\n400 millimetres of rain per year, and no more than 800 millimetres. Like grape vines, the\ntrees thrive in poor soil, putting down deep root in search of moisture and nutrients.\nSouthern Portugal’s Alentejo region meets all of these requirements, which explains why,\nby the early 20th century, this region had become the world’s largest producer of cork, and\nwhy today it accounts for roughly half of all cork production around the world.\nMost cork forests are family-owned. Many of these family businesses, and indeed many of\nthe trees themselves, are around 200 years old. Cork production is, above all, an exercise\nin patience. From the planting of a cork sapling to the first harvest takes 25 years, and a\ngap of approximately a decade must separate harvests from an individual tree. And for top-\nquality cork, it’s necessary to wait a further 15 or 20 years. You even have to wait for the\nright kind of summer’s day to harvest cork. If the bark is stripped on a day when it’s too cold\n- or when the air is damp - the tree will be damaged.\nCork harvesting is a very specialised profession. No mechanical means of stripping cork\nbark has been invented, so the job is done by teams of highly skilled workers. First, they\nmake vertical cuts down the bark using small sharp axes, then lever it away in pieces as\nlarge as they can manage. The most skilful cork- strippers prise away a semi-circular husk\nthat runs the length of the trunk from just above ground level to the first branches. It is then\ndried on the ground for about four months, before being taken to factories, where it is\nboiled to kill any insects that might remain in the cork. Over 60% of cork then goes on to be\nmade into traditional bottle stoppers, with most of the remainder being used in the\nconstruction trade, Corkboard and cork tiles are ideal for thermal and acoustic insulation,\nwhile granules of cork are used in the manufacture of concrete.\nRecent years have seen the end of the virtual monopoly of cork as the material for bottle\nstoppers, due to concerns about the effect it may have on the contents of the bottle. This is\ncaused by a chemical compound called 2,4,6-trichloroanisole (TCA), which forms through\nthe interaction of plant phenols, chlorine and mould. The tiniest concentrations - as little as\nthree or four parts to a trillion - can spoil the taste of the product contained in the bottle.\nThe result has been a gradual yet steady move first towards plastic stoppers and, more\n \n1\n\nrecently, to aluminium screw caps. These substitutes are cheaper to manufacture and, in\nthe case of screw caps, more convenient for the user.\n \nThe classic cork stopper does have several advantages, however. Firstly, its traditional\nimage is more in keeping with that of the type of high quality goods with which it has long\nbeen associated.
