  "passage_text": "Reading Practice\n \nThe Discovery of Uranus\nSomeone once put forward an attractive though unlikely theory. Throughout the Earth’s\nannual revolution around the sun, there is one point of space always hidden from our eyes.\nThis point is the opposite part of the Earth’s orbit, which is always hidden by the sun. Could\nthere be another planet there, essentially similar to our own, but always invisible?\nIf a space probe today sent back evidence that such a world existed it would cause not\nmuch more sensation than Sir William Herschel’s discovery of a new planet, Uranus, in\n1781. Herschel was an extraordinary man — no other astronomer has ever covered so\nvast a field of work — and his career deserves study. He was born in Hanover in Germany\nin 1738, left the German army in 1757, and arrived in England the same year with no\nmoney but quite exceptional music ability. He played the violin and oboe and at one time\nwas organist in the Octagon Chapel in the city of Bath. Herschel’s was an active mind, and\ndeep inside he was conscious that music was not his destiny; he therefore, read widely in\nscience and the arts, but not until 1772 did he come across a book on astronomy. He was\nthen 34, middle-aged by the standards of the time, but without hesitation he embarked on\nhis new career, financing it by his professional work as a musician. He spent years\nmastering the art of telescope construction, and even by present-day standards his\ninstruments are comparable with the best.\nSerious observation began 1774. He set himself the astonishing task of ‘reviewing the\nheavens’, in other words, pointing his telescope to every accessible part of the sky and\nrecording what he saw. The first review was made in 1775; the second, and most\nmomentous, in 1780-81. It was during the latter part of this that he discovered Uranus.\nAfterwards, supported by the royal grant in recognition of his work, he was able to devote\nhimself entirely to astronomy. His final achievements spread from the sun and moon to\nremote galaxies (of which he discovered hundreds), and papers flooded from his pen until\nhis death in 1822. Among these, there was one sent to the Royal Society in 1781, entitled\nAn Account of a Comet. In his own words:\nOn Tuesday the 13th of March, between ten and eleven in the evening, while I was\nexamining the small stars in the neighbourhood of H Geminorum, I perceived one that\nappeared visibly larger than the rest; being struck with its uncommon magnitude, I\ncompared it to H Geminorum and the small star in the quartile between Auriga and Gemini,\nand finding it to be much larger than either of them, suspected it to be a comet.\nHerschel’s care was the hallmark of a great observer; he was not prepared to jump any\nconclusions. Also, to be fair, the discovery of a new planet was the last thought in\nanybody’s mind. But further observation by other astronomers besides Herschel revealed\ntwo curious facts. For the comet, it showed a remarkably sharp disc; furthermore, it was\nmoving so slowly that it was thought to be a great distance from the sun, and comets are\nonly normally visible in the immediate vicinity of the sun. As its orbit came to be worked out\nthe truth dawned that it was a new planet far beyond Saturn’s realm, and that the ‘reviewer\nof the heavens’ had stumbled across an unprecedented prize. Herschel wanted to call it\ngeorgium sidus (Star of George) in honour of his royal patron King George III of Great\nBritain. The planet was later for a time called Herschel in honour of its discoverer. The\nname Uranus, which was first proposed by the German astronomer Johann Elert Bode,\nwas in use by the late 19th century.\n \n1\n\nUranus is a giant in construction, but not so much in size; its diameter compares\nunfavourably with that of Jupiter and Saturn, though on the terrestrial scale it is still\ncolossal. Uranus’ atmosphere consists largely of hydrogen and helium, with a trace of\nmethane. Through a telescope the planet appears as a small bluish-green disc with a faint\ngreen periphery. In 1977, while recording the occultation 1 of a star behind the planet, the\nAmerican astronomer James L. Elliot discovered the presence of five rings encircling the\nequator of Uranus. Four more rings were discovered in January 1986 during the\nexploratory flight of Voyager 2 2 , In addition to its rings, Uranus has 15 satellites (‘moons’),\nthe last 10 discovered by Voyager 2 on the same flight; all revolve about its equator and\nmove with the planet in an east—west direction. The two largest moons, Titania and\nOberon, were discovered by Herschel in 1787. The next two, Umbriel and Ariel, were found\nin 1851 by the British astronomer William Lassell.
