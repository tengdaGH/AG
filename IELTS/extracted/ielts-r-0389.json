  "passage_text": "Reading Practice\n \nSeed Hunting\nA\nWith a quarter of the world’s plants set to vanish within the next 50 years, Dough Alexander\nreports on the scientists working against the clock the preserve the Earth’s botanical\nheritage. They travel the four corners of the globe, scouring jungles, forests and savannas.\nBut they’re not looking for ancient artefacts, lost treasure or undiscovered tombs. Just\npods. It may lack the romantic allure of archaeology or the whiff of danger that\naccompanies going after a big game, but seed hunting is an increasingly serious business.\nSome seek seeds for profit-hunters in the employ of biotechnology firms, pharmaceutical\ncompanies and private corporations on the lookout for species that will yield the drugs or\ncrops of the future. Others collect to conserve, working to halt the sad slide into extinction\nfacing so many plant species.\nB\nAmong the pioneers of this botanical treasure hunt was John Tradescant, an English royal\ngardener who brought back plants and seeds from his journeys abroad in the early 1600s.\nLater, the English botanist Sir Joseph Banks – who was the first director of the Royal\nBotanic Gardens at Kew and travelled with Captain James Cook on his voyages near the\nend of the 18th century – was so driven to expand his collections that he sent botanists\naround the world at his own expense.\nC\nThose heady days of exploration and discovery may be over, but they have been replaced\nby a pressing need to preserve our natural history for the future. This modern mission\ndrives hunters such as Dr Michiel van Slageren, a good-natured Dutchman who often\nsports a wide-brimmed hat in the field – he could easily be mistaken for the cinematic hero\nIndiana Jones. He and three other seed hunters work at the Millennium Seed Bank, an 80\nmillion [pounds sterling] international conservation project that aims to protect the world’s\nmost endangered wild plant species.\nD\nThe group’s headquarters are in a modern glass-and-concrete structure on a 200-hectare\nEstate at Wakehurst Place in the West Sussex countryside. Within its underground vaults\nare 260 million dried seeds from 122 countries, all stored at -20 Celsius to survive for\ncenturies. Among the 5,100 species represented are virtually all of Britain’s 1,400 native\nseed-bearing plants, the most complete such collection of any country’s flora.\nE\nOverseen by the Royal botanic gardens, the Millennium Seed Bank is the world’s largest\nwild-plant depository. It aims to collect 24,000 species by 2010. The reason is simple:\nthanks to humanity’s effort, an estimated 25 per cent of the world’s plants are on the verge\nof extinction and may vanish within 50 years. We’re currently responsible for habitat\ndestruction on an unprecedented scale, and during the past 400 years, plant species\nextinction rates have been about 70 times greater than those indicated by the geological\nrecord as being ‘normal’. Experts predict that during the next 50 years further one billion\n \n1\n\nhectares of wilderness will be converted to farmland in developing countries alone.\nF\nThe implications of this loss are enormous. Besides providing staple food crops, plants are\na source of many machines and the principal supply of fuel and building materials in many\nparts of the world. They also protect soil and help regulate the climate. Yet, across the\nglobe, plant species are being driven to extinction before their potential benefits are\ndiscovered.\nG\nThe world Conservation Union has listed 5,714 threatened species is sure to be much\nhigher. In the UK alone, 300 wild plant species are classified as endangered. The\nMillennium Seed Bank aims to ensure that even if a plant becomes extinct in the wild, it\nwon’t be lost forever. Stored seeds can be used the help restore damaged or destroyed the\nenvironment or in scientific research to find new benefits for society- in medicine,\nagriculture or local industry- that would otherwise be lost.\nH\nSeed banks are an insurance policy to protect the world’s plant heritage for the future,\nexplains Dr Paul Smith, another Kew seed hunter. “Seed conservation techniques were\noriginally developed by farmers,” he says. “Storage is the basis what we do, conserving\nseeds until you can use them just as in farming,” Smith says there’s no reason why any\nplant species should become extinct, given today’s technology. But he admits that the\nbiggest challenge is finding, naming and categorizing all the world’s plants. And someone\nhas to gather these seeds before it’s too late. “There aren’t a lot of people out there doing\nthis,” he says. “The key is to know the flora from a particular area, and that knowledge\ntakes years to acquire.”\nI\nThere are about 1,470 seedbanks scattered around the globe, with a combined total of 5.4\nmillion samples, of which perhaps two million are distinct non-duplicates. Most preserve\ngenetic material for agriculture use in order to ensure crop diversity; others aim to conserve\nwild species, although only 15 per cent of all banked plants is wild.\nJ\nMany seed banks are themselves under threat due to a lack of funds. Last year, Imperial\nCollege, London, examined crop collections from 151 countries and found that while the\nnumber of plant samples had increased in two-thirds of the countries, the budget had been\ncut in a quarter and remained static in another 35 per cent. The UN’s Food and Agriculture\nOrganization and the Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research has since\nset up the Global Conservation Trust, which aims to raise the US $260 million to protect\nseed banks in perpetuity.\n \n2",
