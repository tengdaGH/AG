Which side of a dog has the most hair? The outside.' Hah! The\npunchline is silly yet fitting, tempting a smile, even a laugh. Laughter has always struck\npeople as deeply mysterious, perhaps pointless. The writer Arthur Koestler dubbed it the\nluxury reflex: ‘unique in that it serves no apparent biological purpose'.\nTheories about humour have an ancient pedigree. Plato expressed the idea that humour is\nsimply a delighted feeling of superiority over others. Kant and Freud felt that joke-telling\nrelies on building up a psychic tension which is safely punctured by the ludicrousness of\nthe punchline. But most modern humour theorists have settled on some version of\nAristotle's belief that jokes are based on a reaction to or resolution of incongruity, when the\npunchline is either a nonsense or, though appearing silly, has a clever second meaning.\nGraeme Ritchie, a computational linguist in Edinburgh, studies the linguistic structure of\njokes in order to understand not only humour but language understanding and reasoning in\nmachines. He says that while there is no single format for jokes, many revolve around a\nsudden and surprising conceptual shift. A comedian will present a situation followed by an\nunexpected interpretation that is also apt\nSo even if a punchline sounds silly, the listener can see there is a clever semantic fit and\nthat sudden mental 'Aha!' is the buzz that makes us laugh. Viewed from this angle, humour\nis just a form of creative insight, a sudden leap to a new perspective.\nHowever, there is another type of laughter, the laughter of social appeasement and it is\nimportant to understand this too. Play is a crucial part of development in most young\nmammals. Rats produce ultrasonic squeaks to prevent their scuffles turning nasty.\nChimpanzees have a 'play-face' - a gaping expression accompanied by a panting 'ah, ah'\nnoise. In humans, these signals have mutated into smiles and laughs. Researchers believe\nsocial situations, rather than cognitive events such as jokes, trigger these instinctual\nmarkers of play or appeasement. People laugh on fairground rides or when tickled to flag a\nplay situation, whether they feel amused or not.\nBoth social and cognitive types of laughter tap into the same expressive machinery in our\nbrains, the emotion and motor circuits that produce smiles and excited vocalisations.\nHowever, if cognitive laughter is the product of more general thought processes, it should\nresult from more expansive brain activity.  \nPsychologist Vinod Goel investigated humour using the new technique of 'single event'\nfunctional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). An MRI scanner uses magnetic fields and\nradio waves to track the changes in oxygenated blood that accompany mental activity.\nUntil recently, MRI scanners needed several minutes of activity and so could not be used to\ntrack rapid thought processes such as comprehending a joke. New developments now\nallow half-second 'snapshots' of all sorts of reasoning and problem-solving activities.\nAlthough Goel felt being inside a brain scanner was hardly the ideal place for appreciating\na joke, he found evidence that understanding a joke involves a widespread mental shift. His\nscans showed that at the beginning of a joke the listener's prefrontal cortex lit up,\n \n1\n\nparticularly the right prefrontal believed to be critical for problem solving. But there was also\nactivity in the temporal lobes at the side of the head (consistent with attempts to rouse\nstored knowledge) and in many other brain areas. Then when the punchline arrived, a new\narea sprang to life - the orbital prefrontal cortex. This patch of brain tucked behind the\norbits of the eyes is associated with evaluating information.\nMaking a rapid emotional assessment of the events of the moment is an extremely\ndemanding job for the brain, animal or human. Energy and arousal levels may need to be\nretuned in the blink of an eye. These abrupt changes will produce either positive or\nnegative feelings. The orbital cortex, the region that becomes active in Goel's experiment,\nseems the best candidate for the site that feeds such feelings into higher-level thought\nprocesses, with its close connections to the brain's sub-cortical arousal apparatus and\ncentres of metabolic control.\nAll warm-blooded animals make constant tiny adjustments in arousal in response to\nexternal events, but humans, who have developed a much more complicated internal life\nas a result of language, respond emotionally not only to their surroundings, but to their own\nthoughts. Whenever a sought-for answer snaps into place, there is a shudder of pleased\nrecognition. Creative discovery being pleasurable, humans have learned to find ways of\nmilking this natural response. The fact that jokes tap into our general evaluative machinery\nexplains why the line between funny and disgusting, or funny and frightening, can be so\nfine. Whether a joke gives pleasure or pain depends on a person's outlook.\nHumour may be a luxury, but the mechanism behind it is no evolutionary accident. As Peter\nDerks, a psychologist at William and Mary College in Virginia, says: 'I like to think of\nhumour as the distorted mirror of the mind.
