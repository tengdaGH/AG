Preserving tropical rainforests isn’t Costa Rica’s only\nsuccess, because the government also makes sure everyone has access to health-care\nand education. So when the New Economics Foundation released its second Happy Planet\nIndex, Costa Rica came out number one. The index is a ranking of countries based on their\nimpact on the environment and the health and happiness of their citizens.\nAccording to Mariano Rojas, a Costa Rican economics professor, Costa Rica is a mid-\nincome country where citizens have plenty of time for themselves and for their relationships\nwith others. ‘A mid-income level allows most citizens to satisfy their basic needs. The\ngovernment makes sure that all Costa Ricans have access to education, health and\nnutrition services.’ Costa Ricans, he believes, are not interested in status or spending\nmoney to show how successful they are. \nCreated in 2008, the Happy Planet Index examines happiness on a national level and\nranks 143 countries according to three measurements: their citizens’ happiness, how long\nthey live (which reflects their health), and how much of the planet’s resources each country\nconsumes. According to researcher Saamah Abdallah, the Index also measures the\noutcomes that are most important, and those are happy, healthy lives for everyone.\n \n1",
