  "passage_text": "Reading Practice\n \nWilliam Henry Perkin\nThe man who invented synthetic dyes\nWilliam Henry Perkin was born on March 12,1838, in London, England. \nAs a boy, Perkin’s curiosity prompted early interests in the arts, sciences, photography, and\nengineering. But it was a chance stumbling upon a run-down, yet functional, laboratory in\nhis late grandfather’s home that solidified the young man’s enthusiasm for chemistry.\nAs a student at the City of London School, Perkin became immersed in the study\nof chemistry. His talent and devotion to the subject were perceived by his teacher, Thomas\nHall, who encouraged him to attend a series of lectures given by the eminent scientist\nMichael Faraday at the Royal Institution. Those speeches fired the young chemist’s\nenthusiasm further, and he later went on to attend the Royal College of Chemistry, which\nhe succeeded in entering in 1853, at the age of 15.\nAt the time of Perkin’s enrolment, the Royal College of Chemistry was headed by the noted\nGerman chemist August Wilhelm Hofmann. Perkin’s scientific gifts soon caught Hofmann’s\nattention and, within two years, he became Hofmann’s youngest assistant. Not long after\nthat, Perkin made the scientific breakthrough that would bring him both fame and fortune.\nAt the time, quinine was the only viable medical treatment for malaria. The drug is derived\nfrom the bark of the cinchona tree, native to South America, and by 1856 demand for the\ndrug was surpassing the available supply. Thus, when Hofmann made some\npassing comments about the desirability of a synthetic substitute for quinine, it\nwas unsurprising that his star pupil was moved to take up the challenge.\nDuring his vacation in 1856, Perkin spent his time in the laboratory on the top floor of his\nfamily’s house. He was attempting to manufacture quinine from aniline, an inexpensive and\nreadily available coal tar waste product. Despite his best efforts, however, he did not\nend up with quinine. Instead, he produced a mysterious dark sludge. Luckily,\nPerkin’s scientific training and nature prompted him to investigate the substance\nfurther. Incorporating potassium dichromate and alcohol into the aniline at various stages of\nthe experimental process, he finally produced a deep purple solution. And, proving the truth\nof the famous scientist Louis Pasteur’s words ‘chance favours only the prepared mind’,\nPerkin saw the potential of his unexpected find.\nHistorically, textile dyes were made from such natural sources as plants and animal\nexcretions. Some of these, such as the glandular mucus of snails, were difficult to obtain\nand outrageously expensive. Indeed, the purple colour extracted from a snail was once so\ncostly that in society at the time only the rich could afford it. Further, natural dyes tended to\nbe muddy in hue and fade quickly. It was against this backdrop that Perkin’s discovery was\nmade.\nPerkin quickly grasped that his purple solution could be used to colour fabric, thus making it\nthe world’s first synthetic dye. Realising the importance of this breakthrough, he lost no\ntime in patenting it. But perhaps the most fascinating of all Perkin’s reactions to his find was\nhis nearly instant recognition that the new dye had commercial possibilities.\nPerkin originally named his dye Tyrian Purple, but it later became commonly known as\n \n1\n\nmauve (from the French for the plant used to make the colour violet). He asked advice of\nScottish dye works owner Robert Pullar, who assured him that manufacturing the dye\nwould be well worth it if the colour remained fast (i.e. would not fade) and the cost was\nrelatively low. So, over the fierce objections of his mentor Hofmann, he left college to give\nbirth to the modern chemical industry.\nWith the help of his father and brother, Perkin set up a factory not far from London. Utilising\nthe cheap and plentiful coal tar that was an almost unlimited by product of London’s gas\nstreet lighting, the dye works began producing the world’s first synthetically dyed material in\n1857. The company received a commercial boost from the Empress Eugenie of France,\nwhen she decided the new colour flattered her. Very soon, mauve was the necessary\nshade for all the fashionable ladies in that country.\nNot to be outdone, England’s Queen Victoria also appeared in public wearing a mauve\ngown, thus making it all the rage in England as well. The dye was bold and fast, and the\npublic clamoured for more. Perkin went back to the drawing board.\nAlthough Perkin’s fame was achieved and fortune assured by his first discovery, the\nchemist continued his research. Among other dyes he developed and introduced were\naniline red (1859) and aniline black (1863) and, in the late 1860s, Perkin’s green. It\nis important to note that Perkin’s synthetic dye discoveries had outcomes far beyond the\nmerely decorative. The dyes also became vital to medical research in many ways. For\ninstance, they were used to stain previously invisible microbes and bacteria, allowing\nresearchers to identify such bacilli as tuberculosis, cholera, and anthrax. Artificial dyes\ncontinue to play a crucial role today. And, in what would have been particularly pleasing\nto Perkin, their current use is in the search for a vaccine against malaria.\n \n2",
