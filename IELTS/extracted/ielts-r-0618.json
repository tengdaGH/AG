  "passage_text": "Reading Practice\n \nWhat destroyed the civilisation of Easter Island?\nA\nEaster Island, or Rapu Nui as it is known locally, is home to several hundred ancient\nhuman statues - the moai. After this remote Pacific island was settled by the Polynesians, it\nremained isolated for centuries. All the energy and resources that went into the moai -\nsome of which are ten metres tall and weigh over 7,000 kilos - came from the island itself.\nYet when Dutch explorers landed in 1722, they met a Stone Age culture. The moai were\ncarved with stone tools, then transported for many kilometres, without the use of animals or\nwheels, to massive stone platforms. The identity of the moai builders was in doubt until well\ninto the twentieth century. Thor Heyerdahl, the Norwegian ethnographer and adventurer,\nthought the statues had been created by pre-Inca peoples from Peru. Bestselling Swiss\nauthor Erich von Daniken believed they were built by stranded extraterrestrials.\nModern science - linguistic, archaeological and genetic evidence - has definitively\nproved the moai builders were Polynesians, but not how they moved their creations. Local\nfolklore maintains that the statues walked, while researchers have tended to assume the\nancestors dragged the statues somehow, using ropes and logs.\nB\nWhen the Europeans arrived, Rapa Nui was grassland, with only a few scrawny trees. In\nthe 1970s and 1980s, though, researchers found pollen preserved in lake sediments, which\nproved the island had been covered in lush palm forests for thousands of years. Only after\nthe Polynesians arrived did those forests disappear. US scientist Jared Diamond believes\nthat the Rapanui people - descendants of Polynesian settlers - wrecked their own\nenvironment. They had unfortunately settled on an extremely fragile island - dry, cool, and\ntoo remote to be properly fertilised by windblown volcanic ash. When the islanders cleared\nthe forests for firewood and farming, the forests didn’t grow back. As trees became scarce\nand they could no longer construct wooden canoes for fishing, they ate birds. Soil erosion\ndecreased their crop yields. Before Europeans arrived, the Rapanui had descended into\ncivil war and cannibalism, he maintains. The collapse of their isolated civilisation, Diamond\nwrites, is a ’worst-case scenario for what may lie ahead of us in our own future’.\nC\nThe moai, he thinks, accelerated the self-destruction. Diamond interprets them as power\ndisplays by rival chieftains who, trapped on a remote little island, lacked other ways of\nasserting their dominance. They competed by building ever bigger figures. Diamond thinks\nthey laid the moai on wooden sledges, hauled over log rails, but that required both a lot of\nwood and a lot of people. To feed the people, even more land had to be cleared. When the\nwood was gone and civil war began, the islanders began toppling the moai. By the\nnineteenth century none were standing.\nD\nArchaeologists Terry Hunt of the University of Hawaii and Carl Lipo of California State\nUniversity agree that Easter Island lost its lush forests and that it was an ‘ecological\ncatastrophe' - but they believe the islanders themselves weren’t to blame. And the moai\ncertainly weren’t. Archaeological excavations indicate that the Rapanui went to heroic\n \n1\n\nefforts to protect the resources of their wind-lashed, infertile fields. They built thousands of\ncircular stone windbreaks and gardened inside them, and used broken volcanic rocks to\nkeep the soil moist. In short, Hunt and Lipo argue, the prehistoric Rapanui were pioneers of\nsustainable farming.\nE\nHunt and Lipo contend that moai-building was an activity that helped keep the peace\nbetween islanders. They also believe that moving the moai required few people and no\nwood, because they were walked upright. On that issue, Hunt and Lipo say, archaeological\nevidence backs up Rapanui folklore. Recent experiments indicate that as few as 18 people\ncould, with three strong ropes and a bit of practice, easily manoeuvre a 1,000 kg moai\nreplica a few hundred metres. The figures’ fat bellies tilted them forward, and a D-shaped\nbase allowed handlers to roll and rock them side to side.\nF\nMoreover, Hunt and Lipo are convinced that the settlers were not wholly responsible for the\nloss of the island’s trees. Archaeological finds of nuts from the extinct Easter Island palm\nshow tiny grooves, made by the teeth of Polynesian rats. The rats arrived along with the\nsettlers, and in just a few years, Hunt and Lipo calculate, they would have overrun the\nisland. They would have prevented the reseeding of the slow-growing palm trees and\nthereby doomed Rapa Nui’s forest, even without the settlers’ campaign of deforestation. No\ndoubt the rats ate birds’ eggs too. Hunt and Lipo also see no evidence that Rapanui\ncivilisation collapsed when the palm forest did. They think its population grew rapidly and\nthen remained more or less stable until the arrival of the Europeans, who introduced\ndeadly diseases to which islanders had no immunity. Then in the nineteenth century\nslave traders decimated the population, which shrivelled to 111 people by 1877.\nG\nHunt and Lipo’s vision, therefore, is one of an island populated by peaceful and ingenious\nmoai builders and careful stewards of the land, rather than by reckless destroyers ruining\ntheir own environment and society. ‘Rather than a case of abject failure, Rapu Nui is an\nunlikely story of success’, they claim. Whichever is the case, there are surely some\nvaluable lessons which the world at large can learn from the story of Rapa Nui.\n \n2",
