  "passage_text": "Reading Practice\n \nIntelligence and Giftedness\nA\nIn 1904 the French minister of education, facing limited resources for schooling, sought a\nway to separate the unable from the merely lazy. Alfred Binet got the job of devising\nselection principles and his brilliant solution put a stamp on the study of intelligence and\nwas the forerunner of intelligence tests still used today, he developed a thirty-problem test\nin 1905, which tapped several abilities related to intellect, such as judgment and reasoning,\nthe test determined a given child’s mental age’. The test previously established a norm for\nchildren of a given physical age. (for example, five-year-old on average get ten items\ncorrect), therefore, a child with a mental age of five should score 10, which would mean\nthat he or she was functioning pretty much as others of that age. The child’s mental age\nwas then compared to his physical age.\nB\nA large disparity in the wrong direction (e.g., a child of nine with a mental age of four) might\nsuggest inability rather than laziness and mean he or she was earmarked for special\nschooling, Binet, however, denied that the test was measuring intelligence, its purpose was\nsimply diagnostic, for selection only. This message was however lost and caused many\nproblems and misunderstanding later.\nC\nAlthough Binet’s test was popular, it was a bit inconvenient to deal with a variety of physical\nand mental ages. So in 1912, Wilhelm Stern suggested simplifying this by reducing the two\nto a single number, he divided the mental age by the physical age and multiplied the result\nby 100. An average child, irrespective of age, would score 100. A number much lower than\n100 would suggest the need for help, and one much higher would suggest a child well\nahead of his peer.\nD\nThis measurement is what is now termed the IQ (for intelligence quotient) score and it has\nevolved to be used to show how a person, adult or child, performed in relation to others.\n(the term IQ was coined by Lewis M. Terman, professor of psychology and education of\nStanford University, in 1916. He had constructed an enormously influential revision of\nBinet’s test, called the Stanford-Binet test, versions of which are still given extensively.)\nE\nThe field studying intelligence and developing tests eventually coalesced into a sub-field of\npsychology called psychometrics (psycho for ‘mind’ and metrics for ‘measurements’). The\npractical side of psychometrics (the development and use of tests) became widespread\nquite early, by 1917, when Einstein published his grand theory of relativity, mass-scale\ntesting was already in use.
