  "passage_text": "Reading Practice\n \nThe water crisis\nGreater efficiency in water use is needed to meet the growing demands of a changing\nworld\nA\nPer capita water usage has been on an upward trend for many years. As countries\nindustrialise and their citizens become more prosperous, their individual water usage\nincreases rapidly. Annual per capita water withdrawals in the USA, for example, are about\n1,700 cubic metres, four times the level in China and fifty times the level in Ethiopia. In the\n21st century, the world's limited supply of renewable fresh water is having to meet\ndemands of both larger total population and increased per capita consumption. The only\npracticable ways to resolve this problem in the longer term are economic pricing in\nconjunction with conservation measures.\nB\nAgriculture consumes about 70% of the world's fresh water, so improvements in irrigation\ncan make the greatest impact. At present, average efficiency in the use of irrigated water in\nagriculture may be as low as 50%. Simple changes could improve the rate substantially,\nthough it is unrealistic to expect very high levels of water-use efficiency in many developing\ncountries, faced as they are with a chronic lack of capital and a largely untrained rural\nworkforce. After agriculture, industry is the second biggest user of water and, in terms of\nvalue added per litre used, is sixty times more productive than agriculture. However, some\nindustrial processes use vast amounts of water. For example, production of 1 kg of\naluminium might require 1,500 litres of water. Paper production too is often very water-\nintensive. Though new processes have greatly reduced consumption, there is still plenty of\nroom for big savings in industrial uses of water.\nC\nIn rich countries, water consumption has gradually been slowed down by price increases\nand the use of modern technology and recycling. In the USA, industrial production has\nrisen fourfold since 1950, while water consumption has fallen by more than a third. Japan\nand Germany have similarly improved their use of water in manufacturing processes.\nJapanese industry, for example, now recycles more than 75% of process water. However,\nindustrial water consumption is continuing to increase sharply in developing countries. With\ndomestic and agricultural demands also increasing, the capacity of water supply systems is\nunder growing strain.\nD\nMany experts believe that the best way to counter this trend is to impose water charges\nbased on the real cost of supplies. This would provide a powerful incentive for consumers\nto introduce water-saving processes and recycling. Few governments charge realistic\nprices for water, especially to farmers. Even in rich California, farmers get water for less\nthan a tenth of the cost of supply. In many developing countries there is virtually no charge\nfor irrigation water, while energy prices are heavily subsidised too (which means that\nfarmers can afford to run water pumps day and night). Water, which was once regarded as\na free gift from heaven, is becoming a commodity which must be bought and sold on the\nopen market just like oil. In the oil industry, the price increases which hit the market in the\n1970s, coupled with concerns that supplies were running low, led to new energy\n \n1\n\nconservation measures all over the world. It was realised that investing in new sources was\na far more costly option than improving efficiency of use. A similar emphasis on\nconservation will be the best and cheapest option for bridging the gap between water\nsupply and demand.\nE\nOne way to cut back on water consumption is simply to prevent leaks. It is estimated that in\nsome of the biggest cities of the Third World, more than half of the water entering the\nsystem is lost through leaks in pipes, dripping taps and broken installations. Even in the\nUK, losses were estimated at 25% in the early 1990s because of the failure to maintain the\nantiquated water supply infrastructure. In addition, huge quantities of water are consumed\nbecause used water from sewage pipes, storm drains and factories is merely flushed away\nand discharged into rivers or the sea. The modern approach, however, is to see used water\nas a resource which can be put to good use - either in irrigation or, after careful treatment,\nas recycled domestic water. Israel, for instance, has spent heavily on used water treatment.\nSoon, treated, recycled water will account for most farm irrigation there. There are other\nexamples in cities such as St Petersburg, Florida, where all municipal water is recycled\nback into domestic systems.\nF\nAnother way of conserving water resources involves better management of the\nenvironment generally. Interference with the ecosystem can have a severe effect on both\nlocal rainfall patterns and water run-off. Forest clearings associated with India's Kabini dam\nproject reduced local rainfall by 25%, a phenomenon observed in various other parts of the\nworld where large-scale deforestation has taken place. Grass and other vegetation acts as\na sponge which absorbs rainfall both in the plants and in the ground. Removal of the\nvegetation means that rainfall runs off the top of the land, accelerating erosion instead of\nbeing gradually fed into the soil to renew ground water.\nG\nGlobal warming is bound to affect rainfall patterns, though there is considerable\ndisagreement about its precise effects. But it is likely that, as sea levels rise, countries in\nlow-lying coastal areas will be hit by seawater penetration of ground water. Other countries\nwill experience changes in rainfall which could have a major impact on agricultural yield -\neither for better or for worse. In broad terms, it is thought that rainfall zones will shift\nnorthwards, adding to the water deficit in Africa, the Middle East and the Mediterranean - a\ngrim prospect indeed.\n \n2",
