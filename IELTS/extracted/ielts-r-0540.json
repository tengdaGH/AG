  "passage_text": "Reading Practice\n \nThe Return of Artificial Intelligence\nIt is becoming acceptable again to talk of computers performing human tasks such\nas problem-solving and pattern-recognition.\nA\nAfter years in the wilderness, the term ‘artificial intelligence' (Al) seems poised to make a\ncomeback. Al was big in the 1980s but vanished in the 1990s. It re-entered public\nconsciousness with the release of Al, a movie about a robot boy. This has ignited public\ndebate about Al, but the term is also being used once more within the computer industry.\nResearchers, executives and marketing people are now using the expression without irony\nor inverted commas. And it is not always hype. The term is being applied, with some\njustification, to products that depend on technology that was originally developed by Al\nresearchers. Admittedly, the rehabilitation of the term has a long way to go, and some firms\nstill prefer to avoid using it. But the fact that others are starting to use it again suggests that\nAl has moved on from being seen as an over- ambitious and under-achieving field of\nresearch.\nB\nThe field was launched, and the term ‘artificial intelligence’ coined, at a conference in\n1956,,by a group of researchers that included Marvin Minsky, John McCarthy, Herbert\nSimon and Alan Newell, all of whom went on to become leading figures in the field. The\nexpression provided an attractive but informative name for a research programme that\nencompassed such previously disparate fields as operations research, cybernetics, logic\nand computer science. The goal they shared was an attempt to capture or mimic human\nabilities using machines. That said, different groups of researchers attacked different\nproblems, from speech recognition to chess playing, in different ways; Al unified the field in\nname only. But it was a term that captured the public imagination.\nC\nMost researchers agree that Al peaked around 1985. A public reared on science-fiction\nmovies and excited by the growing power of computers had high expectations. For years,\nAl researchers had implied that a breakthrough was just around the corner. Marvin Minsky\nsaid in 1967 that within a generation the problem of creating ‘artificial intelligence' would be\nsubstantially solved. Prototypes of medical-diagnosis programs and speech recognition\nsoftware appeared to be making progress. It proved to be a false dawn. Thinking\ncomputers and household robots failed to materialise, and a backlash ensued. 'There was\nundue optimism in the early f 980s,’ says David Leake, a researcher at Indiana University.\n‘Then when people realised these were hard problems, there was retrenchment. By the late\n1980s, the term Al was being avoided by many researchers, who opted instead to align\nthemselves with specific sub-disciplines such as neural networks, agent technology, case-\nbased reasoning, and so on.’\nD\nIronically, in some ways Al was a victim of its own success. Whenever an apparently\nmundane problem was solved, such as building a system that could land an aircraft\n \n1\n\nunattended, the problem was deemed not to have been Al in the first place. ‘If it works, it\ncan’t be Al,' as Dr Leake characterises it. The effect of repeatedly moving the goal-posts in\nthis way was that Al came to refer to 'blue-sky' research that was still years away from\ncommercialisation, Researchers joked that Al stood for 'almost implemented’. Meanwhile,\nthe technologies that made it once the market, such as speech recognition, language\ntranslation and decision-support software, were no longer regarded as Al. Yet all three\nonce fell well within the umbrella of Al research.\nE\nBut the tide may now be turning, according to Dr Leake. HNC Software of San Diego,\nbacked by a government agency, reckon chat their new approach to artificial intelligence is\nthe most powerful and promising approach ever discovered. HNC claim that their system,\nbased on a duster of 30 processors, could be used to spot camouflaged vehicles on a\nbattlefield or extract a voice signal from a noisy background - tasks humans can do well,\nbut computers cannot. ‘Whether or not their technology lives up to the claims made for it,\nthe fact that HNC are emphasising the use of Al is itself an interesting development,' says\nDr Leake.\nF\nAnother factor that may boost the prospects for Al in the near future is that investors are\nnow looking for firms using clever technology, rather than just a clever business model, to\ndifferentiate themselves. In particular, the problem of information overload, exacerbated by\nthe growth of e-mail and the explosion in the number of web pages, means there are plenty\nof opportunities for new technologies to help filter and categorise information - classic Al\nproblems. That may mean that more artificial intelligence companies will start to emerge to\nmeet this challenge.\nG\nThe 1969 film, 2001:A Space Odyssey, featured an intelligent computer called HAL 9000.\nAs well as understanding and speaking English, HAL could play chess and even learned to\nlipread. HAL thus encapsulated the optimism of the 1960s that intelligent computers would\nbe widespread by 2001. But 2001 has been and gone, and there is still no sign of a HAL-\nlike computer. Individual systems can play chess or transcribe speech, but a general theory\nof machine intelligence still remains elusive. It may be. however, that the comparison with\nHAL no longer seems quite so Important, and Al can now be judged by what it can do,\nrather than by how well it matches up to a 30-year-old science-fiction film. ‘People are\nbeginning to realise that there are impressive things that these systems can do.’ says Dr\nLeake hopefully.\n \n2",
