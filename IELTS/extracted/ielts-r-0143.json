  "passage_text": "Reading Practice\n \n \nEco-Resort Management\n \nA    Ecotourism is often regarded as a form of nature-based tourism and has become an\nimportant alternative source of tourists. In addition to providing the traditional resort-leisure\nproduct, it has been argued that ecotourism resort management should have a particular\nfocus on best-practice environmental management, an educational and interpretive\ncomponent, and direct and indirect contributions to the conservation of the natural and\ncultural environment (Ayala, 1996).\nB    Couran Cove Island Resort is a large integrated ecotourism-based resort located south\nof Brisbane on the Gold Coast, Queensland, Australia. As the world’s population becomes\nincreasingly urbanised, the demand for tourist attractions which are environmentally\nfriendly, serene and offer amenities of a unique nature, has grown rapidly. Couran Cove\nResort, which is one such tourist attractions, is located on South Stradbroke Island,\noccupying approximately 150 hectares of the island. South Stradbroke Island is separated\nfrom the mainland by the Broadwater, a stretch of sea 3 kilometers wide. More than a\ncentury ago, there was only one Stradbroke Island, and there were at least four aboriginal\ntribes living and hunting on the island. Regrettably, most of the original island dwellers were\neventually killed by diseases such as tuberculosis, smallpox and influenza by the end of the\n19th The second ship wreak on the island in 1894, and the subsequent destruction of the\nship (the Cambus Wallace) because it contained dynamite, caused a large crater in the\nsandhills on Stradbroke Island. Eventually, the ocean broke through the weakened land\nform and Stradbroke became two islands. Couran Cove Island Resort is built on one of the\nworld’s few naturally-occurring sand lands, which is home to a wide range of plant\ncommunities and one of the largest remaining remnants of the rare livistona rainforest left\non the Gold Coast. Many mangrove and rainforest areas, and Malaleuca Wetlands on\nSouth Stradbroke Island (and in Queensland), have been cleared, drained or filled for\nresidential, industrial, agricultural or urban development in the first half of the 20th century.\nFarmer and graziers finally abandoned South Stradbroke Island in 1939 because the\nvegetation and the soil conditions there were not suitable for agricultural activities.\nSUSTAINABLE PRACTICES OF COURAN COVE RESORT\nBeing located on an offshore island, the resort is only accessible by means of water\ntransportation. The resort provides hourly ferry service from the marina on the mainland to\nand from the island. Within the resort, transport modes include walking trails, bicycle tracks\nand the beach train. The reception area is the counter of the shop which has not changed\nin 8 years at least. The accommodation is an octagonal “Bure”. These are large rooms that\nare clean but! The equipment is tired and in some cases just working. Our ceiling fan only\nworked on high speed for example. Beds are hard but clean, there is television, radio, an\nold air conditioner and a small fridge. These “Bures” are right on top of each other and\nnight noises do carry so be careful what you say and do. The only thing is the mosquitos\nbut if you forget to bring mosquito repellant they sell some on the island.\nAs an ecotourism-based resort, most of the planning and development of the attraction has\nbeen concentrated on the need to co-exist with the fragile natural environment of South\nStradbroke Island to achieve sustainable development.\nWATER AND ENERGY MANAGEMENT\n \n1\n\nC  South Stradbroke Island has groundwater at the centre of the island, which has a\nmaximum height of 3 metres above sea level. The water supply is recharged by rainfall and\nis commonly known as an unconfined freshwater aquifer. Couran Cove Island Resort\nobtains its water supply by tapping into this aquifer and extracting it via a bore system.\nSome of the problems which have threatened the island’s freshwater supply include\npollution, contamination and over-consumption. In order to minimise some of these\nproblems, all laundry activities are carried out on the mainland. The resort considers\nwashing machines as onerous to the island’s freshwater supply, and that the detergents\ncontain a high level of phosphates which are a major source of water pollution. The resort\nuses LPG-power generation rather than a diesel-powered plant for its energy supply,\nsupplemented by wind turbine, which has reduced greenhouse emissions by 70% of diesel-\nequivalent generation methods. Excess heat recovered from the generator is used to heat\nthe swimming pool. Hot water in the eco-cabins and for some of the resort’s vehicles are\nsolar-powered. Water efficient fittings are also installed in showers and toilets. However,\nnot all the appliances used by the resort are energy efficient, such as refrigerators. Visitors\nwho stay at the resort are encouraged to monitor their water and energy usage via the in-\nhouse television system, and are rewarded with prizes (such as a free return trip to the\nresort) accordingly if their usage level is low.\nCONCLUDING REMARKS\nD  We examined a case study of good management practice and a pro-active sustainable\ntourism stance of an eco-resort. In three years of operation, Couran Cove Island Resort\nhas won 23 international and national awards, including the 2001 Australian Tourism\nAward in the 4-Star Accommodation category. The resort has embraced and has effectively\nimplemented contemporary environmental management practices. It has been argued that\nthe successful implementation of the principles of sustainability should promote long-term\nsocial, economic and environmental benefits, while ensuring and enhancing the prospects\nof continued viability for the tourism enterprise. Couran Cove Island Resort does not\nconform to the characteristics of the ResortDevelopmentSpectrum, as proposed by\nPrideaux (2000). According to Prideaux, the resort should be at least at Phase 3 of the\nmodel (the National tourism phase), which describes an integrated resort providing 3-4 star\nhotel-type accommodation. The primary tourist market in Phase 3 of the model consists\nmainly of interstate visitors. However, the number of interstate and international tourists\nvisiting the resort is small, with the principal visitor markets comprising locals and residents\nfrom nearby towns and the Gold Coast region. The carrying capacity of Couran Cove does\nnot seem to be of any concern to the Resort management. Given that it is a private\ncommercial ecotourist enterprise, regulating the number of visitors to the resort to minimize\ndamage done to the natural environment on South Stradbroke Island is not a binding\nconstraint. However, the Resort’s growth will eventually be constrained by its carrying\ncapacity, and quantity control should be incorporated in the management strategy of the\nresort.\n \n2",
