But these fertile, dark soils are in fact very special, because despite the lushness\nof tropical rainforests, the soils beneath them are usually very poor and thin. Even more\nsurprising is where this dark soil comes from.\n‘You might expect this precious fertile resource to be found in the deep jungle, far from\nhuman settlements or farmers,’ says James Fraser, who has been hunting for it in Africa’s\nrainforests. 'But I go looking for dark earth round the edge of villages and ancient towns,\nand in traditionally farmed areas. It’s usually there. And the older and larger the settlement,\nthe more dark earth there is.’\nSuch findings are overturning some long-held ideas. Jungle farmers are usually blamed not\njust for cutting down trees but also for exhausting the soils. And yet the discovery of these\nrich soils - first in South America and now in Africa, too - suggest that, whether by chance\nor design, many people living in rainforests farmed in a way that enhanced rather than\ndestroyed soils. In fact, it is becoming clear that part of what we think of as lush pure\nrainforest is actually long-abandoned farmland, enriched by the waste created by ancient\nhumans.\n \n1",
