  "passage_text": "Reading Practice\n \nThe Concept of Role Theory\nAny individual in any situation occupies a role in relation to other people. The particular\nindividual with whom one is concerned in the analysis of any situation is usually given the\nname of focal person. He has the focal role and can be regarded as sitting in the middle of\na group of people, with whom he interacts in some way in that situation. This group of\npeople is called his role set. For instance, in the family situation, an individual’s role set\nmight be shown as in Figure 6.Role set\nFigure 6\nThe role set should include all those with whom the individual has more than trivial\ninteractions.\nRole definition\nThe definition of any individual’s role in any situation will be a combination of the role\nexpectations that the members of the role set have of the focal role. These expectations\nare often occupationally denned, sometimes even legally so. The role definitions of lawyers\nand doctors are fairly clearly defined both in legal and in cultural terms. The role definitions\nof, say, a film star or bank manager, are also fairly clearly defined in cultural terms, too\nclearly perhaps.\nIndividuals often find it hard to escape from the role that cultural traditions have defined for\nthem. Not only with doctors or lawyers is the required role behaviour so constrained that if\nyou are in that role for long it eventually becomes part of you, part of your personality.\nHence, there is some likelihood that all accountants will be alike or that all blondes are\nsimilar - they are forced that way by the expectations of their role. \nIt is often important that you make it clear what your particular role is at a given time. The\nmeans of doing this are called, rather obviously, role signs. The simplest of role signs is a\nuniform. The number of stripes on your arm or pips on your shoulder is a very precise role\ndefinition which allows you to do certain very prescribed things in certain situations.\nImagine yourself questioning a stranger on a dark street at midnight without wearing the\nrole signs of a policeman!\nIn social circumstances, dress has often been used as a role sign to indicate the nature\nand degree of formality of any gathering and occasionally the social status of people\npresent. The current trend towards blurring these role signs in dress is probably\ndemocratic, but it also makes some people very insecure. Without role signs, who is to\nknow who has what role?\nPlace is another role sign. Managers often behave very differently outside the office and in\nit, even to the same person. They use a change of location to indicate a change in role\nfrom, say, boss to friend. Indeed, if you wish to change your roles you must find some\noutward sign that you are doing so or you won’t be permitted to change - the subordinate\nwill continue to hear you as his boss no matter how hard you try to be his friend. In very\nsignificant cases of role change, e.g. from a soldier in the ranks to officer, from bachelor to\nmarried man, the change of role has to have a very obvious sign, hence rituals. It is\ninteresting to observe, for instance, some decline in the emphasis given to marriage rituals.\n \n1\n\nThis could be taken as an indication that there is no longer such a big change in role from\nsingle to married person, and therefore no need for a public change in sign.\nIn organisations, office signs and furniture are often used as role signs. These and other\nperquisites of status are often frowned upon, but they may serve a purpose as a kind of\nuniform in a democratic society; roles without signs often lead to confused or differing\nexpectations of the role of the focal person. \nRole ambiguity\nRole ambiguity results when there is some uncertainty in the minds, either of the focal\nperson or of the members of his role set, as to precisely what his role is at any given time.\nOne of the crucial expectations that shape the role definition is that of the individual, the\nfocal person himself. If his occupation of the role is unclear, or if it differs from that of the\nothers in the role set, there will be a degree of role ambiguity. Is this bad? Not necessarily,\nfor the ability to shape one’s own role is one of the freedoms that many people desire, but\nthe ambiguity may lead to role stress which will be discussed later on. The virtue of j ob\ndescriptions is that they lessen this role ambiguity. Unfortunately, job descriptions are\nseldom complete role definitions, except at the lower end of the scale. At middle and higher\nmanagement levels, they are often a list of formal jobs and duties that say little about the\nmore subtle and informal expectations of the role. The result is therefore to give the\nindividual an uncomfortable feeling that there are things left unsaid, i. e. to heighten the\nsense of role ambiguity.\nLooking at role ambiguity from the other side, from the point of view of the members of the\nrole set, lack of clarity in the role of the focal person can cause insecurity, lack of\nconfidence, irritation and even anger among members of his role set. One list of the roles\nof a manager identified the following: executive, planner, policy maker, expert, controller of\nrewards and punishments, counsellor, friend, teacher. If it is not clear, through role signs of\none sort or another, which role is currently the operational one, the other party may not\nreact in the appropriate way — we may, in fact, hear quite another message if the focal\nperson speaks to us, for example, as a teacher and we hear her as an executive. \n \n2",
