  "passage_text": "Reading Practice\nSynaesthesia\nA \nImagine a page with a square box in the middle. The box is lined with rows of the number\n5, repeated over and over. All of the 5s are identical in size, font and colour, and equally\ndistributed across the box. There is, however, a trick: among those 5s, hiding in plain sight\nis a single, capital letter S. Almost the same in shape, it is impossible to spot without\nstraining your eyes for a good few minutes. Unless that is, you are a grapheme – colour\nsynaesthete – a person who sees each letter and number in dierent colours. With all the 5s\npainted in one colour and the rogue S painted in another, a grapheme – colour synaesthete\nwill usually only need a split second to identify the latter.\nB\nSynaesthesia, loosely translated as “senses coming together” from the Greek words syn\n(“with”) and aesthesis (“sensation”), is an interesting neurological phenomenon that causes\ndierent senses to be combined. This might mean that words have a particular taste (for\nexample, the word “door” might taste like bacon), or that certain smells produce a particular\ncolour. It might also mean that each letter and number has its own personality-the letter A\nmight be perky, the letter B might be shy and self-conscious, etc. Some synaesthetes might\neven experience other people’s sensations, for example feeling pain in their chest when\nthey witness a film character gets shot. The possibilities are endless: even though\nsynaesthesia is believed to aect less than 5% of the general population, at least 60 dierent\ncombinations of senses have been reported so far. What all these sensory associations\nhave in common is that they are all involuntary and impossible to repress and that they\nusually remain quite stable over time.\nC\nSynaesthesia was first documented in the early 19th century by German physician Georg\nSachs, who dedicated two pages of his dissertation on his own experience with the\ncondition. It wasn’t, however, until the mid-1990s that empirical research proved its\nexistence when Professor Simon Baron-Cohen and his colleagues used fMRls on six\nsynaesthetes and discovered that the parts of the brain associated with vision were active\nduring auditory stimulation, even though the subjects were blindfolded.\nD\nWhat makes synaesthesia a particularly interesting condition is that it isn’t an illness at all.\nIf anything, synaesthetes often report feeling sorry for the rest of the population, as they\ndon’t have the opportunity to experience the world in a multisensory fashion like they do.\nVery few drawbacks have been described, usually minimal: for instance, some words might\nhave an unpleasant taste (imagine the word “hello” tasting like spoilt milk), while some\nsynaesthetes find it distressing when they encounter people with names which don’t reflect\ntheir personality (imagine meeting a very interesting person named “Lee”, when the letter E\nhas a dull or hideous colour for you-or vice versa). Overall, however, synaesthesia is widely\nconsidered more of a blessing than a curse and it is often linked to intelligence and\ncreativity, with celebrities such as Lady Gaga and Pharrell Williams claiming to have it.\nE\n \n1\n\nAnother fascinating side of synaesthesia is the way it could potentially benefit future\ngenerations. In a 2013 study, Dr Witthof and Dr Winawer discovered that grapheme-colour\nsynaesthetes who had never met each other before experienced strikingly similar pairings\nbetween graphemes and colours-pairings which were later traced back to a popular set of\nFischer-Price magnets that ten out of eleven participants distinctly remembered possessing\nas children. This was particularly peculiar as synaesthesia is predominantly considered to\nbe a hereditary condition, and the findings suggested that a synaesthete’s environment\nmight play a determining role in establishing synaesthetic associations. If that was true,\nresearchers asked, then might it not be possible that synaesthesia can actually be taught?\nF\nAs it turns out, the benefits of teaching synaesthesia would be tremendous. According to\nresearch conducted by Dr Clare Jonas at the University of East London, teaching people to\ncreate grapheme-colour associations the same way as a synaesthete may have the\npossibility to improve cognitive function and memory. As she put it, ‘one possibility is\nguarding against cognitive decline in older people-using synaesthesia in the creation of\nmnemonics to remember things such as shopping lists.’ To that end, researchers in the\nNetherlands have already begun developing a web browser plug-in that will change the\ncolours of certain letters. Rothen and his colleagues corroborate the theory: in a paper\npublished in 2011, they suggest that synaesthesia might be more than a hereditary\ncondition, as the non-synaesthetic subjects of their study were able to mimic synaesthetic\nassociations long after leaving the lab.\nG\nThere is obviously still a long way to go before we can fully understand synaesthesia and\nwhat causes it. Once we do, however, it might not be too long before we find out how to\nteach non-synaesthetes how to imitate its symptoms in a way that induces the same\nbenefits 4.4% of the world’s population currently enjoy.\n \n2",
