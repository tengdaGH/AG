  "passage_text": "Reading Practice\n \nWhy good ideas fail\nAs part of a marketing course, two marketing experts comment on a hypothetical case\nstudy involving TF, a fiction retail giant specializing in home furnishing. The experts give\nconcrete solutions and advice to assist students.\n \n \n \n \n \n \nHypothetical case study:\nTF became a retail success in the 1970s when it succeeded in spotting homeware trends\nand meeting the needs of its then trendy young customers. However; by 2004, the IF\nstores were failing and a rethink was clearly necessary. Tibal Fisher, TF's founder and\nCEO, decided to change its focus under the new brand name of TVs Nextstage. His aim\nwas to recapture the now ageing customers that had given him his early success and\ntarget consumers aged 60+ with devices and gadgets specifically designed to assist them\nwith the problems associated with ageing: mobile phones with screens that were easy to\nread; kitchen gadgets with comfortable grips; electronic devices that were easy to set and\nadjust. TF’s market research proved to be very positive, showing strong consumer support\nfor the products\nIn 2007, the stores were remodelled at a cost of US $40 million and the new brand was\nlaunched. Each store was made more comfortable and featured a coffee shop to help\nincrease traffic - Tibal had predicted that if they could get customers into the stores then\nthe products would sell themselves. However, by 2009 it was clear that the idea was a\nfailure and the stores consistently remained empty. Customers complained that the new\nstores felt like a senior center and reminded them that they were growing old.\nFeedback from expert\nExpert 1: Donna Sturgess, global head of innovation, GlaxoSmithKline\n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe TReam's customer research efforts are a classic case of missing the subconscious\nassociations at work in consumers' minds. Tlbal and his executives looked only at surface\nattitudes. Since those attitudes make up a relatively small part of the total consumer\nresponse, the executives are clueless about the reason for the poor sales. It's critical for\ncompanies to understand that every customer relates to a brand emotionally, and it’s those\nemotions that trigger - or block - purchases\nThat's why we’ve focused on using emotional strategies behind branding for a number of\nyears now. A great example Is Alli (pronounced 'ally'), a drug to aid weight loss. The\nproduct deals with a highly emotional issue, so in marketing it, we faced the same\nchallenge that the new TFstores are facing: the very thought of buying the product reminds\ncustomers that they have problems they feel negatively In the case of TF’s Nextstage, the\nproblems are age and infirmity. In the case of Alli, the problems are excessive weight and\nall consequences. There's always a risk that consumers' negative feelings will discourage\nthem from starting or staying on a diet. So, after extensive market research, we took a\nnumber of steps to inject emotions into the whole process of using the product.\nFirst we came up with a name that sounds like a helpful partner. We also aimed to make\nthe container both beautiful and functional — something that didn’t just hold pills but could\nlater be used to store diet guides and recipes. Traditional market research is unlikely to\nuncover Ideas like this, so we use a wide variety of techniques. Even simple techniques\n \n1\n\nsuch as one-on-one interviews, or ethnographical observation that involves going into\npeople's houses to examine their behaviour, can provide valuable data.\n \n \nExpert 2: Alex Lee, president of 0X0 International, maker of 0X0 Good Grips household\nproducts\nThis retailer can get back on track by remembering a principle that applies to consumers In\ngeneral and those aged 60+ in particular: they’re attracted by brands they associate with\nthe type of people they’d like to be - not the type they really are. That's why marketing\ncampaigns for surf gear feature surfers, not the city dwellers who will wear the products\nwhile doing their shopping\n-was reminded of this principle few years ago when we wanted to find out how far we\ncould apply our design philosophy of makings things easier to use in order to move\nfrom our core business, kitchen tools, into other products. We conducted what are\nknown as focus groups, where participants were asked to look at photos of people and\npick those they are perceived to be users and nonusers of our products. Consistently\nthey picked people who looked fit as the sort who would use our products, and people\nwho look old and boring as the sort who wouldn't. Yet the participants, all owners of our\nproducts, looked a lot more like the later than the former\nAlthough the needs of elderly users and those with deteriorating vision or dexterity are very\nmuch taken into consideration when we develop new designs, we try to offer that appeal to\n20- and 30-year-olds. We believe that referring to these products as helping tools would\nserve only to harm the brand in our customers' eyes. That's why our philosophy of\nuniversal design, which involves creating products that are comfortably useable by the\nlargest possible range of people, is never explicitly stated as part of our marketing position.\nWe’ve found that market research does not need to be very sophisticated. For instance, we\nhave conducted simple surveys in the lobby of our building offering free products in\nexchange for people's opinions. Some may call this unscientific but we have uncovered\ngreat insights this way. Sometimes the most important signals come from an executive's\nown instincts. In Tibal fisher's case, this could have told him what his surveys and focus\ngroups didn't: 60-plus-year-olds won't support a business that expects them to act their\nage.\n \n2",
