  "passage_text": "Reading Practice\n \nSoviet’s New Working Week\nHistorian investigates how Stalin changed the calendar to keep the Soviet people\ncontinually at work\nA\n“There are no fortresses that Bolsheviks cannot storm”. With these words, Stalin expressed\nthe dynamic self-confidence of the Soviet Union’s Five Year Plan: weak and backward\nRussia was to turn overnight into a powerful modern industrial country. Between 1928 and\n1932, production of coal, iron and steel increased at a fantastic rate, and new industrial\ncities sprang up, along with the world’s biggest dam. Everyone’s life was affected, as\ncollectivised farming drove millions from the land to swell the industrial proletariat. Private\nenterprise disappeared in city and country, leaving the State supreme under the\ndictatorship of Stalin. Unlimited enthusiasm was the mood of the day, with the Communists\nbelieving that iron will and hard-working manpower alone would bring about a new world.\nB\nEnthusiasm spread to time itself, in the desire to make the state a huge efficient machine,\nwhere not a moment would be wasted, especially in the workplace. Lenin had already been\nintrigued by the ideas of the American Frederick Winslow Taylor (1856-1915), whose time-\nmotion studies had discovered ways of stream-lining effort so that every worker could\nproduce the maximum. The Bolsheviks were also great admirers of Henry Ford’s assembly\nline mass production and of his Fordson tractors that were imported by the thousands. The\nengineers who came with them to train their users helped spread what became a real cult\nof Ford. Emulating and surpassing such capitalist models formed part of the training of the\nnew Soviet Man, a heroic figure whose unlimited capacity for work would benefit everyone\nin the dynamic new society. All this culminated in the Plan, which has been characterized\nas the triumph of the machine, where workers would become supremely efficient robot-like\ncreatures.\nC\nYet this was Communism whose goals had always included improving the lives of the\nproletariat. One major step in that direction was the sudden announcement in 1927 that\nreduced the working day from eight to seven hours. In January 1929, all Indus-tries were\nordered to adopt the shorter day by the end of the Plan. Workers were also to have an\nextra hour off on the eve of Sundays and holidays. Typically though, the state took away\nmore than it gave, for this was part of a scheme to increase production by establishing a\nthree-shift system. This meant that the factories were open day and night and that many\nhad to work at highly undesirable hours.\nD\nHardly had that policy been announced, though, then Yuri Larin, who had been a close\nassociate of Lenin and architect of his radical economic policy, came up with an idea for\neven greater efficiency. Workers were free and plants were closed on Sundays. Why not\nabolish that wasted day by instituting a continuous workweek so that the machines could\noperate to their full capacity every day of the week? When Larin presented his ides to the\nCongress of Soviets in May 1929, no one paid much attention. Soon after, though, he got\n \n1\n\nthe ear of Stalin, who approved. Suddenly, in June, the Soviet press was filled with articles\npraising the new scheme. In August, the Council of Peoples’ Commissars ordered that the\ncontinuous workweek be brought into immediate effect, during the height of enthusiasm for\nthe Plan, whose goals the new schedule seemed guaranteed to forward.\nE\nThe idea seemed simple enough but turned out to be very complicated in practice.\nObviously, the workers couldn’t be made to work seven days a week, nor should their total\nwork hours be increased. The solution was ingenious: a new five-day week would have the\nworkers on the job for four days, with the fifth day free; holidays would be reduced from ten\nto five, and the extra hour off on the eve of rest days would be abolished. Staggering the\nrest-days between groups of workers meant that each worker would spend the same\nnumber of hours on the job, but the factories would be working a full 360 days a year\ninstead of 300. The 360 divided neatly into 72 five-day weeks. Workers in each\nestablishment (at first factories, then stores and offices) were divided into five groups, each\nassigned a colour which appeared on the new Uninterrupted Work Week calendars\ndistributed all over the country. Colour-coding was a valuable mnemonic device since\nworkers might have trouble remembering what their day off was going to be, for it would\nchange every week. A glance at the colour on the calendar would reveal the free day, and\nallow workers to plan their activities. This system, however, did not apply to construction or\nseasonal occupations, which followed a six-day week, or to factories or mines which had to\nclose regularly for maintenance: they also had a six-day week, whether interrupted (with\nthe same day off for everyone) or continuous. In all cases, though, Sunday was treated like\nany other day.\nF\nOfficial propaganda touted the material and cultural benefits of the new scheme. Workers\nwould get more rest; production and employment would increase (for more workers would\nbe needed to keep the factories running continuously); the standard of living would\nimprove. Leisure time would be more rationally employed, for cultural activities (theatre,\nclubs, sports) would no longer have to be crammed into a weekend, but could flourish\nevery day, with their facilities far less crowded. Shopping would be easier for the same\nreasons. Ignorance and superstition, as represented by organized religion, would suffer a\nmortal blow, since 80 per cent of the workers would be on the job on any given Sunday.\nThe only objection concerned the family, where normally more than one member was\nworking: well, the Soviets insisted, the narrow family was har less important than the vast\ncommon good and besides, arrangements could be made for husband and wife to share a\ncommon schedule. In fact, the regime had long wanted to weaken or sideline the two\ngreatest potential threats to its total dominance: organised religion and the nuclear family.\nReligion succumbed, but the family, as even Stalin finally had to admit, proved much more\nresistant.\nG\nThe continuous work week, hailed as a Utopia where time itself was conquered and the\nsluggish Sunday abolished forever, spread like an epidemic. According to official figures,\n63 per cent of industrial workers were so employed by April 1930; in June, all industry was\nordered to convert during the next year. The fad reached its peak in October when it\naffected 73 per cent of workers. In fact, many managers simply claimed that their factories\n \n2\n\nhad gone over to the new week, without actually applying it. Conforming to the demands of\nthe Plan was important; practical matters could wait. By then, though, problems were\nbecoming obvious. Most serious (though never officially admitted), the workers hated it.\nCoordination of family schedules was virtually impossible and usually ignored, so husbands\nand wives only saw each other before or after work; rest days were empty without any\nloved ones to share them – even friends were likely to be on a different schedule.\nConfusion reigned: the new plan was introduced haphazardly, with some factories\noperating five-, six- and seven-day weeks at the same time, and the workers often not\ngetting their rest days at all.\nH\nThe Soviet government might have ignored all that (It didn’t depend on public approval),\nbut the new week was far from having the vaunted effect on production. With the\ncomplicated rotation system, the work teams necessarily found themselves doing different\nkinds of work in successive weeks. Machines, no longer consistently in the hands of people\nhow knew how to tend them, were often poorly maintained or even broken. Workers lost a\nsense of responsibility for the special tasks they had normally performed.\nI\nAs a result, the new week started to lose ground. Stalin’s speech of June 1931, which\ncriticised the “depersonalised labor” its too hasty application had brought, marked the\nbeginning of the end. In November, the government ordered the widespread adoption of\nthe six-day week, which had its own calendar, with regular breaks on the 6th, 12th, 18th,\n24th, and 30th, with Sunday usually as a working day. By July 1935, only 26 per cent of\nworkers still followed the continuous schedule, and the six-day week was soon on its way\nout. Finally, in 1940, as part of the general reversion to more traditional methods, both the\ncontinuous five-day week and the novel six-day week were abandoned, and Sunday\nreturned as the universal day of rest. A bold but typically ill-conceived experiment was at an\nend.\n \n3",
