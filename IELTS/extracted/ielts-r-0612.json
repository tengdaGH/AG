  "passage_text": "Reading Practice\n \nWater Filter\n \nA. An ingenious invention is set to bring clean water to the third world, and while the\nscience may be cutting edge, the materials are extremely down to earth. A handful of clay\nyesterday’s coffee grounds and some cow manure are the ingredients that could bring\nclean, safe drinking water to much of the third world.\nB. The simple new technology, developed by ANU materials scientist Mr. Tony Flynn,\nallows water filters to be made from commonly available materials and fired on the ground\nusing cow manure as the source of heat, without the need for a kiln. The filters have been\ntested and shown to remove common pathogens (disease-producing organisms) including\nE-coli. Unlike other water filtering devices, the filters are simple and inexpensive to make.\n“They are very simple to explain and demonstrate and can be made by anyone, anywhere,”\nsays Mr. Flynn. “They don’t require any western technology. All you need is terracotta clay,\na compliant cow and a match.”\nC. The production of the filters is extremely simple. Take a handful of dry, crushed clay, mix\nit with a handful of organic material, such as used tea leaves, coffee grounds or rice hulls,\nadd enough water to make a stiff biscuit-like mixture and form a cylindrical pot that has one\nend closed, then dry it in the sun. According to Mr. Flynn, used coffee grounds have given\nthe best results to date. Next, surround the pots with straw; put them in a mound of cow\nmanure, light the straw and then top up the burning manure as required. In less than 60\nminutes the filters are finished. The walls of the finished pot should be about as thick as an\nadult’s index. The properties of cow manure are vital as the fuel can reach a temperature of\n700 degrees in half an hour and will be up to 950 degrees after another 20 to 30 minutes.\nThe manure makes a good fuel because it is very high in organic material that bums readily\nand quickly; the manure has to be dry and is best used exactly as found in the field, there is\nno need to break it up or process it any further.\nD. “A potter’s din is an expensive item and can could take up to four or five hours to get\nupto 800 degrees. It needs expensive or scarce fuel, such as gas or wood to heat it and\nexperience to run it. With no technology, no insulation and nothing other than a pile of cow\nmanure and a match, none of these restrictions apply,” Mr. Flynn says.\nE. It is also helpful that, like terracotta clay and organic material, cow dung is freely\navailable across the developing world. “A cow is a natural fuel factory. My understanding is\nthat cow dung as a fuel would be pretty much the same wherever you would find it.” Just as\nusing manure as a fuel for domestic uses is not a new idea, the porosity of clay is\nsomething that potters have known about for years, and something that as a former\nceramics lecturer in the ANU School of Art, Mr. Flynn is well aware of. The difference is\nthat rather than viewing the porous nature of the material as a problem — after all not many\npeople want a pot that won’t hold water — his filters capitalize on this property.\nF. Other commercial ceramic filters do exist, but, even if available, with prices starting at\nUS$5 each, they are often outside the budgets of most people in the developing world. The\nfiltration process is simple, but effective. The basic principle is that there are passages\nthrough the filter that are wide enough for water droplets to pass through, but too narrow for\n \n1\n\n \npathogens. Tests with the deadly E-coli bacterium have seen the filters remove 96.4 to\n99.8 per cent of the pathogen — well within safe levels. Using only one filter it takes two\nhours to filter a litre of water. The use of organic material, which burns away after firing,\nhelps produce the structure in which pathogens will become trapped. It overcomes the\npotential problems of finer clays that may not let water through and also means that cracks\nare soon halted. And like clay and cow dung, it is universally available.\nG. The invention was born out of a World Vision project involving the Manatuto community\nin East Timor The charity wanted to help set up a small industry manufacturing water filters,\nbut initial research found the local clay to be too fine — a problem solved by the addition of\norganic material. While the AF problems of producing a working ceramic filter in East Timor\nwere overcome, the solution was kiln-based and particular to that community’s materials\nand couldn’t be applied elsewhere. Manure firing, with no requirement for a kiln, has made\nthis zero technology approach available anywhere it is needed. With all the components\nbeing widely available, Mr. Flynn says there is no reason the technology couldn’t be\napplied throughout the developing world, and with no plans to patent his idea, there will be\nno legal obstacles to it being adopted in any community that needs it. “Everyone has a right\nto clean water, these filters have the potential to enable anyone in the world to drink water\nsafely,” says Mr. Flynn.\n \n2",
