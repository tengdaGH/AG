Prior to the potato blight, one of the main concerns in Ireland was\noverpopulation. In the early 1500s, the country’s population was estimated at less than\nthree million, but by 1840 this number had nearly tripled. The bountiful potato crop, which\ncontains almost all of the nutrients that a person needs for survival, was largely to blame\nfor the population growth. However, within five years of the failed crop of 1845, the\npopulation of Ireland was reduced by a quarter. A number of factors contributed to the\nplummet of the Irish population, namely the Irish dependency on the potato crop, the British\ntenure system, and the inadequate relief efforts of the English.\nB\nIt is not known exactly how or when the potato was first introduced to Europe, however, the\ngeneral assumption is that it arrived on a Spanish ship sometime in the 1600s. For more\nthan one hundred years, Europeans believed that potatoes belonged to a botanical family\nof a poisonous breed. It was not until Marie Antoinette wore potato blossoms in her hair in\nthe mid-eighteenth century that potatoes became a novelty. By the late 1700s, the dietary\nvalue of the potato had been discovered, and the monarchs of Europe ordered the\nvegetable to be widely planted.\nC\nBy 1800, the vast majority of the Irish population had become dependent on the potato as\nits primary staple. It wasn’t uncommon for an Irish potato farmer to consume more than six\npounds of potatoes a day. Families stored potatoes for the winter and even fed potatoes to\ntheir livestock. Because of this dependency, the unexpected potato blight of 1845\ndevastated the Irish. Investigators at first suggested that the blight was caused by static\nenergy, smoke from railroad trains, or vapors from underground volcanoes; however, the\nroot cause was later discovered as an airborne fungus that traveled from Mexico. Not only\ndid the disease destroy the potato crops, it also infected all of the potatoes in storage at the\ntime. Their families were dying from famine, but weakened farmers had retained little of\ntheir agricultural skills to harvest other crops. Those who did manage to grow things such\nas oats, wheat, and barley relied on earnings from these exported crops to keep their\nrented homes.\nD\nWhile the potato blight generated mass starvation among the Irish, the people were held\ncaptive to their poverty by the British tenure system. Following the Napoleonic Wars of\n1815, the English had turned their focus to their colonial land holdings. British landowners\nrealized that the best way to profit from these holdings was to extract the resources and\nexports and charge expensive rents and taxes for people to live on the land. Under the\ntenure system, Protestant landlords owned 95 percent of the Irish land, which was divided\nup into five-acre plots for the people to live and farm on. As the population of Ireland grew,\nhowever, the plots were continuously subdivided into smaller parcels. Living conditions\n \n1\n\ndeclined dramatically, and families were forced to move to less fertile land where almost\nnothing but the potato would grow.\nE\nDuring this same period of colonization. The Penal Laws were also instituted as a means of\nweakening the Irish spirit. Under the Penal Laws, Irish peasants were denied basic human\nrights, such as the right to speak their own native language, seek certain kinds of\nemployment, practice their faith, receive education, and own land. Despite the famine that\nwas devastating Ireland, the landlords had little compassion or sympathy for tenants unable\nto pay their rent. Approximately 500,000 Irish tenants were evicted by their landlords\nbetween 1845 and 1847. Many of these people also had their homes burned down and\nwere put in jail for overdue rent.\n  \nF\nThe majority of the British officials in the 1840s adopted the laissez-faire philosophy, which\nsupported a policy of nonintervention in the Irish plight. Prime Minister Sir Robert Peel was\nan exception. He showed compassion toward the Irish by making a move to repeal the\nCorn Laws, which had been put in place to protect British grain producers from the\ncompetition of foreign markets. For this hasty decision, Peel quickly lost the support of the\nBritish people and was forced to resign. The new Prime Minister, Lord John Russell,\nallowed assistant Charles Trevelyan to take complete control over all of the relief efforts in\nIreland. Trevelyan believed that the Irish situation should be left to Providence. Claiming\nthat it would be dangerous to let the Irish become dependent on other countries, he even\ntook steps to close food depots that were selling corn and to redirect shipments of com that\nwere already on their way to Ireland. A few relief programs were eventually implemented,\nsuch as soup kitchens and 1 workhouses; however, these were poorly run institutions that\nfacilitated the spread of disease, tore apart families, and offered inadequate food supplies\nconsidering the extent of Ireland’s shortages.\nG\nMany of the effects of the Irish potato famine are still evident today. Descendants of those\nwho fled Ireland during the 1840s are dispersed all over the world. Some of the homes that\nwere evacuated by absentee landlords still sit abandoned in the Irish hills.
