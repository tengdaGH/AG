A student can\nprepare for a career in resort management, engineering, interior design, accounting, music,\nlaw enforcement, you name it. But what would the founders of these two institutions have\nthought of a course called Arson for Profit’? I kid you not: we have it on the books. Any\nundergraduates who have met the academic requirements can sign up for the course in our\nprogram in 'fire science’.\nB\nNaturally, the course is intended for prospective arson investigators, who can learn all the\ntricks of the trade for detecting whether a fire was deliberately set, discovering who did it,\nand establishing a chain of evidence for effective prosecution in a court of law. But wouldn’t\nthis also be the perfect course for prospective arsonists to sign up for? My point is not to\ncriticize academic programs in fire science: they are highly welcome as part of the\nincreasing professionalization of this and many other occupations. However, it’s not\nunknown for a firefighter to torch a building. This example suggests how dishonest and\nillegal behavior, with the help of higher education, can creep into every aspect of public and\nbusiness life.\nC\nI realized this anew when I was invited to speak before a class in marketing, which is\nanother of our degree programs. The regular instructor is a colleague who appreciates the\nkind of ethical perspective I can bring as a philosopher. There are endless ways I could\nhave approached this assignment, but I took my cue from the title of the course: 'Principles\nof Marketing’. It made me think to ask the students, 'Is marketing principled?’ After all, a\nsubject matter can have principles in the sense of being codified, having rules, as with\nfootball or chess, without being principled in the sense of being ethical. Many of the\nstudents immediately assumed that the answer to my question about marketing principles\nwas obvious: no. Just look at the ways in which everything under the sun has been\nmarketed; obviously it need not be done in a principled (=ethical) fashion.\nD\nIs that obvious? I made the suggestion, which may sound downright crazy in light of the\nevidence, that perhaps marketing is by definition principled. My inspiration for this\njudgement is the philosopher Immanuel Kant, who argued that any body of knowledge\nconsists of an end (or purpose) and a means.\nE\nLet us apply both the terms 'means' and ‘end' to marketing. The students have signed up\nfor a course in order to learn how to market effectively. But to what end? There seem to be\ntwo main attitudes toward that question. One is that the answer is obvious: the purpose of\nmarketing is to sell things and to make money. The other attitude is that the purpose of\n \n1\n\nmarketing is irrelevant: Each person comes to the program and course with his or her own\nplans, and these need not even concern the acquisition of marketing expertise as such. My\nproposal, which I believe would also be Kant's, is that neither of these attitudes captures\nthe significance of the end to the means for marketing. A field of knowledge or a\nprofessional endeavor is defined by both the means and the end;hence both deserve\nscrutiny. Students need to study both how to achieve X, and also what X is.\nF\nIt is at this point that ‘Arson for Profit’ becomes supremely relevant. That course is\npresumably all about means: how to detect and prosecute criminal activity. It is therefore\nassumed that the end is good in an ethical sense. When I ask fire science students to\narticulate the end, or purpose, of their field, they eventually generalize to something like,\n‘The safety and welfare of society,’ which seems right. As we have seen, someone could\nuse the very same knowledge of means to achieve a much less noble end, such as\npersonal profit via destructive, dangerous, reckless activity. But we would not call that\nfirefighting. We have a separate word for it: arson. Similarly, if you employed the ‘principles\nof marketing’ in an unprincipled way, you would not be doing marketing. We have another\nterm for it: fraud. Kant gives the example of a doctor and a poisoner, who use the identical\nknowledge to achieve their divergent ends. We would say that one is practicing medicine,\nthe other, murder.\n \n2",
