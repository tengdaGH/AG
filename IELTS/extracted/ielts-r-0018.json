  "passage_text": "Reading Practice\n \nAmateur Naturalists\n \nFrom the results of an annual Alaskan betting contest to sightings of migratory\nbirds, ecologists are using a wealth of unusual data to predict the impact of climate\nchange.\n \nA Tim Sparks slides a small leather-bound notebook out of an envelope. The book's\nyellowing pages contain bee-keeping notes made between 1941 and 1969 by the late\nWalter Coates of Kilworth, Leicestershire. He adds it to his growing pile of local journals,\nbirdwatchers' lists and gardening diaries. \"We're uncovering about one major new record\neach month,\" he says, \"I still get surprised.\" Around two centuries before Coates, Robert\nMarsham, a landowner from Norfolk in the east of England, began recording the life cycles\nof plants and animals on his estate - when the first wood anemones flowered, the dates on\nwhich the oaks burst into leaf and the rooks began nesting. Successive Marshams\ncontinued compiling these notes for 211 years.\n \nB Today, such records are being put to uses that their authors could not possibly have\nexpected. These data sets, and others like them, are proving invaluable to ecologists\ninterested in the timing of biological events, or phenology. By combining the records with\nclimate data, researchers can reveal how, for example, changes in temperature affect the\narrival of spring, allowing ecologists to make improved predictions about the impact of\nclimate change. A small band of researchers is combing through hundreds of years of\nrecords taken by thousands of amateur naturalists. And more systematic projects have also\nstarted up, producing an overwhelming response. \"The amount of interest is almost\nfrightening,\" says Sparks, a climate researcher at the Centre for Ecology and Hydrology in\nMonks Wood, Cambridgeshire.\n \nC Sparks first became aware of the army of \"closet phenologists”, as he describes them,\nwhen a retiring colleague gave him the Marsham records. He now spends much of his time\nfollowing leads from one historical data set to another. As news of his quest spreads,\npeople tip him off to other historical records, and more amateur phenologists come out of\ntheir closets. The British devotion to recording and collecting makes his job easier - one\nman from Kent sent him 30 years' worth of kitchen calendars, on which he had noted the\ndate that his neighbour's magnolia tree flowered.\n \nD Other researchers have unearthed data from equally odd sources. Rafe Sagarin, an\necologist at Stanford University in California, recently studied records of a betting contest in\nwhich participants attempt to guess the exact time at which a specially erected wooden\ntripod will fall through the surface of a thawing river. The competition has taken place\nannually on the Tenana River in Alaska since 1917, and analysis of the results showed that\nthe thaw now arrives five days earlier than it did when the contest began.\nE Overall, such records have helped to show that, compared with 20 years ago, a raft of\nnatural events now occur earlier across much of the northern hemisphere, from the\nopening of leaves to the return of birds from migration and the emergence of butterflies\nfrom hibernation. The data can also hint at how nature will change in the future. Together\nwith models of climate change, amateurs' records could help guide conservation. Terry\nRoot, an ecologist at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor, has collected birdwatchers'\ncounts of wildfowl taken between 1955 and 1996 on seasonal ponds in the American\nMidwest and combined them with climate data and models of future warming. Her analysis\n \n1\n\n \nshows that the increased droughts that the models predict could halve the breeding\npopulations at the ponds. \"The number of waterfowl in North America will most probably\ndrop significantly with global warming,\" she says.\n \nF But not all professionals are happy to use amateur data. \"A lot of scientists won't touch\nthem, they say they're too full of problems,\" says Root. Because different observers can\nhave different ideas of what constitutes, for example, an open snowdrop. \"The biggest\nconcern with ad hoc observations is how carefully and systematically they were taken,\"\nsays Mark Schwartz of the University of Wisconsin, Milwaukee, who studies the\ninteractions between plants and climate. \"We need to know pretty precisely what a person's\nbeen observing - if they just say 'I noted when the leaves came out', it might not be that\nuseful.\" Measuring the onset of autumn can be particularly problematic because deciding\nwhen leaves change colour is a more subjective process than noting when they appear.\n \nG Overall, most phenologists are positive about the contribution that amateurs can make.\n\"They get at the raw power of science: careful observation of the natural world,\" says\nSagarin. But the professionals also acknowledge the need for careful quality control. Root,\nfor example, tries to gauge the quality of an amateur archive by interviewing its collector.\n\"You always have to worry - things as trivial as vacations can affect measurement. I\ndisregard a lot of records because they're not rigorous enough,\" she says. Others suggest\nthat the right statistics can iron out some of the problems with amateur data. Together with\ncolleagues at Wageningen University in the Netherlands, environmental scientist Arnold\nvan Vliet is developing statistical techniques to account for the uncertainty in amateur\nphenological data. With the enthusiasm of amateur phenologists evident from past records,\nprofessional researchers are now trying to create standardised recording schemes for\nfuture efforts. They hope that well-designed studies will generate a volume of observations\nlarge enough to drown out the idiosyncrasies of individual recorders. The data are cheap to\ncollect, and can provide breadth in space, time and range of species. \"It's very difficult to\ncollect data on a large geographical scale without enlisting an army of observers,\" says\nRoot.\nH Phenology also helps to drive home messages about climate change. \"Because the\npublic understand these records, they accept them,\" says Sparks.\nIt can also illustrate potentially unpleasant consequences, he adds, such as the finding that\nmore rat infestations are reported to local councils in warmer years. And getting people\ninvolved is great for public relations. \"People are thrilled to think that the data they've been\ncollecting as a hobby can be used for something scientific - it empowers them,\" says Root.\n \n2",
