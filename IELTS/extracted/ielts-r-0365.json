They believe that the best we can do is keep it at a reasonable level, and at\npresent the only serious option for doing this is cutting back on our carbon emissions. But\nwhile a few countries are making major strides in this regard, the majority are having great\ndifficulty even stemming the rate of increase, let alone reversing it. Consequently, an\nincreasing number of scientists are beginning to explore the alternative of geo-engineering\n— a term which generally refers to the intentional large-scale manipulation of the\nenvironment. According to its proponents, geo-engineering is the equivalent of a backup\ngenerator: if Plan A - reducing our dependency on fossil fuels - fails, we require a Plan B,\nemploying grand schemes to slow down or reverse the process of global warming.\nB\nGeo-engineering; has been shown to work, at least on a small localised scale. For\ndecades, MayDay parades in Moscow have taken place under clear blue skies, aircraft\nhaving deposited dry ice, silver iodide and cement powder to disperse clouds. Many of the\nschemes now suggested look to do the opposite, and reduce the amount of sunlight\nreaching the planet. The most eye-catching idea of all is suggested by Professor Roger\nAngel of the University of Arizona. His scheme would employ up to 16 trillion minute\nspacecraft, each weighing about one gram, to form a transparent, sunlight-refracting\nsunshade in an orbit 1.5 million km above the Earth. This could, argues Angel, reduce the\namount of light reaching the Earth by two per cent.\nC\nThe majority of geo-engineering projects so far carried out — which include planting forests\nin deserts and depositing iron in the ocean to stimulate the growth of algae - have focused\non achieving a general cooling of the Earth. But some look specifically at reversing the\nmelting at the poles, particularly the Arctic. The reasoning is that if you replenish the ice\nsheets and frozen waters of the high latitudes, more light will be reflected back into space,\nso reducing the warming of the oceans and atmosphere.\nD\nThe concept of releasing aerosol sprays into the stratosphere above the Arctic has been\nproposed by several scientists. This would involve using sulphur or hydrogen sulphide\naerosols so that sulphur dioxide would form clouds, which would, in turn, lead to a global\ndimming. The idea is modelled on historic volcanic explosions, such as that of Mount\nPinatubo in the Philippines in 1991, which led to a short-term cooling of global\ntemperatures by 0.5 °C. Scientists have also scrutinised whether it's possible to preserve\nthe ice sheets of Greenland with reinforced high-tension cables, preventing icebergs from\nmoving into the sea. Meanwhile in the Russian Arctic, geo-engineering plans include the\nplanting of millions of birch trees. Whereas the -regions native evergreen pines shade the\n \n1\n\nsnow an absorb radiation, birches would shed their leaves in winter, thus enabling radiation\nto be reflected by the snow. Re-routing Russian rivers to increase cold water flow to ice-\nforming areas could also be used to slow down warming, say some climate scientists.\nE\nBut will such schemes ever be implemented? Generally speaking, those who are most\ncautious about geo-engineering are the scientists involved in the research. Angel says that\nhis plan is ‘no substitute for developing renewable energy: the only permanent solution'.\nAnd Dr Phil Rasch of the US-based Pacific Northwest National Laboratory is equally\nguarded about the role of geo-engineering: 'I think all of us agree that if we were to end\ngeo-engineering on a given day, then the planet would return to its pre-engineered\ncondition very rapidly, and probably within ten to twenty years. That’s certainly something\nto worry about.’\nF\nThe US National Center for Atmospheric Research has already suggested that the\nproposal to inject sulphur into the atmosphere might affect rainfall patterns across the\ntropics and the Southern Ocean. ‘Geo-engineering plans to inject stratospheric aerosols or\nto seed clouds would act to cool the planet, and act to increase the extent of sea ice,’ says\nRasch. ‘But all the models suggest some impact on the distribution of precipitation.’\nG\nA further risk with geo-engineering projects is that you can “overshoot Y says Dr Dan Hunt,\nfrom the University of Bristol’s School of Geophysical Sciences, who has studied the likely\nimpacts of the sunshade and aerosol schemes on the climate. ‘You may bring global\ntemperatures back to pre-industrial levels, but the risk is that the poles will still be warmer\nthan they should be and the tropics will be cooler than before industrialisation.’To avoid\nsuch a scenario,” Hunt says, “Angel’s project would have to operate at half strength; all of\nwhich reinforces his view that the best option is to avoid the need for geo-engineering\naltogether.”\nH\nThe main reason why geo-engineering is supported by many in the scientific community is\nthat most researchers have little faith in the ability of politicians to agree - and then bring in\n— the necessary carbon cuts. Even leading conservation organisations see the value of\ninvestigating the potential of geo-engineering. According to Dr Martin Sommerkorn, climate\nchange advisor for the World Wildlife Fund’s International Arctic Programme, ‘Human-\ninduced climate change has brought humanity to a position where we shouldn’t exclude\nthinking thoroughly about this topic and its possibilities.’\n \n2",
