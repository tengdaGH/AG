  "passage_text": "Reading Practice\n \nThe moto car\nThe start of the automobile's history went all the way back to 1769 when automobiles\nrunning on the steam engine were invented as carriers for human transport In 1806, the\nfirst batch of cars powered by an internal combustion engine came into being, which\npioneered the introduction of the widespread modem petrol-fueled internal combustion\nengine in 1885.\nIt is generally acknowledged that the first practical automobiles equipped with petrol/gaso-\nline-powered internal combustion engines were invented almost at the same time by\ndifferent German inventors who were Working on their own. Karl Bfenz first built the\nautomobile in 1885 in Mannheim. Benz attained a patent for his invention on 29 January\n1886, and in 1888, he started to produce automobiles in a company that later became the\nrenowned Mercedes-Benz.\nAs this century began, the automobile industry marched into the transportation market for\nthe wealth. Drivers at that time were an adventurous bunch; they would go out regardless\nof the weather condition even if they weren’t even protected by an enclosed body or a\nconvertible top. Everybody in the community knew who owned what car, and cars\nimmediately became a symbol of identity and status. Later, cars became more popular\namong the public since it allowed people to travel whenever and wherever they wanted.\nThus, the price of automobiles in Europe and North America kept dropping, and more\npeople from the middle class could afford them. This was especially attributed to Henry\nFord who did two crucial things. First, he set the price as reasonable as possible for his\ncars; second, he paid his employees enough salaries so that they could afford the cars\nmade by their very own hands.\nThe trend of interchangeable parts and mass production in an assembly line style had been\nled by America, and from 1914, this concept was significantly reinforced by Henry Ford.\nThis large-scale, production-line manufacture of affordable automobiles was debuted. A\nFord car would come off all assembled from the line every 15 minutes, an interval shorter\nthan any of the former methods. Not only did it raise productivity, but also cut down on the\nrequirement for manpower. Ford significantly lowered the chance of injury by carrying out\ncomplicated safety procedures in production—particularly assigning workers to specific\nlocations rather than giving them the freedom to wander around. This mixture of high\nwages and high efficiency was known as Fordism, which provided a valuable lesson for\nmost major industries.\nThe first Jeep automobile that came out as the prototype Bantam BRC was the primary\nlight 4-wheel-drive automobile of the U.S. Army and Allies, and during World War II and the\npostwar period, its sale skyrocketed. Since then, plenty of Jeep derivatives with similar\nmilitary and civilian functions have been created and kept upgraded in terms of overall\nperformance in other nations.\nThrough all the 1950s, engine power and automobile rates grew higher, designs evolved\ninto a more integrated and artful form, and cars were spreading globally. In the 1960s, the\nlandscape changed as Detroit was confronted with foreign competition. The European\nmanufacturers, used the latest technology, and Japan came into the picture as a dedicated\ncar-making country. General Motors, Chrysler, and Ford dabbled with radical tiny cars such\nas the GM A-bodies with little success. As joint ventures such as the British Motor\n \n1\n\n \n \nCorporation unified the market, captive imports and badge imports swept all over the US\nand the UK. BMC first launched a revolutionary space-friendly Mini in 1959, which turned\nout to harvest large global sales. Previously remaining under the Austin and Morris names,\nMini later became an individual marque in 1969. The trend of corporate consolidation\nlanded in Italy when niche makers such as Maserati, Ferrari, and Lancia were bought by\nlarger enterprises. By the end of the 20th century, there had been a sharp fall in the\nnumber of automobile marques.\nIn the US, car performance dominated marketing, justified by the typical cases of pony cars\nand muscle cars. However, in the 1970s, everything changed as the American automobile\nindustry suffered from the 1973 oil crisis, competition with Japanese and European imports,\nautomobile emission control regulations* and moribund innovation. The irony in all this was\nthat full-size sedans such as Cadillac and Lincoln scored a huge comeback between the\nyears of economic crisis.\nIn terms of technology, the most mentionable developments that postwar era had seen\nwere the widespread use of independent suspensions, broader application of fuel injection,\nand a growing emphasis on safety in automobile design. Mazda achieved many triumphs\nwith its engine firstly installed in the fore-wheel, though it gained itself a reputation as a\ngas-guzzler.\nThe modem era also has witnessed a sharp elevation of fuel power in the modem engine\nmanagement system with the. help of the computer. Nowadays, most automobiles in use\nare powered by an internal combustion engine, fueled by gasoline or diesel. Toxic gas from\nboth fuels is known to pollute the air and is responsible for climate change as well as global\nwarming.\n \n2",
