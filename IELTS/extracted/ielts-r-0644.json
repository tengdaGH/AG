  "passage_text": "Reading Practice\n \nWillpower\nA   \nAlthough willpower does not shape our decisions, it determines whether and how long we\ncan follow through on them. It almost single-handedly determines life outcomes.\nInterestingly, research suggests the general population is indeed aware of how essential\nwillpower is to their wellbeing; survey participants routinely identify a ‘lack of willpower’ as\nthe major impediment to making beneficial life changes. There are, however,\nmisunderstandings surrounding the nature of willpower and how we can acquire more of it.\nThere is a widespread misperception, for example, that increased leisure time would lead\nto subsequent increases in willpower.\nB   \nAlthough the concept of willpower is often explained through single-word terms, such as\n‘resolve’ or ‘drive’, it refers in fact to a variety of behaviours and situations. There is a\ncommon perception that willpower entails resisting some kind of a ‘treat’, such as a sugary\ndrink or a lazy morning in bed, in favour of decisions that we know are better for us, such\nas drinking water or going to the gym. Of course this is a familiar phenomenon for all. Yet\nwillpower also involves elements such as overriding negative thought processes, biting\nyour tongue in social situations, or persevering through a difficult activity. At the heart of\nany exercise of willpower, however, is the notion of ‘delayed gratification’, which involves\nresisting immediate satisfaction for a course that will yield greater or more permanent\nsatisfaction in the long run.\nC   \nScientists are making general investigations into why some individuals are better able than\nothers to delay gratification and thus employ their willpower, but the genetic or\nenvironmental origins of this ability remain a mystery for now. Some groups who are\nparticularly vulnerable to reduced willpower capacity, such as those with addictive\npersonalities, may claim a biological origin for their problems. What is clear is that levels of\nwillpower typically remain consistent over time (studies tracking individuals from early\nchildhood to their adult years demonstrate a remarkable consistency in willpower abilities).\nIn the short term, however, our ability to draw on willpower can fluctuate dramatically due to\nfactors such as fatigue, diet and stress. Indeed, research by Matthew Gailliot suggests that\nwillpower, even in the absence of physical activity, both requires and drains blood glucose\nlevels, suggesting that willpower operates more or less like a ‘muscle’, and, like a muscle,\nrequires fuel for optimum functioning.\nD   \nThese observations lead to an important question: if the strength of our willpower at the\nage of thirty-five is somehow pegged to our ability at the age of four, are all efforts to\nimprove our willpower certain to prove futile? According to newer research, this is not\nnecessarily the case. Gregory M. Walton, for example, found that a single verbal cue –\ntelling research participants how strenuous mental tasks could ‘energise’ them for further\nchallenging activities – made a profound difference in terms of how much willpower\nparticipants could draw upon to complete the activity. Just as our willpower is easily\n \n1\n\ndrained by negative influences, it appears that willpower can also be boosted by other\nprompts, such as encouragement or optimistic self-talk.\nE   \nStrengthening willpower thus relies on a two-pronged approach: reducing negative\ninfluences and improving positive ones. One of the most popular and effective methods\nsimply involves avoiding willpower depletion triggers, and is based on the old adage, ‘out of\nsight, out of mind’. In one study, workers who kept a bowl of enticing candy on their desks\nwere far more likely to indulge than those who placed it in a desk drawer. It also appears\nthat finding sources of motivation from within us may be important. In another study, Mark\nMuraven found that those who felt compelled by an external authority to exert self-control\nexperienced far greater rates of willpower depletion than those who identified their own\nreasons for taking a particular course of action. This idea that our mental convictions can\ninfluence willpower was borne out by Veronika Job. Her research indicates that those who\nthink that willpower is a finite resource exhaust their supplies of this commodity long before\nthose who do not hold this opinion.\nF   \nWillpower is clearly fundamental to our ability to follow through on our decisions but, as\npsychologist Roy Baumeister has discovered, a lack of willpower may not be the sole\nimpediment every time our good intentions fail to manifest themselves. A critical precursor,\nhe suggests, is motivation – if we are only mildly invested in the change we are trying to\nmake, our efforts are bound to fall short. This may be why so many of us abandon our New\nYear’s Resolutions – if these were actions we really wanted to take, rather than things we\nfelt we ought to be doing, we would probably be doing them already. In addition, Muraven\nemphasises the value of monitoring progress towards a desired result, such as by using a\nfitness journal, or keeping a record of savings toward a new purchase. The importance of\nmotivation and monitoring cannot be overstated. Indeed, it appears that, even when our\nwillpower reserves are entirely depleted, motivation alone may be sufficient to keep us on\nthe course we originally chose.\n \n2",
