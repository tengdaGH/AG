Its ruling should apply only if the treatment was likely to\nbe less effective, or not work because of an unhealthy habit The agency also insisted that\nits decision was not an edict for the whole NHS but guidance for its own appraisal\ncommittees when reaching judgements on new drugs or procedures. But the effect is likely\nto be the same.\nNICE is a powerful body and the cause of much controversy. It is seen by some as a new\nway of rationing NHS treatment Across the UK, primary care trusts (PCTs) regularly wait\nfor many months for a NICE decision before agreeing to fund a new treatment. One group\nof primary care trusts is ahead of NICE. Three PCTs in east Suffolk have already decided\nthat obese people would not be entitled to have hip or knee replacements unless they lost\nweight The group said the risks of operating on them were greater, the surgery may be less\nsuccessful and the joints would wear out sooner. It was acknowledged that the decision\nwould also save money.\nNICE said no priority should be given to patients based on income, social class or social\nroles at different ages when considering the cost effectiveness of a treatment. Patients\nshould not be discriminated against on the grounds of age either, unless age has a direct\nrelevance to the condition. NICE has already ruled that IVF should be available on the NHS\nto women aged 23 to 39 as the treatment has less chance of success in older women. It\nalso recommends that flu drugs should be available to over-65s, as older people are more\nvulnerable.\nBut NICE also said that if self-inflicted factors meant that drugs or treatment would be less\nclinically and cost effective, this may need to be considered when producing advice for the\nNHS.

Even then, age should only be\nmentioned when it provides the only practical ‘marker1 of risk or benefit NICE values\npeople, equally, at all ages.’\nBut Steve Webb, the Liberal Democrat health spokesman, said there was a danger of\nprimary care trusts following the same course of action.

The only circumstances where that may be taken into account is where that\ntreatment may be less effective because of lifestyle choices.’\nJonathan Ellis, the policy manager at Help the Aged, said it was pleased NICE had finally\nshown an understanding of the importance of tackling age discrimination.’While this is a\nmajor feat, there is still some way to go to banish the evident inherent age discrimination\nthat exists within health care services,’he said.The NHS now has much to leam.
