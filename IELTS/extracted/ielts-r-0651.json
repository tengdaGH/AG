  "passage_text": "Reading Practice\n \nZoo conservation programmes\nOne of London Zoo’s recent advertisements caused me some irritation, so patently did it\ndistort reality. Headlined “Without zoos you might as well tell these animals to get stuffed”,\nit was bordered with illustrations of several endangered species and went on to extol the\nmyth that without zoos like London Zoo these animals “will almost certainly disappear\nforever”. With the zoo world’s rather mediocre record on conservation, one might be\nforgiven for being slightly sceptical about such an advertisement.\nZoos were originally created as places of entertainment, and their suggested involvement\nwith conservation didn’t seriously arise until about 30 years ago, when the Zoological\nSociety of London held the first formal international meeting on the subject. Eight years\nlater, a series of world conferences took place, entitled “The Breeding of Endangered\nSpecies”, and from this point onwards conservation became the zoo community’s\nbuzzword. This commitment has now been clear defined in The World Zoo Conservation\nStrategy (WZGS, September 1993), which although an important and welcome document\ndoes seem to be based on an unrealistic optimism about the nature of the zoo industry.\nThe WZCS estimates that there are about 10,000 zoos in the world, of which around 1,000\nrepresent a core of quality collections capable of participating in coordinated conservation\nprogrammes. This is probably the document’s first failing, as I believe that 10,000 is a\nserious underestimate of the total number of places masquerading as zoological\nestablishments. Of course it is difficult to get accurate data but, to put the issue into\nperspective, I have found that, in a year of working in Eastern Europe, I discover fresh zoos\non almost a weekly basis.\nThe second flaw in the reasoning of the WZCS document is the naive faith it places in its\n1,000 core zoos. One would assume that the calibre of these institutions would have been\ncarefully examined, but it appears that the criterion for inclusion on this select list might\nmerely be that the zoo is a member of a zoo federation or association. This might be a\ngood starting point, working on the premise that members must meet certain standards, but\nagain the facts don’t support the theory. The greatly respected American Association of\nZoological Parks and Aquariums (AAZPA) has had extremely dubious members, and in the\nUK the Federation of Zoological Gardens of Great Britain and Ireland has occasionally had\nmembers that have been roundly censured in the national press. These include Robin Hill\nAdventure Park on the Isle of Wight, which many considered the most notorious collection\nof animals in the country. This establishment, which for years was protected by the Isle’s\nlocal council (which viewed it as a tourist amenity), was finally closed down following a\ndamning report by a veterinary inspector appointed under the terms of the Zoo Licensing\nAct 1981. As it was always a collection of dubious repute, one is obliged to reflect upon the\nstandards that the Zoo Federation sets when granting membership. The situation is even\nworse in developing countries where little money is available for redevelopment and it is\nhard to see a way of incorporating collections into the overall scheme of the WZCS.\nEven assuming that the WZCS’s 1,000 core zoos are all of a high standard complete with\nscientific staff and research facilities, trained and dedicated keepers, accommodation that\npermits normal or natural behaviour, and a policy of co-operating fully with one another\nwhat might be the potential for conservation? Colin Tudge, author of Last Animals at the\nZoo (Oxford University Press, 1992), argues that “if the world”s zoos worked together in co-\n \n1\n\noperative breeding programmes, then even without further expansion they could save\naround 2,000 species of endangered land vertebrates’. This seems an extremely optimistic\nproposition from a man who must be aware of the failings and weaknesses of the zoo\nindustry the man who, when a member of the council of London Zoo, had to persuade the\nzoo to devote more of its activities to conservation. Moreover, where are the facts to\nsupport such optimism?\nToday approximately 16 species might be said to have been “saved” by captive breeding\nprogrammes, although a number of these can hardly be looked upon as resounding\nsuccesses. Beyond that, about a further 20 species are being seriously considered for zoo\nconservation programmes. Given that the international conference at London Zoo was held\n30 years ago, this is pretty slow progress, and a long way off Tudge’s target of 2,000.\n \n2",
