  "passage_text": "Reading Practice\n \nPaul Nash\n{A} Paul Nash, the elder son of William Nash and his first wife, Caroline Jackson, was born\nin London on 11th May 1889. His father was a successful lawyer who became the\nRecorder of Abingdon. According to Ronald Blythe: “In 1901 the family returned to its\nnative Buckinghamshire, where the garden of Wood Lane House at Iver Heath, and the\ncountryside of the Chiltern Hills, with its sculptural beeches and chalky contours, were early\ninfluences on the development of the three children. Their lives were overshadowed by\ntheir mother’s mental illness and Nash himself was greatly helped by his nurse who, with\nsome elderly neighbors, introduced him to the universe of plants.”\n \n{B} Nash was educated at St. Paul’s School and the Slade School of Art, where he met\nDora Carrington. Unlike some of his contemporaries at the Slade School, Nash remained\nuntouched by the two post-impressionist exhibitions organized by Roger Fry in 1910 and\n1912. Instead, he was influenced by the work of William Blake. He also became a close\nfriend of Gordon Bottomley, who took a keen interest in his career.\n{C} Nash had his first one-man show, of ink and wash drawings, at the Carfax Gallery in\n1912. The following year he shared an exhibition at the Dorian Leigh Gallery with his\nbrother, John Nash. Myfanwy Piper has added: “Nash had a noteworthy sense of order and\nof the niceties of presentation; his pictures were beautifully framed, drawings mounted, his\nstudio precisely and decoratively tidy, and oddments which he collected were worked up\ninto compositions.”\n{D} Paul Nash was strongly attracted to Dora Carrington: He later recalled: “Carrington…\nwas the dominating personality, I got an introduction to her and eventually won her regard\nby lending her my braces for a fancy-dress party. We were on the top of a bus and she\nwanted them then and there.”\n \n{E} On the outbreak Nash considered the possibility of joining the British Army. He told a\nfriend: “I am not keen to rush off and be a soldier. The whole damnable war is too horrible\nof course and I am all against killing anybody, speaking off-hand, but besides all that I\nbelieve both Jack and I might be more useful as ambulance and red cross men, and to that\nend we are training. Nash enlisted in the Artists’ Rifles. He told Gordon Bottomley: “I have\njoined the Artists’ London Regiment of Territorials, the old Corps which started with\nRossetti, Leighton, and Millais as members in 1860. Every man must do his bit in this\nhorrible business so I have given up painting. There are many nice creatures in my\ncompany and I enjoy the burst of exercise – marching, drilling all day in the open air about\nthe pleasant parts of Regents Park and Hampstead Heath.”\n{F} In March 1917 he was sent to the Western Front Nash, who took part in the offensive at\nYpres, had reached the rank of lieutenant in the Hampshire Regiment by 1916. Whenever\npossible, Nash made sketches of life in the trenches. In May 1917 he was invalided home\nafter a non-military accident. While recuperating in London, Nash worked from his sketches\nto produce a series of war paintings. This work was well-received when exhibited later that\nyear. As a result of this exhibition, Charles Masterman, head of the government’s War\nPropaganda Bureau (WPB), and the advice of Edward Marsh and William Rothenstein, it\n \n1\n\nwas decided to recruit Nash as a war artist. In November 1917 in the immediate aftermath\nof the battle of Passchendaele Nash returned to France.\n{G} Nash was unhappy with his work as a member of the War Propaganda Bureau. He\nwrote at the time: “I am no longer an artist. I am a messenger who will bring back word\nfrom the men who are fighting to those who want the war to go on forever. Feeble,\ninarticulate will be my message, but it will have a bitter truth and may burn their lousy\nsouls.” However, as Myfanwy Piper has pointed out: “The drawings he made then, of shorn\ntrees in ruined and flooded landscapes, were the works that made Nash’s reputation. They\nwere shown at the Leicester Galleries in 1918 together with his first efforts at oil painting, in\nwhich he was self-taught and quickly successful, though his drawings made in the field had\na more immediate public impact.\n \n{H} In 1919 Nash moved to Dymchurch in Kent, beginning his well-known series of pictures\nof the sea, the breakwaters, and the long wall that prevents the sea from flooding Romney\nMarsh. This included the Winter Sea and Dymchurch Steps. Nash also painted the\nlandscapes of the Chiltern Hills. In 1924 and 1928 he had successful exhibitions at the\nLeicester Galleries. Despite this popular acclaim in 1929, his work became more abstract.\nIn 1933 Nash founded Unit One, the group of experimental painters, sculptors, and\narchitects.\n{I} During the Second World War Nash was employed by the Ministry of Information and\nthe Air Ministry and paintings produced by him during this period include the Battle of\nBritain and Totes Meer. His biographer, Myfanwy Piper, has argued: “This war disturbed\nNash but did not change his art as the last one had. His style and his habits were formed,\nand in the new war, he treated his new subjects as he had treated those he had been\nthinking about for so long. His late paintings, both oils, and watercolors are alternately\nbrilliant and somber in color with the light of setting suns and rising moons spreading over\nwooded and hilly landscapes. “Paul Nash died at 35 Boscombe Spa Road, Bournemouth,\non 11th July 1946. \n \n2",
