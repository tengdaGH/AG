  "passage_text": "Reading Practice\n \nThe effects of light on plant and animal species\nLight is important to organisms for two different reasons. Firstly it Is used as a cue for the\ntiming of daily and seasonal rhythms in both plants and animals, and secondly it is used to\nassist growth in plants.\nBreeding in most organisms occurs during a part of the year only, and so a reliable cue is\nneeded to trigger breeding behaviour. Day length is an excellent cue, because it provides a\nperfectly predictable pattern of change within the year. In the temperate zone in spring,\ntemperatures fluctuate greatly from day to day. but day length increases steadily by a\npredictable amount. The seasonal impact of day length on physiological responses is\ncalled photoperiodism, and the amount of experimental evidence for this phenomenon is\nconsiderable. For example, some species of birds’ breeding can be induced even in\nmidwinter simply by increasing day length artificially (Wolfson 1964). Other examples of\nphotoperiodism occur in plants. A short-day plant flowers when the day is less than a\ncertain critical length. A long-day plant flowers after a certain critical day length is\nexceeded. In both cases the critical day length differs from species to species. Plants which\nflower after a period of vegetative growth, regardless of photoperiod, are known as day-\nneutral plants.\nBreeding seasons in animals such as birds have evolved to occupy the part of the year in\nwhich offspring have the greatest chances of survival. Before the breeding season begins,\nfood reserves must be built up to support the energy cost of reproduction, and to provide\nfor young birds both when they are in the nest and after fledging. Thus many temperate-\nzone birds use the increasing day lengths in spring as a cue to begin the nesting cycle,\nbecause this is a point when adequate food resources will be assured.\nThe adaptive significance of photoperiodism in plants is also clear. Short-day plants that\nflower in spring in the temperate zone are adapted to maximising seedling growth during\nthe growing season. Long-day plants are adapted for situations that require fertilization by\ninsects, or a long period of seed ripening. Short-day plants that flower in the autumn in the\ntemperate zone are able to build up food reserves over the growing season and over winter\nas seeds. Day-neutral plants have an evolutionary advantage when the connection\nbetween the favourable period for reproduction and day length is much less certain. For\nexample, desert annuals germinate, flower and seed whenever suitable rainfall occurs,\nregardless of the day length. \nThe breeding season of some plants can be delayed to extraordinary lengths. Bamboos\nare perennial grasses that remain in a vegetative state for many years and then suddenly\nflower, fruit and die (Evans 1976). Every bamboo of the species Chusquea abietifolio on\nthe island of Jamaica flowered, set seed and died during 1884. The next generation of\nbamboo flowered and died between 1916 and 1918, which suggests a vegetative cycle of\nabout 31 years. The climatic trigger for this flowering cycle is not yet known, but the\nadaptive significance is clear. The simultaneous production of masses of bamboo seeds (in\nsome cases lying 12 to 15 centimetres deep on the ground) is more than all the seed-\neating animals can cope with at the time, so that some seeds escape being eaten and grow\nup to form the next generation (Evans 1976).\nThe second reason light is important to organisms is that it is essential for photosynthesis.\nThis is the process by which plants use energy from the sun to convert carbon from soil or\n \n1\n\nwater into organic material for growth. The rate of photosynthesis in a plant can be\nmeasured by calculating the rate of its uptake of carbon. There is a wide range of\nphotosynthetic responses of plants to variations in light intensity. Some plants reach\nmaximal photosynthesis at one-quarter full sunlight, and others, like sugarcane, never\nreach a maximum, but continue to increase photosynthesis rate as light intensity rises.\nPlants in general can be divided into two groups: shade-tolerant species and shade-\nintolerant species. This classification is commonly used in forestry and horticulture. Shade-\ntolerant plants have lower photosynthetic rates and hence have lower growth rates than\nthose of shade-intolerant species. Plant species become adapted to living in a certain kind\nof habitat, and in the process evolve a series of characteristics that prevent them from\noccupying other habitats. Grime (1966) suggests that light may be one of the major\ncomponents directing these adaptations. For example, eastern hemlock seedlings are\nshade-tolerant. They can survive in the forest understorey under very low light levels\nbecause they have a low photosynthetic rate.  \n \n2",
