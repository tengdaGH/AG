Scientists have discovered that prehistoric cave paintings took up to 20,000\nyears to complete. Rather than being created in one session, as archaeologists previously\nthought, many of the works discovered across Europe were produced over hundreds of\ngenerations, who added to, refreshed and painted over the original pieces of art.\nUntil now it has been extremely difficult to pinpoint when prehistoric cave paintings and\ncarvings were created, but a pioneering technique is allowing researchers to date cave art\naccurately for the first time and show how the works were crafted over thousands of years.\nExperts now hope the technique will provide a valuable insight into how early human\nculture developed and changed as the first modern humans moved across Europe around\n40,000 years ago.\nDr Alistair Pike, an archaeologist at Bristol University who is leading the research, said:The\nart gives us a really intimate window into the minds of the individuals who produced it, but\nwhat we don’t know is exactly which individuals they were as we don’t know exactly when\nthe art was created. If we can date the art then we can relate that to the artefacts we find in\nthe ground and start to link the symbolic thoughts of these individuals to where, when and\nhow they were living.’\nHundreds of caves have been discovered across Europe with elaborate prehistoric\npaintings and carvings on their walls. It is thought the designs, which often depict scenes of\nanimals, were created up to 40,000 years ago – some time after humans began moving\nfrom southern Europe into northern Europe during the last ice age.\nTraditional dating techniques have relied on carbon dating the charcoal and other pigment\nused in the paintings, but this can be inaccurate as it only gives the date the charcoal was\ncreated not when the work was crafted.’When you go into these caves today there is still\ncharcoal lying on the ground, so the artists at the time could have been using old charcoal\nrather than making it fresh themselves,’ explained Dr Pike.\n‘If this was the case, then the date for the painting would be very wrong. Taking samples\nfor carbon dating also means destroying a bit of these precious paintings because you\nneed to take away a bit of the pigment. For carvings, it is virtually impossible to date them\nas there is no organic pigment containing carbon at ail.’\nThe scientists have used their technique to date a series of famous Palaeolithic paintings in\nAltamira cave, northern Spain. Known as the ‘Sistine Chapel of the Palaeolithic’, the\nelaborate works were thought to date from around 14,000 years ago. But in research\npublished by the Natural Environment Research Council’s new website Planet Earth, Dr\nPike discovered some of the paintings were between 25,000 and 35,000 years old. The\nyoungest paintings in the cave were 11,000 years old. Dr Pike said:’We have found that\nmost of these caves were not painted in one go, but the painting spanned up to 20,000\nyears.This goes against what the archaeologists who excavated in the caves found. It is\nprobably the case that people did not live in the caves they painted. It seems the caves\n \n1\n\nthey lived in were elsewhere and there was something special about the painted caves.’\nDr Pike and his team were able to date the paintings using a technique known as uranium\nseries dating, which was originally developed by geologists to date rock formations such as\nstalactites and stalagmites in caves. As water seeps through a cave, it carries extremely\nlow levels of dissolved radioactive uranium along with the mineral calcium carbonate. Over\ntime small amounts of calcium carbonate are deposited to form a hard layer over the\npaintings and this layer also traps the uranium. Due to its radioactive properties, the\nuranium slowly decays to become another element known as thorium. By comparing the\nratio of uranium to thorium in the thin layers on top of the cave art, the researchers were\nable to calculate the age of the paintings.\nThe researchers have also applied their technique to engravings found in rocks around\nCreswell Crags in Derbyshire, which are Britain’s only examples of ice age cave art. They\nproved the engravings were made at least 12,000 years ago. Professor Pablo Arias, an\nexpert on Palaeolithic cave art at the University of Cantabria, Spain, said: ‘Until about ten\nyears ago it was only possible to date cave art by using the style of the figures, but this new\ntechnique developed by Bristol University allows that date to be accurately bracketed. We\nwant to study how the people of the time behaved and how they felt and Palaeolithic art\ngives us a way of looking at the type of symbols that were important to them, so we need to\nknow when the people who were making the art actually lived.’\n \n2",
