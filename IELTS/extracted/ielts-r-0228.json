  "passage_text": "Reading Practice\n \nInspired by Mimicking Mother Nature\n{A} Researchers and designers around the globe endeavor to create new technologies\nthat, by honoring the tenets of life, are both highly efficient and often environmentally\nfriendly. And while biomimicry is not a new concept (Leonardo da Vinci looked to nature to\ndesign his flying machines, for example, and pharmaceutical companies have long been\nmiming plant organisms in synthetic drugs), there is a greater need for products and\nmanufacturing processes that use a minimum of energy, materials, and toxins. What’s\nmore, due to technological advancements and a newfound spirit of innovation among\ndesigners, there are now myriad ways to mimic Mother Nature’s best assets.\n{B} “We have a perfect storm happening right now,” says Jay Harman, an inventor and\nCEO of PAX Scientific, which designs fans, mixers, and pumps to achieve maximum\nefficiency by imitating the natural flow of fluids. “Shapes in nature are extremely simple\nonce you understand them, but to understand what geometries are at play, and to adapt\nthem, is a very complex process. We only just recently have had the computer power and\nmanufacturing capability to produce these types of shapes.” “If we could capture nature’s\nefficiencies across the board, we could decrease dependency on fuel by at least 50\npercent,” Harman says. “What we’re finding already with the tools and methodology we\nhave right now is that we can reduce energy consumption by between 30 and 40 percent.” \n{C} It’s only recently that mainstream companies have begun to equate biomimicry with the\nbottom line. DaimlerChrysler, for example, introduced a prototype car modeled on a coral\nreef fish. Despite its boxy, cube-shaped body, which defies a long-held aerodynamic\nstandard in automotive design (the raindrop shape), the streamlined boxfish proved to be\naerodynamically ideal and the unique construction of its skin—numerous hexagonal, bony\nplates—a perfect recipe for designing a car of maximum strength with minimal weight.\n{D} Companies and communities are flocking to Janine Benyus, author of the landmark\nbook Biomimicry: Innovation Inspired by Nature (Perennial, 2002) and cofounder of the\nBiomimicry Guild, which seats biologists at the table with researchers and designers at\ncompanies such as Nike, Interface carpets, Novell, and Procter & Gamble. Their objective\nis to marry industrial problems with natural solutions.\n{E} Benyus, who hopes companies will ultimately transcend mere product design to\nembrace nature on a more holistic level, breaks biomimicry into three tiers. On a basic\n(albeit complicated) level, industry will mimic nature’s precise and efficient shapes,\nstructures, and geometries. The microstructure of the lotus leaf, for example, causes\nraindrops to bead and run off immediately, while self-cleaning and drying its surface—a\ndiscovery that the British paint company Sto has exploited in a line of building paints. The\nlayered structure of a butterfly wing or a peacock plume, which creates iridescent color by\nrefracting light, is being mimicked by cosmetics giant L’Oreal in a soon-to-be-released line\nof eye shadow, lipstick, and nail varnish.\n{F} The next level of biomimicry involves imitating natural processes and biochemical\n“recipes”: Engineers and scientists are now looking at the nasal glands of seabirds to solve\nthe problem of desalination; the abalone’s ability to self-assemble its incredibly durable\nshell in water, using local ingredients, has inspired an alternative to the conventional, and\noften toxic, “heat, beat, and treat” manufacturing method. How other organisms deal with\nharmful bacteria can also be instructive: Researchers for the Australian company Biosignal,\n \n1\n\nfor instance, observed a seaweed that lives in an environment teeming with microbes to\nfigure out how it kept free of the same sorts of bacterial colonies, called biofilms, that cause\nplaque on your teeth and clog up your bathroom drain. They determined that the seaweed\nuses natural chemicals, called furanones, that jam the cell-to-cell signaling systems that\nallow bacteria to communicate and gather.\n{G} Ultimately, the most sophisticated application of biomimicry, according to Benyus, is\nwhen a company starts seeing itself as an organism in an economic ecosystem that must\nmake thrifty use of limited resources and creates symbiotic relationships with other\norganisms. A boardroom approach at this level begins with imagining any given company,\nor collection of industries, as a forest, prairie, or coral reef, with its own “food\nweb”(manufacturing inputs and outputs) and asking whether waste products from one\nmanufacturing process can be used, or perhaps sold, as an ingredient for another industrial\nactivity. For instance, Geoffrey Coates, a chemist at Cornell, has developed a\nbiodegradable plastic synthesized from carbon dioxide and limonene (a major component\nin the oil extracted from citrus rind) and is working with a cement factory to trap their waste\nCO2 and use it as an ingredient.\n{H} Zero Emissions Research and Initiatives (ZERI), a global network of scientists,\nentrepreneurs, and educators, has initiated eco industrial projects that attempt to find ways\nto reuse all wastes as raw materials for other processes. Storm Brewing in Newfoundland,\nCanada—in one of a growing number of projects around the world applying ZERI\nprinciples—is using spent grains, a by-product of the beer-making process, to make bread\nand grow mushrooms.\nAs industries continue to adopt nature’s models, entire manufacturing processes could\noperate locally, with local ingredients like the factories that use liquefied beach sand to\nmake windshields. As more scientists and engineers begin to embrace biomimicry, natural\norganisms will come to be regarded as mentors, their processes deemed masterful.\n \n2",
