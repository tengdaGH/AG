  "passage_text": "Reading Practice\n \nTrends in the Indian fashion and textile industries\n \n \n \n \nDuring the 1950s, the Indian fashion scene was exciting, stylish and very graceful. There\nwere no celebrity designers or models, nor were there any labels that were widely\nrecognised. The value of a garment was judged by its style and fabric rather than by who\nmade it. It was regarded as perfectly acceptable, even for high-society women, to approach\nan unknown tailor who could make a garment for a few rupees, providing the perfect fit,\nfinish and style. They were proud of getting a bargain, and of giving their own name to the\nend result.\nThe 1960s was an era full of mischievousness and celebration in the arts, music and\ncinema. The period was characterised by freedom from restrictions and, in the fashion\nworld, an acceptance of innovative types of material such as plastic and coated polyester.\nTight-fitting kurtas[1] and churidars[2] and high coiffures were a trend among women.\n \n \nThe following decade witnessed an increase in the export of traditional materials, and the\narrival in India of international fashion. Synthetics became trendy, and the disco culture\naffected the fashion scene.\nIt was in the early 80s when the first fashion store ‘Ravissant’ opened in Mumbai. At that\ntime garments were retailed for a four-figure price tag. American designers like Calvin Klein\nbecame popular. In India too, contours became more masculine, and even the salwar\nkameez[3] was designed with shoulder pads.\nWith the evolution of designer stores came the culture of designer fashion, along with its\nhefty price tags. Whatever a garment was like, consumers were convinced that a higher\nprice tag signified elegant designer fashion, so garments were sold at unbelievable prices.\nMeanwhile, designers decided to get themselves noticed by making showy outfits and\nassociating with the right celebrities. Soon, fashion shows became competitive, each\ndesigner attempting to out-do the other in theme, guest list and media coverage.\n \nIn the last decade of the millennium, the market shrank and ethnic wear made a comeback.\nDuring the recession, there was a push to sell at any cost. With fierce competition the\ninevitable occurred: the once hefty price tags began their downward journey, and the\nfashion-show industry followed suit. However, the liveliness of the Indian fashion scene had\nnot ended - it had merely reached a stable level.\n \nAt the beginning of the 21st century, with new designers and models, and more sensible\ndesigns, the fashion industry accelerated once again. As far as the global fashion industry\nis concerned, Indian ethnic designs and materials are currently in demand from fashion\nhouses and garment manufacturers. India is the third largest producer of cotton, the\nsecond largest producer of silk, and the fifth largest producer of man-made fibres in the\nworld.\nThe Indian garment and fabric industries have many fundamental advantages, in terms of a\ncheaper, skilled work force, cost-effective production, raw materials, flexibility, and a wide\nrange of designs with sequins, beadwork, and embroidery. In addition, that India provides\ngarments to international fashion houses at competitive prices, with a shorter lead time,\nand an effective monopoly on certain designs, is accepted the whole world over. India has\nalways been regarded as the default source in the embroidered garments segment, but\n \n1\n\n \n \nchanges in the rate of exchange between the rupee and the dollar has further depressed\nprices, thereby attracting more buyers. So the international fashion houses walk away with\ncustomised goods, and craftwork is sold at very low rates.\n \n \nAs far as the fabric market is concerned, the range available in India can attract as well as\nconfuse the buyer. Much of the production takes place in the small town of Chapa in the\neastern state of Bihar, a name one might never have heard of. Here fabric-making is a\nfamily industry; the range and quality of raw silks churned out here belie the crude\nproduction methods and equipment. Surat in Gujarat, is the supplier of an amazing set of\njacquards, moss crepes and georgette sheers - all fabrics in high demand. Another Indian\nfabric design that has been adopted by the fashion industry is the ‘Madras check’, originally\nutilised for the universal lungi, a simple lower-body wrap worn in southern India. This\ndesign has now found its way on to bandannas, blouses, home furnishings and almost\nanything one can think of.\nEthnic Indian designs with batik and hand-embroidered motifs have also become popular\nacross the world. Decorative bead work is another product in demand in the international\nmarket. Beads are used to prepare accessory items like belts and bags, and beadwork is\nnow available for haute couture evening wear too.\n[1] knee-length tunics\n[2] trousers\n[3] trouser suit\n \n2",
