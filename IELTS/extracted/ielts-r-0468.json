  "passage_text": "Reading Practice\n \nThe economic importance of coral reefs\nA lot of people around the world are dependent, or partly dependent, on coral reefs for their\nlivelihoods. They often live adjacent to the reef, and their livelihood revolves around the\ndirect extraction, processing and sale of reef resources such as shell fish and seaweeds. In\naddition, their homes are sheltered by the reef from wave action.\nReef flats and shallow reef lagoons are accessible on foot, without the need for a boat, and\nso allow women, children and the elderly to engage directly in manual harvesting, or ‘reef-\ngleaning’. This is a significant factor distinguishing reef-based fisheries from near-shore\nsea fisheries. Near-shore fisheries are typically the domain of adult males, in particular\nwhere they involve the use of boats, with women and children restricted mainly to shore-\nbased activities. However, in a coral-reef fishery the physical accessibility of the reef opens\nup opportunities for direct participation by women, and consequently increases their\nindependence and the importance of their role in the community. It also provides a place\nfor children to play, and to acquire important skills and knowledge for later in life. For\nexample, in the South West Island of Tobi, in the Pacific Ocean, young boys use simple\nhand lines with a loop and bait at the end to develop the art of fishing on the reef. Similarly,\nin the Surin Islands of Thailand, young Moken boys spend much of their time playing,\nswimming and diving in shallow reef lagoons, and in doing so build crucial skills for their\nfuture daily subsistence.\nSecondary occupations, such as fish processing and marketing activities, are often\ndominated by women, and offer an important survival strategy for households with access\nto few other physical assets (such as boats and gear), for elderly women, widows, or the\nwives of infirm men. On Ulithi Atoll in the western Pacific, women have a distinct role and\nrights in the distribution of fish catches. This is because the canoes, made from mahogany\nlogs from nearby Yap Island, are obtained through the exchange of cloth made by the\nwomen of Ulithi. Small-scale reef fisheries support the involvement of local women traders\nand their involvement can give them greater control over the household income, and in\nnegotiating for loans or credit. Thus their role is not only important in providing income for\ntheir families, it also underpins the economy of the local village.\nPoor people with little access to land, labour and financial resources are particularly reliant\non exploiting natural resources, and consequently they are vulnerable to seasonal changes\nin availability of those resources. The diversity of coral reef fisheries, combined with their\nphysical accessibility and the protection they provide against bad weather, make them\nrelatively stable compared with other fisheries, or land-based agricultural production.\nIn many places, the reef may even act as a resource bank, used as a means of saving food\nfor future times of need. In Manus, Papua New Guinea, giant clams are collected and held\nin walled enclosures on the reef, until they are needed during periods of rough weather. In\nPalau, sea cucumbers are seldom eaten during good weather in an effort to conserve their\npopulations for months during which rough weather prohibits good fishing.\nCoral reef resources also act as a buffer against seasonal lows in other sectors, particularly\nagriculture. For example, in coastal communities in northern Mozambique, reef harvests\nprovide key sources of food and cash when agricultural production is low, with the peak in\nfisheries production coinciding with the period of lowest agricultural stocks. In Papua New\nGuinea, while agriculture is the primary means of food production, a large proportion of the\n \n1\n\ncoastal population engage in sporadic subsistence fishing.\nIn many coral-reef areas, tourism is one of the main industries bringing employment, and in\nmany cases is promoted to provide alternatives to fisheries-based livelihoods, and to\nensure that local reef resources are conserved. In the Caribbean alone, tours based on\nscuba-diving have attracted 20 million people in one year. The upgrading of roads and\ncommunications associated with the expansion of tourism may also bring benefits to local\ncommunities. However, plans for development must be considered carefully. The ability of\nthe poorer members of the community to access the benefits of tourism is far from\nguaranteed, and requires development guided by social, cultural and environmental\nprinciples. There is growing recognition that sustainability is a key requirement, as\nencompassed in small-scale eco-tourism activities, for instance.\nWhere tourism development has not been carefully planned, and the needs and priorities of\nthe local community have not been properly recognised, conflict has sometimes arisen\nbetween tourism and local, small-scale fishers.\n \n2",
