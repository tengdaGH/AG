  "passage_text": "Reading Practice\n \nFather of modern management\nA\nPeter Drucker was one of the most important management thinkers of the past hundred\nyears. He wrote about 40 book and thousands of articles and he never rested in his\nmission to persuade the world that management matters. “Management is an organ of\ninstitutions … the organ that converts a mob into an organisation, and human efforts into\nperformance.” Did he succeed? The range of his influence was extraordinary. Wherever\npeople grapple with tricky management problems, from big organizations to small ones,\nfrom the public sector to the private, and increasingly in the voluntary sector, you can find\nDrucker’s fingerprints.\nB\nHis first two books – The End of Economic Man (1939) and The Future of Industrial\nMan (1942) – had their admirers, including Winston Churchill, but they annoyed academic\ncritics by ranging so widely over so many different subjects. Still, the second of these books\nattracted attention with its passionate insistence that companies had a social dimension as\nwell as an economic purpose. His third book, The Concept of the Corporation, became an\ninstant bestseller and has remained in print ever since.\nC\nThe two most interesting arguments in The Concept of the Corporation actually had little to\ndo with the decentralization fad. They were to dominate his work. The first had to do with\n“empowering” workers. Drucker believed in treating workers as resources rather than just\nas costs. He was a harsh critic of the assembly-line system of production that then\ndominated the manufacturing sector – partly because assembly lines moved at the speed\nof the slowest and partly because they failed to engage the creativity of individual workers.\nThe second argument had to do with the rise of knowledge workers. Drucker argued that\nthe world is moving from an “economy of goods” to an economy of “knowledge” – and from\na society dominated by an industrial proletariat to one dominated by brain workers. He\ninsisted that this had profound implications for both managers and politicians. Managers\nhad to stop treating workers like cogs in a huge inhuman machine and start treating them\nas brain workers. In turn, politicians had to realise that knowledge, and hence education,\nwas the single most important resource for any advanced society. Yet Drucker also thought\nthat this economy had implications for knowledge workers themselves. They had to come\nto terms with the fact that they were neither “bosses” nor “workers”, but something in\nbetween: entrepreneurs who had responsibility for developing their most important\nresource, brainpower, and who also needed to take more control of their own careers,\nincluding their pension plans.\nD\nHowever, there was also a hard side to his work. Drucker was responsible for inventing one\nof the rational school of management’s most successful products – “management by\nobjectives”. In one of his most substantial works, The Practice of Management (1954), he\nemphasised the importance of managers and corporations setting clear long-term\nobjectives and then translating those long-term objectives into more immediate goals. He\n \n1\n\nargued that firms should have an elite corps of general managers, who set these long-term\nobjectives, and then a group of more specialised managers. For his critics, this was a\nretreat from his earlier emphasis on the soft side of management. For Drucker it was all\nperfectly consistent: if you rely too much on empowerment you risk anarchy, whereas if you\nrely too much on command-and-control you sacrifice creativity. The trick is for managers to\nset long-term goals, but then allow their employees to work out ways of achieving those\ngoals. If Drucker helped make management a global industry, he also helped push it\nbeyond its business base. He was emphatically a management thinker, not just a business\none. He believed that management is “the defining organ of all modern institutions”, not just\ncorporations.\nE\nThere are three persistent criticisms of Drucker’s work. The first is that he focused on big\norganisations rather than small ones. The Concept of the Corporation was in many ways a\nfanfare to big organisations. As Drucker said, “We know today that in modern industrial\nproduction, particularly in modern mass production, the small unit is not only inefficient, it\ncannot produce at all.” The book helped to launch the “big organisation boom” that\ndominated business thinking for the next 20 years. The second criticism is that Drucker’s\nenthusiasm for management by objectives helped to lead the business down a dead end.\nThey prefer to allow ideas, including ideas for long-term strategies, to bubble up from the\nbottom and middle of the organisations rather than being imposed from on high. Thirdly,\nDrucker is criticised for being a maverick who has increasingly been left behind by the\nincreasing rigour of his chosen field. There is no single area of academic management\ntheory that he made his own.\nF\nThere is some truth in the first two arguments. Drucker never wrote anything as good\nas The Concept of the Corporation on entrepreneurial start-ups. Drucker’s work on\nmanagement by objectives sits uneasily with his earlier and later writings on the importance\nof knowledge workers and self-directed teams. But the third argument is short-sighted and\nunfair because it ignores Drucker’s pioneering role in creating the modern profession of\nmanagement. He produced one of the first systematic studies of a big company. He\npioneered the idea that ideas can help galvanise companies. The biggest problem with\nevaluating Drucker’s influence is that so many of his ideas have passed into conventional\nwisdom. In other words, he is the victim of his own success. His writings on the importance\nof knowledge workers and empowerment may sound a little banal today. But they certainly\nweren’t banal when he first dreamed them up in the 1940s, or when they were first put in to\npractice in the Anglo-Saxon world in the 1980s. Moreover, Drucker continued to produce\nnew ideas up until his 90s. His work on the management of voluntary organisations\nremained at the cutting edge.\n \n2",
