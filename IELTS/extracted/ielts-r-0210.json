  "passage_text": "Reading Practice\n \nHow the mind ages\nThe way mental function changes is largely determined by three factors-mental lifestyle,\nthe impact of chronic disease and flexibility of the mind.\nExperiments have shown that younger monkeys consistently outperform their older\ncolleagues on memory tests. Formerly, psychologists concluded that memory and other\nmental functions in humans deteriorate over time because of changes in the brain. Thus\nmental decline after young adulthood appeared inevitable. The truth, however, is not quite\nso simple.\nStanley Rapoport at the National Institute of Health in the United States measured the flow\nof blood in the brains of old and young people as they completed different tasks. Since\nblood flow reflects neural activity. Rapoport could compare which networks of neurons\nwere the same, the neural networks they used were significantly different. The older\nsubjects used different internal strategies to accomplish comparable results at the same\ntime,'Rapoport says. At the Georgia Institute of Technology, psychologist Timothy\nSalthouse compared a group of fast and accurate typists of college age with another group\nin their 60s. Both groups typed 60 words a minute. The older typists, it turned out, achieved\ntheir speed with cunning little strategies that made them more efficient than their younger\ncounterparts. They made fewer finger shifts, gaining a fraction of a second here and there.\nThey also read ahead in the test. The neural networks involved in typing appear to have\nbeen reshaped to compensate for losses in motor skills or other age changes.\nIn fact, there's evidence that deterioration in mental functions can actually be reversed.\nNeuropsychologist Marion Diamond at the University of California has shown that mental\nactivity maks neurons sprout new dendrites* which establish connections with other\nneurons. The dendrites shrink when the mind is idle. For example,'when a rat is kept in\nisolation, the animal's brain shrinks, but if we put that rat with other rats in a large cage and\ngive them an assortment of toys, we can show, after four days, significant differences in its\nbrain.'says Diamond. After a month in the enriched surroundings, the whole cerebral cortex\nhas expanded, as has its blood supply.'But even in the enriched surroundings, rats get\nbored unless the toys are varied. Animals are just like we are. They need stimulation,'says\nDiamond. A busy mental lifestyle keeps the human mind fit, says Warner Schaie of Penn\nState University. ‘People who regularly participate in challenging tasks retain their\nintellectual abilities better than mental couch potatoes.'\nIn his studies, Schaie detected a decline in mental function among individuals who\nunderwent lengthy stays in hospital for chronic illness. He postulated it might be due to the\nmental passivity encouraged by hospital routine.\nOne of the most profoundly important mental functions is memory. Memory exists in more\nthan one form, what we call knowledge- facts- is what psychologists such as Harry Bahrick\nof Ohio Wesleyan University call semantic memory. Events, conversations and\noccurrences in time and space, on the other hand, make up episodic memory. It's true that\nepisodic memory begins to decline when most people are in their 50s, but it's never perfect\nat any age.\nProbing the longevity of knowledge, Bahrick tested 1,000 high school graduates to see how\nwell they remembered the school subject algebra. Some had completed the course a\n \n1\n\nmonth before, other 50 years earlier. Surprisingly, he found that a person's grasp of\nalgebra did not depend on how long ago he'd taken the course. The determining factor was\nthe duration of instruction. Those who had spent only a few months learning algebra forgot\nmost of it within two or three years while others who had been instructed for longer\nremembered better. According to Bahrick,'the long-term residue of knowledge remains\nstable over the decades, independent of the age of the person and the memory.'\nPerhaps even more important than the ability to remember is the ability to manage\nmemory- a mental function known as metamemory.'You could say metamemory is a\nbyproduct of going to school,'says psychologist Robert Kail of Purdue University,'The\nquestion-and-answer process,especially exam taking, helps children learn and teaches\nthem how their memory functions.This may be one reason why the better educated a\nperson is, the more likely they are to perform well in many aspects of life and in\npsychological assessments: A group of adult novice chess players were compared with a\ngroup of child experts at the game. But when asked to remember the patterns of chess\npieces arranged on a board, the children won.' Because they'd played a lot of chess, their\nknowledge of chess was better organized than that of the adults, and their existing\nknowledge of chess served as a framework for new memory,'explains Kail. Cognitive style,\nanother factor in maintaining mental function, is what Schaie calls the ability to adapt and\nroll with life's punches.'He measured mental flexibility with questions and tests requiring\npeople to carry out in an offbeat way an everyday activity they had done millions of times.\nOne example was asking people to copy a paragraph substituting uppercase letters for\nlowercase ones. These tests seem silly, but flexible-minded people manage to complete\nthem,'says Schaie. The rigid person responds with tension instead and performs poorly.\nThose who score highly on tests of cognition at an advanced age are those who tested\nhigh in mental flexibility at middle age'.\nOn a more optimistic note, one mental resource that only improves with time is specialized\nknowledge. Crystallised intelligence about one's occupation apparently does not decline at\nall until at least age 75. Vocabulary is another such specialized form of knowledge.\nResearch clearly shows that vocabulary develops with time. Retired teachers and\njournalists consistently score higher on tests of vocabulary and general information than\ncollege students.\n \n2",
