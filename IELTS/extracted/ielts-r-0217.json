  "passage_text": "Reading Practice\nHuman remain in Green Sahara\n{A} On October 13,2,000, a small team of paleontologists led by Paul Sereno of the\nUniversity of Chicago clambered out of three battered Land Rovers, filled their water\nbottles, and scattered on foot across the toffee-colored sands of the Tenere desert in\nnorthern Niger. The Tenere , on the southern flank of the Sahara, easily ranks among the\nmost desolate landscapes on Earth. The Tuareg , turbaned nomads who for centuries have\nruled this barren realm, refer to it as a “desert within a desert”-a California-size ocean of\nsand and rock, where a single massive dune might stretch a hundred miles, and the\ncombination of 120-degree heat and inexorable winds can wick the water from a human\nbody in less than a day. The harsh conditions, combined with intermittent conflict between\nthe Tuareg and the Niger government, have kept the region largely unexplored. \n{B} Mike Hettwer, a photographer accompanying the team, headed off by himself toward a\ntrio of small dunes. He crested the first slope and stared in amazement. The dunes were\nspilling over with bones. He took a few shots with his digital camera and hurried back to the\nLand Rovers. “I found some bones:’ Hettwer said, when the team had regrouped. “But\nthey’re not dinosaurs. They’re human.” \n{C} In the spring of 2005 Sereno contacted Elena Garcea, an archaeologist at the\nUniversity of Cassino, in Italy, inviting her to accompany him on a return to the site. Garcea\nhad spent three decades working digs along the Nile in Sudan and in the mountains of the\nLibyan Desert, and was well acquainted with the ancient peoples of the Sahara. But she\nhad never heard of Paul Sereno. His claim to have found so many skeletons in one place\nseemed far fetched, given that no other Neolithic cemetery contained more than a dozen or\nso. Some archaeologists would later be skeptical; one sniped that he was just a\n“moonlighting paleontologist.” But Garcea was too intrigued to dismiss him as an interloper.\nShe agreed to join him.\n{D} Garcea explained that the Kiffian were a fishing-based culture and lived during the\nearliest wet period, between 8,000 and 10,000 years ago. She held a Kiffian sherd next to\na Tenerian one. “What is so amazing is that the people who made these two pots lived\nmore than a thousand years apart.”\n{E} Over the next three weeks, Sereno and Garcea-along with five American excavators,\nfive Tuareg guides, and five soldiers from Nigeria’s army, sent to protect the camp from\nbandits—made a detailed map of the site, which they dubbed Gobero, after the Tuareg\nname for the area. They exhumed eight burials and collected scores of artifacts from both\ncultures. In a dry lake bed adjacent to the dunes, they found dozens of fishhooks and\nharpoons carved from animal bone Apparently the Kiffian fishermen weren’t just going after\nsmall fry: Scattered near the dunes were the remains of Nile perch, a beast of a fish that\ncan weigh nearly 300 pounds, as well as crocodile and hippo bones.\n{F} Sereno flew home with the most important skeletons and artifacts and immediately\nbegan planning for the next field season. In the meantime, he carefully removed one tooth\nfrom each of four skulls and sent them to a lab for radiocarbon dating. The results pegged\nthe age of the tightly bundled burials at roughly 9,000 years old, the heart of the Kiffian era.\nThe smaller “sleeping” skeletons turned out to be about 6,000 years old, well within the\nTenerian period. At least now the scientists knew who was who.\n \n1\n\n{G} In the fall of 2006 they returned to Gobero, accompanied by a larger dig crew and six\nadditional scientists. Garcea hoped to excavate some 80 burials, and the team began\ndigging. As the skeletons began to emerge from the dunes, each presented a fresh riddle,\nespecially the Tenerian. A male skeleton had been buried with a finger in his mouth.\n{H} Even at the site, Arizona State University bio archaeologist Chris Stojanowski could\nbegin to piece together some clues. Judging by the bones, the Kiffian appeared to be a\npeaceful, hard working people. “The lack of head and forearm injuries suggests they\nweren’t doing much fighting,” he told me. “And these guys were strong.” He pointed to a\nlong, narrow ridge running along a femur. “That’s the muscle attachment,” he said. “This\nindividual had huge leg muscles, which means he was eating a lot of protein and had a\nstrenuous lifestyle — both consistent with a fishing way of life.” For contrast, he showed me\nthe femur of a Tenerian male. The ridge was barely perceptible. “This guy had a much less\nstrenuous lifestyle,” he said, “which you might expect of a herder.”\n{I} Stojanowski’s assessment that the Tenerian were herders fits the prevailing view among\nscholars of life in the Sahara 6,000 years ago, when drier conditions favored herding over\nhunting. But if the Tenerian were herders, Sereno pointed out, where were the herds?\nAmong the hundreds of animal bones that had turned up at the site, none belonged to\ngoats or sheep, and only three came from a cow species. “It’s not unusual for a herding\nculture not to slaughter their cattle, particularly in a cemetery, M Garcea responded, noting\nthat even modern pastoralists, such as Niger’s Wodaabe, are loath to butcher even one\nanimal in their herd. Perhaps, Sereno reasoned, the Tenerian at Gobero were a transitional\ngroup that had not fully adopted herding and still relied heavily on hunting and fishing.\n{J} Back in Arizona, Stojanowski continues to analyze the Gobero bones for clues to the\nGreen Saharans’ health and diet. Other scientists are trying to derive DNA from the teeth,\nwhich could reveal the genetic origins of the Kiffian and Tenerian- and possibly link them to\ndescendants living today. Sereno and Garcea estimate a hundred burials remain to be\nexcavated. But as the harsh Tenere winds continue to erode the dunes, time is running out.\n“Every archaeological site has a life cycle,” Garcea said. “It begins when people begin to\nuse the place, followed by disuse, then nature takes over, and finally it is gone. Gobero is\nat the end of its life.”\n \n2",
