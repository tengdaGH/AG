  "passage_text": "Reading Practice\n \nMemory Decoding\nTry this memory test: Study each face and compose a vivid image for the person’s first and\nlast name. Rose Leo, for example, could be a rosebud and a lion. Fill in the blanks on the\nnext page. The Examinations School at Oxford University is an austere building of oak-\npaneled rooms, large Gothic windows, and looming portraits of eminent dukes and earls. It\nis where generations of Oxford students have tested their memory on final exams, and it is\nwhere, last August, 34 contestants gathered at the World Memory Championships to be\nexamined in an entirely different manner.\nA\nIn timed trials, contestants were challenged to look at and then recite a two-page poem,\nmemorize rows of 40-digit numbers, recall the names of 110 people after looking at their\nphotographs, and perform seven other feats of extraordinary retention. Some tests took just\na few minutes; others lasted hours. In the 14 years since the World Memory\nChampionships was founded, no one has memorized the order of a shuffled deck of\nplaying cards in less than 30 seconds. That nice round number has become the four-\nminute mile of competitive memory, a benchmark that the world’s best “mental athletes,” as\nsome of them like to be called, is closing in on. Most contestants claim to have just average\nmemories, and scientific testing confirms that they’re not just being modest. Their feats are\nbased on tricks that capitalize on how the human brain encodes information. Anyone can\nlearn them.\nB\nPsychologists Elizabeth Valentine and John Wilding, authors of the monograph Superior\nMemory, recently teamed up with Eleanor Maguire, a neuroscientist at University College\nLondon to study eight people, including Karsten, who had finished near the top of the World\nMemory Championships. They wondered if the contestants’ brains were different in some\nway. The researchers put the competitors and a group of control subjects into an MRI\nmachine and asked them to perform several different memory tests while their brains were\nbeing scanned. When it came to memorizing sequences of three-digit numbers, the\ndifference between the memory contestant and the control subjects was, as expected,\nimmense. However, when they were shown photographs of magnified snowflakes, images\nthat the competitors had never tried to memorize before, the champions did no better than\nthe control group. When the researchers analyzed the brain scans, they found that the\nmemory champs were activating some brain regions that were different from those the\ncontrol subjects were using. These regions, which included the right posterior\nhippocampus, are known to be involved in visual memory and spatial navigation.\nC\nIt might seem odd that the memory contestants would use visual imagery and spatial\nnavigation to remember numbers, but the activity makes sense when their techniques are\nrevealed. Cooke, a 23-year-old cognitive-science graduate student with a shoulder-length\nmop of curly hair, is a grand master of brain storage. He can memorize the order of 10\ndecks of playing cards in less than an hour or one deck of cards in less than a minute. He\nis closing in on the 30-second deck. In the Lamb and Flag, Cooke pulled out a deck of\ncards and shuffled it. He held up three cards – the 7 of spades, the queen of clubs, and the\n \n1\n\n10 of spades. He pointed at a fireplace and said, “Destiny’s Child is whacking Franz\nSchubert with handbags.” The next three cards were the king of hearts, the king of spades,\nand the jack of clubs.\nD\nHow did he do it? Cooke has already memorized a specific person, verb, and object that he\nassociates with each card in the deck. For example, for the 7 of spades, the person (or, in\nthis case, persons) is always the singing group Destiny’s Child, the action is surviving a\nstorm, and the image is a dinghy. The queen of clubs is always his friend Henrietta, the\naction is thwacking with a handbag, and the image is of wardrobes filled with designer\nclothes. When Cooke commits a deck to memory, he does it three cards at a time. Every\nthree-card group forms a single image of a person doing something to an object. The first\ncard in the triplet becomes the person, the second the verb, the third the object. He then\nplaces those images along a specific familiar route, such as the one he took through the\nLamb and Flag. In competitions, he uses an imaginary route that he has designed to be as\nsmooth and downhill as possible. When it comes time to recall, Cooke takes a mental walk\nalong his route and translates the images into cards. That’s why the MRIs of the memory\ncontestants showed activation in the brain areas associated with visual imagery and spatial\nnavigation.\nE\nThe more resonant the images are, the more difficult they are to forget. But even\nmeaningful information is hard to remember when there’s a lot of it. That’s why competitive\nmemorizers place their images along an imaginary route. That technique, known as the loci\nmethod, reportedly originated in 477 B.C. with the Greek poet Simonides of Ceos.\nSimonides was the sole survivor of a roof collapse that killed all the other guests at a royal\nbanquet. The bodies were mangled beyond recognition, but Simonides was able to\nreconstruct the guest list by closing his eyes and recalling each individual around the\ndinner table. What he had discovered was that our brains are exceptionally good at\nremembering images and spatial information. Evolutionary psychologists have offered an\nexplanation: Presumably, our ancestors found it important to recall where they found their\nlast meal or the way back to the cave. After Simonides’ discovery, the loci method became\npopular across ancient Greece as a trick for memorizing speeches and texts. Aristotle\nwrote about it, and later a number of treatises on the art of memory were published in\nRome. Before printed books, the art of memory was considered a staple of classical\neducation, on a par with grammar, logic, and rhetoric.\nF\nThe most famous of the naturals was the Russian journalist S.V. Shereshevski, who could\nrecall long lists of numbers memorized decades earlier, as well as poems, strings of\nnonsense syllables, and just about anything else he was asked to remember. “The capacity\nof his memory had no distinct limits,” wrote Alexander Luria, the Russian psychologist who\nstudies Shereshevski also had synesthesia, a rare condition in which the senses become\nintertwined. For example, every number may be associated with a color or every word with\na taste. Synesthetic reactions evoke a response in more areas of the brain, making\nmemory easier.\nG\n \n2\n\nK. Anders Ericsson, a Swedish-born psychologist at Florida State University, thinks anyone\ncan acquire Shereshevski’s skills. He cites an experiment with S. F., an undergraduate who\nwas paid to take a standard test of memory called the digit span for one hour a day, two or\nthree days a week. When he started, he could hold, like most people, only about seven\ndigits in his head at any given time (conveniently, the length of a phone number). Over two\nyears, S. F. completed 250 hours of testing. By then, he had stretched his digit span from 7\nto more than 80. The study of S. F. led Ericsson to believe that innately superior memory\ndoesn’t exist at all. When he reviewed original case studies of naturals, he found that\nexceptional memorizers were using techniques – sometimes without realizing it – and lots\nof practice. Often, exceptional memory was only for a single type of material, like digits. “If\nwe look at some of these memory tasks, they’re the kind of thing most people don’t even\nwaste one hour practicing, but if they wasted 50 hours, they’d be exceptional at it,”\nEricsson says. It would be remarkable, he adds, to find a “person who is exceptional across\na number of tasks. I don’t think that there’s any compelling evidence that there are such\npeople.”\n \n3",
