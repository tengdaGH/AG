  "passage_text": "Reading Practice\nAir traffic control in the USA\nA\nAn accident that occurred in the skies over the Grand Canyon in 1956 resulted in the\nestablishment of the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) to regulate and oversee the\noperation of aircraft in the skies over the United States, which were becoming quite\ncongested. The resulting structure of air traffic control has greatly increased the safety of\nflight in the United States, and similar air traffic control procedures are also in place over\nmuch of the rest of the world.\nB\nRudimentary air traffic control (ATC) existed well before the Grand Canyon disaster. As\nearly as the 1920s, the earliest air traffic controllers manually guided aircraft in the vicinity\nof the airports, using lights and flags, while beacons and flashing lights were placed along\ncross-country routes to establish the earliest airways. However, this purely visual system\nwas useless in bad weather, and, by the 1930s, radio communication was coming into use\nfor ATC. The first region to have something approximating today’s ATC was New York City,\nwith other major metropolitan areas following soon after.\nC\nIn the 1940s, ATC centres could and did take advantage of the newly developed radar and\nimproved radio communication brought about by the Second World War, but the system\nremained rudimentary. It was only after the creation of the FAA that full-scale regulation of\nAmerica’s airspace took place, and this was fortuitous, for the advent of the jet engine\nsuddenly resulted in a large number of very fast planes, reducing pilots’ margin of error and\npractically demanding some set of rules to keep everyone well separated and operating\nsafely in the air.\nD\nMany people think that ATC consists of a row of controllers sitting in front of their radar\nscreens at the nation’s airports, telling arriving and departing traffic what to do. This is a\nvery incomplete part of the picture. The FAA realised that the airspace over the United\nStates would at any time have many different kinds of planes, flying for many different\npurposes, in a variety of weather conditions, and the same kind of structure was needed to\naccommodate all of them.\nE\nTo meet this challenge, the following elements were put into effect. First, ATC extends over\nvirtually the entire United States. In general, from 365m above the ground and higher, the\nentire country is blanketed by controlled airspace. In certain areas, mainly near airports,\ncontrolled airspace extends down to 215m above the ground, and, in the immediate vicinity\nof an airport, all the way down to the surface. Controlled airspace is that airspace in which\nFAA regulations apply. Elsewhere, in uncontrolled airspace, pilots are bound by fewer\nregulations. In this way, the recreational pilot who simply wishes to go flying for a while\nwithout all the restrictions imposed by the FAA has only to stay in uncontrolled airspace,\nbelow 365m, while the pilot who does want the protection afforded by ATC can easily enter\n \n1\n\nthe controlled airspace.\nF\nThe FAA then recognised two types of operating environments. In good meteorological\nconditions, flying would be permitted under Visual Flight Rules (VFR), which suggests a\nstrong reliance on visual cues to maintain an acceptable level of safety. Poor visibility\nnecessitated a set of Instrumental Flight Rules (IFR), under which the pilot relied on altitude\nand navigational information provided by the plane’s instrument panel to fly safely. On a\nclear day, a pilot in controlled airspace can choose a VFR or IFR flight plan, and the FAA\nregulations were devised in a way which accommodates both VFR and IFR operations in\nthe same airspace. However, a pilot can only choose to fly IFR if they possess an\ninstrument rating which is above and beyond the basic pilot’s license that must also be\nheld.\nG\nControlled airspace is divided into several different types, designated by letters of the\nalphabet. Uncontrolled airspace is designated Class F, while controlled airspace below\n5,490m above sea level and not in the vicinity of an airport is Class E. All airspace above\n5,490m is designated Class A. The reason for the division of Class E and Class A airspace\nstems from the type of planes operating in them. Generally, Class E airspace is where one\nfinds general aviation aircraft (few of which can climb above 5,490m anyway), and\ncommercial turboprop aircraft. Above 5,490m is the realm of the heavy jets, since jet\nengines operate more efficiently at higher altitudes. The difference between Class E and A\nairspace is that in Class A, all operations are IFR, and pilots must be instrument-rated, that\nis, skilled and licensed in aircraft instrumentation. This is because ATC control of the\nentire space is essential. Three other types of airspace, Classes D, C and B, govern\nthe vicinity of airports. These correspond roughly to small municipal, medium-\nsized metropolitan and major metropolitan airports respectively, and encompass\nan increasingly rigorous set of regulations. For example, all a VFR pilot has to do to enter\nClass C airspace is establish two-way radio contact with ATC. No explicit permission from\nATC to enter is needed, although the pilot must continue to obey all regulations governing\nVFR flight. To enter Class B airspace, such as on approach to a major metropolitan airport,\nan explicit ATC clearance is required. The private pilot who cruises without permission into\nthis airspace risks losing their license.\n \n2",
