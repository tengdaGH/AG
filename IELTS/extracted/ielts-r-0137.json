  "passage_text": "Reading Practice\n \nDoctoring sales\nPharmaceuticals is one of the most profitable industries in North America. But do\nthe drugs industry's sales and marketing strategies go too far?\nA\nA few months ago Kim Schaefer, sales representative of a major global pharmaceutical\ncompany, walked into a medical center in New York to bring information and free samples\nof her company's latest products. That day she was lucky - a doctor was available to see\nher. ‘The last rep offered me a trip to Florida. What do you have?' the physician asked. He\nwas only half joking.\nB\nWhat was on offer that day was a pair of tickets for a New York musical. But on any given\nday, what Schaefer can offer is typical for today’s drugs rep - a car trunk full of promotional\ngifts and gadgets, a budget that could buy lunches and dinners for a small country,\nhundreds of free drug samples and the freedom to give a physician $200 to prescribe her\nnew product to the next six patients who fit the drug's profile. And she also has a few $\n1,000 honoraria to offer in exchange for doctors' attendance at her company's next\neducational lecture.\nC\nSelling pharmaceuticals is a daily exercise in ethical judgement. Salespeople like Schaefer\nwalk the line between the common practice of buying a prospect’s time with a free meal,\nand bribing doctors to prescribe their drugs. They work in an industry highly criticized for its\nsales and marketing practices, but find themselves in the middle of the age-old chlcken-or-\negg question - businesses won’t use strategies that don't work, so are doctors to blame for\nthe escalating extravagance of pharmaceutical marketing? Or is It the industry’s\nresponsibility to decide the boundaries?\nD \nThe explosion in the sheer number of salespeople in the field - and the amount of funding\nused to promote their causes - forces close examination of the pressures, Influences and\nrelationships between drug reps and doctors. Salespeople provide much-needed\ninformation and education to physicians. In many cases the glossy brochures, article\nreprints and prescriptions they deliver are primary sources of drug education for healthcare\ngivers. With the huge investment the industry has placed in face-to-face selling,\nsalespeople have essentially become specialists In one drug or group of drugs - a\ntremendous advantage In getting the attention of busy doctors in need of quick information.\nE\nBut the sales push rarely stops in the office. The flashy brochures and pamphlets left by the\nsales reps are often followed up with meals at expensive restaurants, meetings in warm\nand sunny places, and an inundation of promotional gadgets.

Millions of dollars are spent by\n \n1\n\npharmaceutical companies on promotional products like coffee mugs, shirts, umbrellas,\nand golf balls. Money well spent? It’s hard to tell. ‘I’ve been the recipient of golf balls from\none company and I use them, but it doesn’t make me prescribe their medicine,’ says one\ndoctor.

And patients are the ones who pay - in the form\nof sky-rocketing prescription prices - for every pen that’s handed out, every free theatre\nticket, and every steak dinner eaten. In the end the fact remains that pharmaceutical\ncompanies have every right to make a profit and will continue to find new ways to increase\nsales. But as the medical world continues to grapple with what’s acceptable and what’s not,\nIt is clear that companies must continue to be heavily scrutinized for their sales and\nmarketing strategies.\n \n2",
