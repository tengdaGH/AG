  "passage_text": "Reading Practice\n \nSecond nature\n \n \n \nYour personality isn't necessarily set in stone. With a little experimentation, people can\nreshape their temperaments and inject passion, optimism, joy and courage into their lives\nA Psychologists have long held that a person's character cannot undergo a transformation\nin any meaningful way and that the key traits of personality are determined at a very young\nage. However, researchers have begun looking more closely at ways we can change.\nPositive psychologists have identified 24 qualities we admire, such as loyalty and kindness,\nand are studying them to find out why they come so naturally to some people. What they're\ndiscovering is that many of these qualities amount to habitual behaviour that determines\nthe way we respond to the world. The good news is that all this can be learned.\n \nSome qualities are less challenging to develop than others, optimism being one of them.\nHowever, developing qualities requires mastering a range of skills which are diverse and\nsometimes surprising. For example, to bring more joy and passion into your life, you must\nbe open to experiencing negative emotions. Cultivating such qualities will help you realise\nyour full potential.\n \nB 'The evidence is good that most personality traits can be altered,' says Christopher\nPeterson, professor of psychology at the University of Michigan, who cites himself as an\nexample. Inherently introverted, he realised early on that as an academic, his reticence\nwould prove disastrous in the lecture hall. So he learned to be more outgoing and to\nentertain his classes. 'Now my extroverted behaviour is spontaneous,' he says.\n \nC David Fajgenbaum had to make a similar transition. He was preparing for university,\nwhen he had an accident that put an end to his sports career. On campus, he quickly found\nthat beyond ordinary counselling, the university had no services for students who were\nundergoing physical rehabilitation and suffering from depression like him. He therefore\nlaunched a support group to help others in similar situations. He took action despite his\nown pain - a typical response of an optimist.\n \nD Suzanne Segerstrom, professor of psychology at the University of Kentucky, believes\nthat the key to increasing optimism is through cultivating optimistic behaviour, rather than\npositive thinking. She recommends you train yourself to pay attention to good fortune by\nwriting down three positive things that come about each day. This will help you convince\nyourself that favourable outcomes actually happen all the time, making it easier to begin\ntaking action.\n \nE You can recognise a person who is passionate about a pursuit by the way they are so\nstrongly involved in it. Tanya Streeter's passion is freediving - the sport of plunging deep\ninto the water without tanks or other breathing equipment. Beginning in 1998, she set nine\nworld records and can hold her breath for six minutes. The physical stamina required for\nthis sport is intense but the psychological demands are even more overwhelming. Streeter\nlearned to untangle her fears from her judgment of what her body and mind could do. 'In\nmy career as a competitive freediver, there was a limit to what I could do - but it wasn't\nanywhere near what I thought it was/ she says.\nF Finding a pursuit that excites you can improve anyone's life. The secret about consuming\npassions, though, according to psychologist Paul Silvia of the University of North Carolina,\n \n1\n\n \nis that 'they require discipline, hard work and ability, which is why they are so rewarding.'\nPsychologist Todd Kashdan has this advice for those people taking up a new passion: 'As\na newcomer, you also have to tolerate and laugh at your own ignorance. You must be\nwilling to accept the negative feelings that come your way,' he says.\nG In 2004, physician-scientist Mauro Zappaterra began his PhD research at Harvard\nMedical School. Unfortunately, he was miserable as his research wasn't compatible with\nhis curiosity about healing. He finally took a break and during eight months in Santa Fe,\nZappaterra learned about alternative healing techniques not taught at Harvard. When he\ngot back, he switched labs to study how cerebrospinal fluid nourishes the developing\nnervous system. He also vowed to look for the joy in everything, including failure, as this\ncould help him learn about his research and himself.\n \nOne thing that can hold joy back is a person's concentration on avoiding failure rather than\ntheir looking forward to doing something well. 'Focusing on being safe might get in the way\nof your reaching your goals,' explains Kashdan. For example, are you hoping to get\nthrough a business lunch without embarrassing yourself, or are you thinking about how\nfascinating the conversation might be?\nH Usually, we think of courage in physical terms but ordinary life demands something else.\nFor marketing executive Kenneth Pedeleose, it meant speaking out against something he\nthought was ethically wrong. The new manager was intimidating staff so Pedeleose\ncarefully recorded each instance of bullying and eventually took the evidence to a senior\ndirector, knowing his own job security would be threatened. Eventually the manager was\nthe one to go. According to Cynthia Pury, a psychologist at Clemson University,\nPedeleose's story proves the point that courage is not motivated by fearlessness, but by\nmoral obligation. Pury also believes that people can acquire courage. Many of her students\nsaid that faced with a risky situation, they first tried to calm themselves down, then looked\nfor a way to mitigate the danger, just as Pedeleose did by documenting his allegations.\nOver the long term, picking up a new character trait may help you move toward being the\nperson you want to be. And in the short term, the effort itself could be surprisingly\nrewarding, a kind of internal adventure.\n \n2",
