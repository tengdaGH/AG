  "passage_text": "Reading Practice\n \nThe construction of roads and bridges\n \n \n \n \nRoads\nAlthough there were highway links in Mesopotamia from as early as 3500 bc, the Romans\nwere probably the first road-builders with fixed engineering standards. At the peak of the\nRoman Empire in the first century ad, Rome had road connections totalling about 85,000\nkilometres.\nRoman roads were constructed with a deep stone surface for stability and load-bearing.\nThey had straight alignments and therefore were often hilly. The Roman roads remained\nthe main arteries of European transport for many centuries, and even today many roads\nfollow the Roman routes. New roads were generally of inferior quality, and the\nachievements of Roman builders were largely unsurpassed until the resurgence of road-\nbuilding in the eighteenth century.\nWith horse-drawn coaches in mind, eighteenth-century engineers preferred to curve their\nroads to avoid hills. The road surface was regarded as merely a face to absorb wear, the\nload-bearing strength being obtained from a properly prepared and well-drained foundation.\nImmediately above this, the Scottish engineer John McAdam (1756-1836) typically laid\ncrushed stone, to which stone dust mixed with water was added, and which was\ncompacted to a thickness of just five centimetres, and then rolled. McAdam’s surface layer\n- hot tar onto which a layer of stone chips was laid - became known as ‘tarmacadam’, or\ntarmac. Roads of this kind were known as flexible pavements.\nBy the early nineteenth century - the start of the railway age - men such as John McAdam\nand Thomas Telford had created a British road network totalling some 200,000 km, of\nwhich about one sixth was privately owned toll roads called turnpikes. In the first half of the\nnineteenth century, many roads in the US were built to the new standards, of which the\nNational Pike from West Virginia to Illinois was perhaps the most notable.\nIn the twentieth century, the ever-increasing use of motor vehicles threatened to break up\nroads built to nineteenth-century standards, so new techniques had to be developed.\nOn routes with heavy traffic, flexible pavements were replaced by rigid pavements, in which\nthe top layer was concrete, 15 to 30 centimetres thick, laid on a prepared bed. Nowadays\nsteel bars are laid within the concrete. This not only restrains shrinkage during setting, but\nalso reduces expansion in warm weather. As a result, it is, possible to lay long slabs\nwithout danger of cracking.\nThe demands of heavy traffic led to the concept of high-speed, long-'distance roads, with\naccess - or slip-lanes - spaced widely apart. The US Bronx River Parkway of 1925 was\nfollowed by several variants - Germany’s autobahns and the Pan American Highway. Such\nroads - especially the intercity autobahns with their separate multi-lane carriageways for\neach direction - were the predecessors of today’s motorways.\nBridges\nThe development by the Romans of the arched bridge marked the beginning of scientific\nbridge-building; hitherto, bridges had generally been crossings in the form of felled trees or\nflat stone blocks. Absorbing the load by compression, arched bridges are very strong. Most\n \n1\n\nwere built of stone,\nbut brick and timber were also used. A fine early example is at Alcantara in Spain, built of\ngranite by the Romans in AD 105 to span the River Tagus. In modern times, metal and\nconcrete arched bridges have been constructed. The first significant metal bridge, built of\ncast iron in 1779, still stands at Ironbridge in England.\nSteel, with its superior strength-to-weight ratio, soon replaced iron in metal bridge-work. In\nthe railway age, the truss (or girder) bridge became popular. Built of wood or metal, the\ntruss beam consists of upper and lower horizontal booms joined by vertical or inclined\nmembers.\nThe suspension bridge has a deck supported by suspenders that drop from one or more\noverhead cables. It requires strong anchorage at each end to resist the inward tension of\nthe cables, and the deck is strengthened to control distortion by moving loads or high\nwinds. Such bridges are nevertheless light, and therefore the most suitable for very long\nspans. The Clifton Suspension Bridge in the UK, designed by Isambard Kingdom Brunei\n(1806—59) to span the Avon Gorge in England, is famous both for its beautiful setting and\nfor its elegant design. The 1998 Akashi Kaikyo Bridge in Japan has a span of 1,991\nmetres, which is the longest to date.\nCantilever bridges, such as the 1889 Forth Rail Bridge in Scotland, exploit the potential of\nsteel construction to produce a wide clearwater space. The spans have a central\nsupporting pier and meet midstream. The downward thrust, where the spans meet, is\ncountered by firm anchorage of the spans at their other ends. Although the suspension\nbridge can span a wider gap, the cantilever is relatively stable, and this was important for\nnineteenth-century railway builders. The world’s longest cantilever span - 549 metres - is\nthat of the Quebec rail bridge in Canada, constructed in 1918.\n \n2",
