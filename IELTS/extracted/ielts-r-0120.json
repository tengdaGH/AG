  "passage_text": "Reading Practice\n \nDeafhood\nA\nAt this point, you might be wondering: what does ‘deafhood’ mean? Is it a synonym for\n‘deafness’? Is it a slightly more politically correct term to express the very same concept\nyou’ve grown accustomed to-a person who lacks the power of hearing, or a person whose\nhearing is impaired? What’s wrong with terms like ‘hard of hearing’ or ‘deafness’? Have\nthey not represented the deaf community just fine for the past few centuries? Who came up\nwith the term ‘Deafhood’ anyway, and why?\nB\nThe term ‘Deafhood’ was first coined in 1993 by Dr Paddy Ladd, a deaf scholar in the Deaf\nStudies Department at the University of Bristol in England. First explored through his\ndoctoral dissertation in 1998, and later elaborated on in his 2003 book, ‘Understanding\nDeaf Culture – In Search of Deafhood‘, the idea behind Deafhood is twofold: first, it seeks\nto collect everything that is already known about the life, culture, politics, etc. of Sign\nLanguage Peoples (SLPs); secondly, it attempts to remove the limitations imposed on\nSLPs through their colonization from hearing people.\nC\nIn order to understand what Deafhood represents, it’s first important to understand what is\nmeant by colonisation. To do that, we need to examine two terms: Oralism and Audism.\nOralism is a philosophy that first emerged in the late 19th century, and which suggests that\nreduced use of sign language would be more beneficial to SLPs, as it would allow them to\nintegrate better to the hearing world. In that respect, sign language is dismissively regarded\nas a mere obstacle to listening skills and acquisition of speech-treated, in effect, in the\nsame manner as the languages of other peoples who were oppressed and colonised, e.g.\nthe Maori in New Zealand, or the Aborigines in Australia. Audism, however, is an even\nmore sinister ideology: first coined in 1975 by Dr Tom Humphries of the University of\nCalifornia in San Diego, it describes the belief that deaf people are somehow inferior to\nhearing people, and that deafhood – or, in this case, we should say ‘deafness’ – is a flaw, a\nterrible disability that needs to be eliminated. It is the effect of these two ideologies that\nDeafhood seeks to counter, by presenting SLPs in a positive light, not as patients who\nrequire treatment.\nD\nBut even if we understand the oppression that SLPs have suffered at the hands of hearing\npeople since the late 1800s, and even if we acknowledge that ‘deafness’ is a medical term\nwith negative connotations that need to be replaced, that doesn’t mean it’s easy to explain\nwhat the term Deafhood represents exactly. This is because Deafhood is, as Dr Donald\nGrushkin puts it, a ‘physical, emotional, mental, spiritual, cultural and linguistic’ journey that\nevery deaf person is invited-but not obligated-to embark on.\nE\nDeafhood is essentially a search for understanding: what does being ‘Deaf’ mean? How did\ndeaf people in the past define themselves, and what did they believe to be their reasons for\n \n1\n\nexisting before Audism was conceived? Why are some people born deaf? Are they\nbiologically defective, or are there more positive reasons for their existence? What do\nterms like ‘Deaf Art’ or ‘Deaf Culture’ actually mean? What is ‘the Deaf Way’ or doing\nthings? True Deafhood is achieved when a deaf person feels comfortable with who they\nare and connected to the rest of the deaf community through use of their natural language,\nbut the journey there might differ.\nF\nAside from all those questions, however, Deafhood also seeks to counter the eect of what\nis known as ‘neo-eugenics’. Neo-eugenics, as described by Patrick Boudreault at the 2005\nCalifornia Association of the Deaf Conference, is a modern manifestation of what has\ntraditionally been defined as ‘eugenics’, i.e. an attempt to eradicate any human\ncharacteristics which are perceived as negative. Deaf people have previously been a target\nof eugenicists through the aforementioned ideologies of Audism and Oralism, but recent\ndevelopments in science and society-such as cochlear implants or genetic engineering-\nmean that Deafhood is once again under threat, and needs to be protected. The only way\nto do this is by celebrating the community’s history, language, and countless contributions\nto the world, and confronting those who want to see it gone.\nG\nSo, how do we go forward? We should start by decolonising SLPs-by embracing Deafhood\nfor what it is, removing all the negative connotations that surround it and accepting that\ndeaf people are neither broken nor incomplete. This is a task not just for hearing people,\nbut for deaf people as well, who have for decades internalised society’s unfavourable views\nof them. We should also seek recognition of the deaf community’s accomplishments, as\nwell as official recognition of sign languages around the world by their respective\ngovernments. Effectively, what we should do is ask ourselves: how would the Deaf\ncommunity be like, had it never been colonised by the mainstream world? And whatever it\nis it would be like, we should all together-hearing and Deaf alike-strive to achieve it.\n \n2",
