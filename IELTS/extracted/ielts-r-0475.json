  "passage_text": "Reading Practice\n \nThe fluoridation controversy\nThe long-standing debate about whether to fluoridate our drinking water continues\nFluoridation is the addition of fluorine to public water supplies with the aim of reducing tooth\ndecay. The fluorine, when mixed with water, becomes fluoride and the desired\nconcentration of fluoride in public water is approximately one part per million, depending on\nthe regional temperature and hence the amount of water people are likely to drink. Many\nstudies, such as those by McClure in 1970 through to Burt in 1983, have shown that when\nchildren drink fluoridated water, their average rate of tooth decay seems greatly reduced. A\ntypical figure claimed is 50 percent reduction. This apparently enormous benefit for\nchildren's teeth is the major argument in favor of fluoridation.\nThree main grounds for opposition to fluoridation have been expressed. First, opponents\nclaim the benefits are exaggerated or not established. Second, there are claims of health\nrisks to pans of the population, for example, allergic reactions. It is also accepted that high\nlevels of fluoride can cause discoloration of otherwise healthy teeth. Proponents do not\nconsider this to be a problem in such small concentrations, whereas opponents disagree -\nespecially because some people drink more water and obtain much more than the\nstandard 1 milligram of fluoride per day. Third, fluoridation is thought to be an infringement\non individual rights because it is compulsory medication of all members of a community.\nAn understanding of the fluoridation issue has important implications. If, according to the\nexperts, fluoridation is unquestionably a beneficial and non-hazardous measure, then the\nwisdom of allowing the public to vote on, and reject it must be questioned.\nAlmost all studies that have been done have assumed that the scientific aspects of the\ncontroversy are unproblematic, and they have excluded science from sociological\nexamination. The traditional view is that science is a special kind of knowledge, which is\nestablished through scientific methods and objectively applied by members of a scientific\ncommunity. However, in recent years there has been a major challenge to this picture by a\nsociology of science that shows how scientific knowledge is socially negotiated, and\ninevitably linked to the values of the relevant parties, both scientists and nonscientists.\nThese challengers do not see scientific knowledge as exempt from social inquiry.\nKuhn (1970) argued that scientific knowledge does not always develop as an orderly\nprocess, but is characterized by periodic revolutions. in which the methods of study and the\nassessment criteria change in a fragmented way. According to Kuhn, the shift from one\nscientific way of thinking to another is not made solely on the basis of clear rules of formal\nscientific practice, but can include social factors, though Kuhn has never developed a full\nanalysis of what these might be. Collins (1975) took this concept further when he asserted\nthat the outcome of experiments was not something whose meaning could be immediately\ncomprehended, but rather something for interpretation, discussion between scientists, and\nreinterpretation in the light of other experiments.\nOne interpretation of this analysis of science is that traditional distinctions between facts\nand theories, and between scientific knowledge and values, can no longer be justified.\nBecause social processes are involved at all stages of the creation, evaluation, and\nestablishing of scientific knowledge, social values may also be involved.\nIn the same way as many scientists who study fluoridation have overlooked social values,\n \n1\n\nsociologists have also downplayed an important part of the debate by ignoring the number\nof eminent scientists who have questioned aspects of fluoridation. An example is the study\nby Sutton in 1960, which analyzed the classic North American studies of the effect of\nfluoridation on tooth decay, and found that each showed significant methodological\nshortcomings. Sutton's detailed study throws doubt as to the extent of reductions in tooth\ndecay from fluoridation. Yet Sutton's book is not cited in a single analysis of the fluoridation\nissue by any sociologist. In a situation of some scientific uncertainty, differences in values\nare highlighted. A supporter of fluoridation might argue. The evidence for the benefits of\nfluoridation is quite substantial, while the evidence for harm is limited and dubious. I think\nthe likely benefits outweigh the possible dangers; hence I support fluoridation because it is\nthe cheapest and easiest way to make sure every child reaps the benefits. An opponent\nmight argue, 'Though the evidence for the benefits of fluoridation is substantial, there is\nsome doubt about it. Since fluoridation is not necessary for good teeth, we should forego\nthe benefits if there is some slight chance of harm. Some scientists claim that a small\npercentage of the population could be harmed by fluoride. Therefore I oppose fluoridation\nof water supplies and favor the voluntary use of fluoride tablets by those who want to take\nthem.'\nBoth arguments consider the scientific evidence concerning fluoridation, but differ in their\nassessments of the social benefits and costs. This difference is not between rationality and\nirrationality but is a legitimate difference in values, for example, the positive value placed\non good teeth, the negative value placed on possible health risks, and the social benefits or\ncosts of compulsory or voluntary intake of fluorides.\nFrom the sociological point of view, opposition to fluoridation is not necessarily irrational.\nRather, claims to rationality and to scientific authority are better seen as part of a strategy\nto promote fluoridation than as incontrovertible statements of fact. Second, social values\nare likely to be bound up in any decision about fluoridation, so this is not an issue on which\ndeclarations by scientific experts ought to be considered the final word.\n \n2",
