Living in\nwhat is now China, the species would have resembled a strange bird. It was about the size\nof a sheep and covered in feathers, with a sharp beak that it probably used to crack open\nshellfish. It was given the formal scientific name Tongtianlong, but we called it ‘Mud\nDragon’ because its skeleton was discovered in rock that had hardened from ancient mud.\nIt seems that the creature got trapped in the mud and died. Then its fossil remains were\nfound a few months ago when workmen were excavating a site in order to build a school.\nIt is every dinosaur-obsessed child’s dearest wish to discover and name a completely new\nspecies. In fact what my colleagues and I did wasn’t that unusual. New dinosaurs are\nappearing everywhere these days – about 50 each year. And this pace shows no signs of\nslowing, as different areas continue to open up to fossil hunters and a fresh generation of\nscientists comes of age. Because of this plentiful supply of new fossils, we now know more\nabout dinosaurs than we do about many modern animals. But there are still many unsolved\nmysteries.\nDinosaurs didn’t start out as huge monsters like Tyrannosaurus Rex. Instead they evolved\nfrom a group of angular, cat-sized reptiles called dinosauromorphs. These creatures\nremained small and rare for millions of years until they developed into dinosaurs. The\nboundary between dinosauromorphs and dinosaurs is becoming less and less distinct with\neach new discovery that’s made, but what’s becoming clear is that it took millions of years\nfor these first dinosaurs to spread around the world, grow to huge sizes and become truly\ndominant.\nSome discoveries in the 1970s, like the agile and strangely bird-like Deinonychus, proved\nthat dinosaurs were far more dynamic and intelligent than previously thought. Some\npalaeontologists even proposed that they were warm-blooded creatures like modern birds\nwith a constant high body temperature that they controlled internally, rather than from\nwarming themselves by lying in the sun. A few decades later opinions are still mixed. The\nproblem is that dinosaurs can’t be observed. Palaeontologists must rely on studying fossils.\nSome results are convincing: we know from studying their bones that dinosaurs had rapid\ngrowth rates, just like modern, warm-blooded animals. Other palaeontologists, however,\nuse the same fossils to suggest that dinosaurs were somewhere between cold-blooded\nreptiles and warm-blooded birds. More studies are needed to provide more clarity.\nThe discovery of Deinonychus with its long arms, skinny legs, arched neck and big claws\non its feet, helped to strengthen the theory that birds evolved from dinosaurs. In the late\n1990s, the discovery of thousands of feather- covered dinosaurs closed the argument.\nBut the fossils raised another question: why did feathers first develop in dinosaurs? They\nprobably originated as simple, hair-like strands — a necessary means of keeping warm.\nMany dinosaurs retained this basic fluffy coat, but in one group the strands modified. They\ngrew bigger, started to branch out and changed into feathers like those on modern birds.\nThey lined the arms, and sometimes the legs, forming wings. These feathers were probably\nfor display: to attract mates or scare off rivals. They appeared in species such as the\n \n1\n\nostrich-like Ornithomimosaur. Such creatures were too large to fly. Flight may actually have\ncome about by accident when smaller winged dinosaurs began jumping between trees or\nleaping in the air, and suddenly found that their wings had aerodynamic properties. This is\none of the most stimulating new notions about dinosaurs and a fascinating area for further\ninvestigation.\nThere’s something else that these feathers can tell us. They allow us to determine what\ncolour dinosaurs were. If you look at modern bird feathers under a microscope, you can\nsee tiny blobs called melanosomes. These structures contain melanin, one of the main\ncolour-producing pigments in animals. Some are round, others are egg-shaped, etc. And\nthat’s important, because different shapes contain different colour pigments. So if you can\nidentify the shape, you can identify the colour. A few years ago, some palaeontologists\nrealised that you could find melanosomes in particularly well-preserved fossil feathers.\nThey discovered that different dinosaurs had different melanosomes, which meant they had\na variety of colours. Dinosaurs, therefore, probably came in a rainbow of colours – yet\nanother thing that links them to modern birds.\nThe most enduring mystery of all, which has been argued about ever since the first\ndinosaur fossils were found, is ‘Why aren’t dinosaurs around today?’ Of course, we now\nknow that birds evolved from dinosaurs, so some dinosaurs do continue in a sense. But\nthere’s nothing like a Tyrannosaurus Rex today. They dominated the planet for over 150\nmillion years, but suddenly disappeared from the fossil record 66 million years ago. That’s\nwhen a 10 km-wide asteroid came out of space and struck what is now Mexico, impacting\nwith huge force and unleashing earthquakes, tidal waves, wildfires and hurricane-force\nwinds. Although palaeontologists still like to argue about what part the asteroid played in\nthe dinosaurs’ extinction, there really isn’t much of a mystery left. The asteroid did it and did\nit quickly. There are few signs that dinosaurs were struggling before the impact. None\nsurvived except a few birds and some small furry mammals. They found themselves in an\nempty world, and as the planet started to recover, they evolved into new creatures,\nincluding the first apes, and so the long journey began to the beginning of humankind.\n \n2",
