  "passage_text": "Reading Practice\nRight and left-handedness in humans\nWhy do humans, virtually alone among all animal species, display a distinct left or right-\nhandedness? Not even our closest relatives among the apes possess such decided lateral\nasymmetry, as psychologists call it. Yet about 90 per cent of every human population that\nhas ever lived appears to have been right-handed. Professor Bryan Turner at Deakin\nUniversity has studied the research literature on left-handedness and found that\nhandedness goes with sidedness. So nine out of ten people are right-handed and eight are\nright-footed. He noted that this distinctive asymmetry in the human population is itself\nsystematic. “Humans think in categories: black and white, up and down, left and right. It”s a\nsystem of signs that enables us to categorise phenomena that are essentially ambiguous.’\nResearch has shown that there is a genetic or inherited element to handedness. But while\nleft-handedness tends to run in families, neither left nor right handers will automatically\nproduce off-spring with the same handedness; in fact about 6 per cent of children with two\nright-handed parents will be left-handed. However, among two left-handed parents,\nperhaps 40 per cent of the children will also be left-handed. With one right and one left-\nhanded parent, 15 to 20 per cent of the offspring will be left-handed. Even among identical\ntwins who have exactly the same genes, one in six pairs will differ in their handedness.\nWhat then makes people left-handed if it is not simply genetic? Other factors must be at\nwork and researchers have turned to the brain for clues. In the 1860s the French surgeon\nand anthropologist, Dr Paul Broca, made the remarkable finding that patients who had lost\ntheir powers of speech as a result of a stroke (a blood clot in the brain) had paralysis of the\nright half of their body. He noted that since the left hemisphere of the brain controls the\nright half of the body, and vice versa, the brain damage must have been in the brain’s left\nhemisphere. Psychologists now believe that among right-handed people, probably 95 per\ncent have their language centre in the left hemisphere, while 5 per cent have right sided\nlanguage. Left-handers, however, do not show the reverse pattern but instead a majority\nalso have their language in the left hemisphere. Some 30 per cent have right hemisphere\nlanguage.\nDr Brinkman, a brain researcher at the Australian National University in Canberra, has\nsuggested that evolution of speech went with right-handed preference. According to\nBrinkman, as the brain evolved, one side became specialised for fine control of movement\n(necessary for producing speech) and along with this evolution came right- hand\npreference. According to Brinkman, most left-handers have left hemisphere dominance but\nalso some capacity in the right hemisphere. She has observed that if a left-handed person\nis brain-damaged in the left hemisphere, the recovery of speech is quite often better and\nthis is explained by the fact that left-handers have a more bilateral speech function.\nIn her studies of macaque monkeys, Brinkman has noticed that primates (monkeys) seem\nto learn a hand preference from their mother in the first year of life but this could be one\nhand or the other. In humans, however, the specialisation in function of the two\nhemispheres results in anatomical differences: areas that are involved with the production\nof speech are usually larger on the left side than on the right. Since monkeys have not\nacquired the art of speech, one would not expect to see such a variation but Brinkman\nclaims to have discovered a trend in monkeys towards the asymmetry that is evident in the\nhuman brain.\n \n1\n\nTwo American researchers, Geschwind and Galaburda, studied the brains of human\nembryos and discovered that the left-right asymmetry exists before birth. But as the brain\ndevelops, a number of things can affect it. Every brain is initially female in its organisation\nand it only becomes a male brain when the male foetus begins to secrete hormones.\nGeschwind and Galaburda knew that different parts of the brain mature at different rates;\nthe right hemisphere develops first, then the left. Moreover, a girl’s brain develops\nsomewhat faster than that of a boy. So, if something happens to the brain’s development\nduring pregnancy, it is more likely to be affected in a male and the hemisphere more likely\nto be involved is the left. The brain may become less lateralised and this in turn could result\nin left-handedness and the development of certain superior skills that have their origins in\nthe left hemisphere such as logic, rationality and abstraction. It should be no surprise then\nthat among mathematicians and architects, left-handers tend to be more common and\nthere are more left-handed males than females.\nThe results of this research may be some consolation to left-handers who have for\ncenturies lived in a world designed to suit right-handed people. However, what is alarming,\naccording to Mr. Charles Moore, a writer and journalist, is the way the word “right”\nreinforces its own virtue. Subliminally he says, language tells people to think that anything\non the right can be trusted while anything on the left is dangerous or even sinister. We\nspeak of lefthanded compliments and according to Moore, “it is no coincidence that\nlefthanded children, forced to use their right hand, often develop a stammer as they are\nrobbed of their freedom of speech”. However, as more research is undertaken on the\ncauses of left-handedness, attitudes towards left-handed people are gradually changing for\nthe better. Indeed when the champion tennis player Ivan Lendl was asked what the single\nthing was that he would choose in order to improve his game, he said he would like to\nbecome a lefthander.\nGeoff Maslen\n \n2",
