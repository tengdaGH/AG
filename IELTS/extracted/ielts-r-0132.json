  "passage_text": "Reading Practice\n \nDigital diet\n{A} Telecommuting, Internet shopping and online meetings may save energy as compared\nwith in-person alternatives, but as the digital age moves on, its green reputation is turning a\nlot browner. E-mailing, number crunching and Web searches in the U.S. consumed as\nmuch as 61 billion kilowatt-hours last year, or 1.5 per cent of the nation’s electricity-half of\nwhich comes from coal. In 2005 the computers of the world ate up 123 billion kilowatt-hours\nof energy, a number that will double by 2010 if present trends continue, according to\nJonathan Koomey, a staff scientist at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. As a result,\nthe power bill to run a computer over its lifetime will surpass the cost of buying the machine\nin the first place giving Internet and computer companies a business reason to cut energy\ncosts, as well as an environmental one.                       \n{B} One of the biggest energy sinks comes not from the computers themselves but from\nthe air-conditioning needed to keep them from overheating. For every kilowatt-hour of\nenergy used for computing in a data centre, another kilowatt-hour is required to cool the\nfurnace-like racks of servers.\n \n{C} For Internet giant Google, this reality has driven efforts such as the installation of a\nsolar array that can provide 30 per cent of the peak power needs of its Mountain View,\nCalif., headquarters as well as increased purchases of renewable energy. But to deliver\nWeb pages within seconds, the firm must maintain hundreds of thousands of computer\nservers in cavernous buildings. “It’s a good thing to worry about server energy efficiency,”\nremarks Google’s green energy czar Bill Weihl. “We are actively working to maximize the\nefficiency of our data centres, which account for most of the energy Google consumes\nworldwide.” Google will funnel some of its profits into a new effort, dubbed RE<C (for\nrenewable energy cheaper than coal, as Google translates it) to make sources such as\nsolar-thermal, high-altitude wind and geothermal cheaper than coal “within years, not\ndecades, according to Weihl. .\n{D} In the meantime, the industry as a whole has employed a few tricks to save watts.\nEfforts include cutting down on the number of transformations the electricity itself must\nundergo before achieving the correct operating voltage; rearranging the stacks of servers\nand the mechanics of their cooling; and using software to create multiple “virtual”\ncomputers, rather than having to deploy several real ones. Such virtualization has allowed\ncomputer maker Hewlett-Packard to consolidate 86 data centers spread throughout the\nworld to just three, with three backups, says Pat Tiernan, the firm’s vice president of social\nand environmental responsibility.              \n{E} The industry is also tackling the energy issue at the computer-chip level. With every\ndoubling of processing power in recent years has come a doubling in power consumption.\nBut to save energy, chipmakers such as Intel and AMD have shifted to so-called multicore\ntechnology, which packs multiple processors into one circuit rather than separating them.\n“When we moved to multicore-away from a linear focus on megahertz and gigahertz—and\nthrottled down microprocessors, the energy savings were pretty substantial,” says Allyson\nKlein, Intel’s marketing manager for its Ecotech Initiative. Chipmakers continue to shrink\ncircuits on the nanoscale as well, which means a chip needs less electricity” to deliver the\n \n1\n\nsame performance, she adds.                    \n \n{F} With such chips, more personal computers will meet various efficiency standards, such\nas Energy Star compliance (which mandates that a desktop consume no more than 65\nwatts). The federal government, led by agencies such as NASA and the Department of\nDefense may soon require all their purchases to meet the Electronic Product\nEnvironmental Assessment Tool standard. And Google, Intel and others have formed the\nClimate Savers Computing Initiative, an effort to cut power consumption from all computers\nby 50 per cent by 2010.                              \n{G} Sleep modes and other power management tools built into most operating systems can\noffer savings today. Yet about 90 per cent of computers do not have such settings enabled,\naccording to Klein. Properly activated, they would prevent a computer from leading to the\nemission of thousands of kilograms of carbon dioxide from power plants every year. But if\npowering down or unplugging the computer (the only way it uses zero power) is not an\noption, then perhaps the most environmentally friendly use of all those wasted\ncomputing cycles is in helping to model climate change. The University of Oxford’s\nClimatePrediction.net offers an opportunity to at least predict the consequences of all that\ncoal burning.                                 \n{H}  CO2 Stats is a free tool that can be embedded into any Website to calculate the\ncarbon dioxide emissions associated with using it. That estimate is based on an\nassumption of 300 watts of power consumed by the personal computer, network and server\ninvolved- or 16.5 milligrams of CO2 emitted every second of use. “The typical carbon\nfootprint is roughly equivalent to 1.5 people breathing,” says physicist Alexander Wissner-\nGross of Harvard University, who co-created the Web tool.\n \n2",
