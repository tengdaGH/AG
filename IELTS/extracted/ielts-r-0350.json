  "passage_text": "Reading Practice\n \nPulling strings to build pyramids\nNo one knows exactly how the pyramids were built. Marcus Chown reckons the answer\ncould be 'hanging in the air'.\nThe pyramids of Egypt were built more than three thousand years ago, and no one knows\nhow. The conventional picture is that tens of thousands of slaves dragged stones on\nsledges. But there is no evidence to back this up. Now a Californian software\nconsultant called Maureen Clemmons has suggested that kites might have been involved.\nWhile perusing a book on the monuments of Egypt, she noticed a hieroglyph that showed a\nrow of men standing in odd postures. They were holding what looked like ropes that led, via\nsome kina of mechanical system, to a giant bird in the sky. She wondered if perhaps the\nbird was actually a giant kite, and the men were using it to lift a heavy object.\nIntrigued, Clemmons contacted Morteza Gharib, aeronautics professor at the California\nInstitute of Technology. He was fascinated by the idea. 'Coming from Iran, I have a\nkeen interest in Middle Eastern science/ he says. He too was puzzled by the picture that\nhad sparked Clemmons's interest. The object in the sky apparently had wings far too short\nand wide for a bird. The possibility certainly existed that it was a kite/ he says. And since\nhe needed a summer project for his student Emilio Graff, investigating the possibility of\nusing kites as heavy lifters seemed like a good idea.\nGharib and Graff set themselves the task of raising a 4.5-metre stone column from\nhorizontal to vertical, using no source of energy except the wind. Their initial\ncalculations and scale-model wind-tunnel experiments convinced them they wouldn't need\na strong wind to lift the 33.5-tonne column. Even a modest force, if sustained over a long\ntime, would do. The key was to use a pulley system that would magnify the applied force.\nSo they rigged up a tent-shaped scaffold directly above the tip of the horizontal column,\nwith pulleys suspended from the scaffold's apex. The idea was that as one end of the\ncolumn rose, the base would roll across the ground on a trolley.\nEarlier this year, the team put Clemmons's unlikely theory to the test, using a 40-square-\nmetre rectangular nylon sail. The kite lifted the column clean off the ground. 'We were\nabsolutely stunned,' Gharib says. The instant the sail opened into the wind, a huge\nforce was generated and the column was raised to the vertical in a mere 40 seconds.'\nThe wind was blowing at a gentle 16 to 20 kilometres an hour, little more than half what\nthey thought would be needed. What they had failed to reckon with was what\nhappened when the kite was opened. There was a huge initial force - five times larger than\nthe steady state force,' Gharib says. This jerk meant that kites could lift huge weights,\nGharib realised. Even a 300-tonne column could have been lifted to the vertical with 40 or\nso men and four or five sails. So Clemmons was right: the pyramid, builders could have\nused kites to lift massive stones into place. 'Whether they actually did is another matter,'\nGharib says. There are no pictures showing the construction of the pyramids, so there is no\nway to tell what really happened. The evidence for using kites to move large stones is no\nbetter or worse than the evidence for the brute force method,' Gharib says.\nIndeed, the experiments have left many specialists unconvinced. The evidence for\nkitelifting is non-existent,' says Willeke Wendrich, an associate professor of Egyptology at\n \n1\n\nthe University of California, Los Angeles.\nOthers feel there is more of a case for the theory. Harnessing the wind would not have\nbeen a problem for accomplished sailors like the Egyptians. And they are known to\nhave used wooden pulleys, which could have been made strong enough to bear the weight\nof massive blocks of stone. In addition, there is some physical evidence that the\nancient Egyptians were interested in flight. A wooden artefact found on the step pyramid\nat Saqqara looks uncannily like a modern glider. Although it dates from several\nhundred years after the building of the pyramids, its sophistication suggests that the\nEgyptians might nave been developing ideas of flight for a long time. And other ancient\ncivilisations certainly knew about kites; as early as 1250 BC, the Chinese were using them\nto deliver messages and dump flaming debris on their foes.\nThe experiments might even have practical uses nowadays. There are plenty of places\naround the globe where people have no access to heavy machinery, but do know how\nto deal with wind, sailing and basic mechanical principles. Gharib has already\nbeen contacted by a civil engineer in Nicaragua, who wants to put up buildings with\nadobe roofs supported by concrete arches on a site that heavy equipment can't reach. His\nidea is to build the arcnes horizontally, then lift them into place using kites. 'We've given\nhim some design hints,' says Gharib. We're just waiting for him to report back.' So\nwhether they were actually used to build the pyramids or not, it seems that kites may make\nsensible construction tools in the 21 st century AD.\n \n2",
