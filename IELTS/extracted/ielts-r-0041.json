  "passage_text": "Reading Practice\n \nArt to the aid of technology\n \nWhat caricatures can teach us about facial recognition\n \nA Our brains are incredibly agile machines, and it is hard to think of anything they do more\nefficiently than recognize faces. Just hours after birth, the eyes of newborns are drawn to\nfacelike patterns. An adult brain knows it is seeing a face within 100 milliseconds, and it\ntakes just over a second to realize that two different pictures of a face, even if they are lit or\nrotated in very different ways, belong to the same person.\n \nB Perhaps the most vivid illustration of our gift for recognition is the magic of caricature-the\nfact that the sparest cartoon of a familiar face, even a single line dashed off in two seconds,\ncan be identified by our brains in an instant. It is often said that a good caricature looks\nmore like a person than the person themselves. As it happens, this notion, counterintuitive\nthough it may sound, is actually supported by research. In the field of vision science, there\nis even a term for this seeming paradox-the caricature effect-a phrase that hints at how our\nbrains misperceive faces as much as perceive them.\n \nC Human faces are all built pretty much the same: two eyes above a nose that’s above a\nmouth, the features varying from person to person generally by mere millimetres. So what\nour brains look for, according to vision scientists, are the outlying features-those\ncharacteristics that deviate most from the ideal face we carry around in our heads, the\nrunning average of every \"visage\" we have ever seen. We code each new face we\nencounter not in absolute terms but in the several ways it differs markedly from the mean.\nIn other words, we accentuate what is most important for recognition and largely ignore\nwhat is not. Our perception fixates on the upturned nose, the sunken eyes or the fleshy\ncheeks, making them loom larger. To better identify and remember people, we turn them\ninto caricatures.\n \nD Ten years ago, we all imagined that as soon as surveillance cameras had been equipped\nwith the appropriate software, the face of a crime suspect would stand out in a crowd. Like\na thumbprint, its unique features and configuration would offer a biometric key that could be\nimmediately checked against any database of suspects. But now a decade has passed,\nand face-recognition systems still perform miserably in real-world conditions. Just recently,\na couple who accidentally swapped passports at an airport in England sailed through\nelectronic gates that were supposed to match their faces to file photos.\nE All this leads to an interesting question. What if, to secure our airports and national\nlandmarks, we need to learn more about caricature? After all, it's the skill of the caricaturist-\nthe uncanny ability to quickly distill faces down to their most salient features-that our\ncomputers most desperately need to acquire. Clearly, better cameras and faster computers\nsimply aren't going to be enough.\nF At the University of Central Lancashire in England, Charlie Frowd, a senior lecturer in\npsychology, has used insights from caricature to develop a better police-composite\ngenerator. His system, called EvoFIT, produces animated caricatures, with each\nsuccessive frame showing facial features that are more exaggerated than the last. Frowd's\nresearch supports the idea that we all store memories as caricatures, but with our own\npersonal degree of amplification. So, as an animated composite depicts faces at varying\nstages of caricature, viewers respond to the stage that is most recognizable to them. In\n \n1\n\n \ntests, Frowd's technique has increased positive identifications from as low as 3 percent to\nupwards of 30 percent.\n \nG To achieve similar results in computer face recognition, scientists would need to model\nthe artist’s genius even more closely-a feat that might seem impossible if you listen to\nsome of the artists describe their nearly mystical acquisition of skills. Jason Seiler recounts\nhow he trained his mind for years, beginning in middle school, until he gained what he\nregards as nothing less than a second sight. ‘A lot of people think that caricature is about\npicking out someone’s worst feature and exaggerating it as far as you can,' Seiler says.\n'That’s wrong. Caricature is basically finding the truth. And then you push the truth.'\nCapturing a likeness, it seems, has less to do with the depiction of individual features than\nwith their placement in relationship to one another. 'It's how the human brain recognizes a\nface. When the ratios between the features are correct, you see that face instantly.’\n \nH Pawan Sinha. director of MIT's Sinha Laboratory for Vision Research, and one of the\nnation's most innovative computer-vision researchers, contends that these simple,\nexaggerated drawings can be objectively and systematically studied and that such work will\nlead to breakthroughs in our understanding of both human and machine-based vision. His\nlab at MIT is preparing to computationally analyze hundreds of caricatures this year, from\ndozens of different artists, with the hope of tapping their intuitive knowledge of what is and\nisn’t crucial for recognition. He has named this endeavor the Hirschfeld Project, after the\nfamous New York Times caricaturist Al Hirschfeld.\n \nI Quite simply, by analyzing sketches, Sinha lopes to pinpoint the recurring exaggerations\nin the caricatures that most strongly correlate to particular ways that the original faces\ndeviate from the norm. The results, he believes, will ultimately produce a rank-ordered list\nof the 20 or so facial attributes that are most important for recognition: 'It’s a recipe for how\nto encode the face,' he says. In preliminary tests, the lab has already isolated important\nareas-for example, the ratio of the height of the forehead to the distance between the top of\nthe nose and the mouth. \nJ On a given face, four of 20 such Hirschfeld attributes, as Sinha plans to call them, will be\nseveral standard deviations greater than the mean; on another face, a different handful of\nattributes might exceed the norm. But in all cases, it's the exaggerated areas of the face\nthat hold the key. As matters stand today, an automated system must compare its target\nfaces against the millions of continually altering faces it encounters. But so far, the software\ndoesn't know what to look for amid this onslaught of variables. Armed with the Hirschfeld\nattributes, Sinha hopes that computers can be trained to focus on the features most salient\nfor recognition, tuning out the others. ’Then.’ Sinha says, ’the sky is the limit’.\n \n2",
