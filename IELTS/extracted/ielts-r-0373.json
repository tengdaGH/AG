Today, the mapmaker's vision is no longer confined to what the human eye can see.\nThe perspective of mapmaking has shifted from the crow's nest of the sailing vessel,\nmountain top and airplane to 'new orbital heights. Radar, which bounces microwave\nradio signals off a given surface to create images of its contours and textures, can\npenetrate jungle foliage and has produced the first maps of the mountains of the\nplanet Venus. And a combination of sonar and radar produces charts of the seafloor,\nputting much of Earth on the map for the first time. ‘Suddenly it's a whole different\nworld for US,’ says Joel Morrison, chief of geography at the U.S. Bureau of the\nCensus, ‘Our future as mapmakers - even ten years from now - is uncertain.’\nB. The world's largest collection of maps resides in the basement of the Library of\nCongress in Washington, D.c. The collection, consisting of up to 4,6 million map\nsheets and 63,000 atlases, includes magnificent bound collections of elaborate maps-\nthe pride of the golden age of Dutch cartography*. In the reading room scholars,\nwearing thin cotton gloves to protect the fragile sheets, examine ancient maps with\nmagnifying glasses. Across the room people sit at their computer screens, studying\nthe latest maps, with their prodigious memories, computers are able to store data\nabout people, places and environments - the stuff of maps - and almost instantly\ninformation is displayed on the screen in the desired geographic context, and at the\ndick of a button, a print-out of the map appears.\nC. Measuring the spherical Earth ranks as the first major milestone in scientific\n \ncartography. This was first achieved by the Greek astronomer Eratosthenes, a\nscholar at the famous Alexandrian Library in Egypt in the third century BC. He\ncalculated the Earth's circumference as 25,200 miles, which was remarkably\naccurate. The longitudinal circumference is known to be 24,860 miles.\nD. Building on the ideas of his predecessors, the astronomer and geographer Ptolemy,\nworking in the second century AD, spelled out a system for organizing maps\naccording to grids of latitude and longitude. Today, parallels of latitude are often\nspaced at intervals of 10 to 20 degrees and meridians** at 15 degrees, and this is the\nbasis for the width of modern time zones. Another legacy of Ptolemy's is his advice to\ncartographers to create maps to scale. Distance on today's maps is expressed as a\nfraction or ratio of the real distance. But mapmakers in Ptolemy's time lacked the\ngeographic knowledge to live up to Ptolemy's scientific principles. Even now, when\nsurveyors achieve accuracies down to inches and satellites can plot potential missile\ntargets within feet, maps are not true pictures of reality.\nE. However, just as the compass improved navigation and created demand for useful\ncharts, so the invention of the printing press in the 15th century put maps in the\nhands of more people, and took their production away from monks, who had tended\nto illustrate theology rather than geography. Ocean-going ships launched an age of\ndiscovery, enlarging both what could and needed to be mapped, and awakened an\nintellectual spirit and desire for knowledge of the world.\nF. Inspired by the rediscovered Ptolemy, whose writing had been preserved by Arabs\n \n1\n\n \n \nafter the sacking of the Alexandrian Library in AD 931, mapmakers in the 15th century\ngradually replaced theology with knowledge of faraway places, as reported by\ntravelling merchants like Marco Polo.\nG. Gerhardus Mercator, the foremost shipmaker of the 16th century, developed a\ntechnique of arranging meridians and parallels in such a way that navigators could\ndraw straight lines between two points and steer a constant compass course\nbetween them. This distortion formula, introduced on his world map of 1569, created\nthe ‘Greenland problem’. Even on some standard maps to this day, Greenland looks\nas large as South America - one of the many problems when one tries to portray a\nround world on a flat sheet of paper. But the Mercator projection was so practical that\nit is still popular with sailors.\nH. Scientific mapping of the land came into its own with the achievements of the Cassini\nfamily- father, son, grandson and great-grandson. In the late 17th century, the Italian\n- born founder, Jean-Dominique, invented a complex method of determining longitude\nbased on observations of Jupiter's moons. Using this technique, surveyors were able\nto produce an accurate map of France. The family continued to map the French\ncountryside arid his great-grandson finally published their famous Cassini map in\n1793 during the French Revolution. While it may have lacked the artistic appeal of\nearlier maps, it was the model of a social and geographic map showing roads, rivers,\ncanals, towns, abbeys, vineyards, lakes and even windmills.
