  "passage_text": "Reading Practice\n \nWhat is an ASBO\nAsk somebody to make a list of crimes and they will probably come up with the usual\nsuspects that you or I would: murder, robbery, assault, burglary and so on.They might even\ninclude acts which are merely’against the law’ like parking on a double yellow line.\nBut if you ask them to make a list of anti social behaviours, you are getting into an area\nwhere there is going to be considerable disagreement This didn’t stop the UK government\nwhich introduced Anti-Social Behaviour Orders, or ASBOs, in 1998 as part of the Crime\nand Disorder Act – legislation designed to deal with practically all aspects of criminal\nactivity and disorderly behaviour.\nA subjective definition of anti social behaviour permits you to cast your net wide and\ninclude anything you find personally disagreeable; the legal definition is also widely\ninclusive. To quote the Crime and Disorder Act it is behaviour which ’causes or is likely to\ncause harassment alarm or distress to one or more people who are not in the same\nhousehold as the perpetrator’. This includes, among many other things, foul and abusive\nlanguage, threatening behaviour, shouting, disorderly conduct, vandalism, intimidation,\nbehaviour as the result of drug or alcohol misuse, graffiti and noise which is excessive,\nparticularly at night.\nThe idea is that ASBOs are sanctions designed to deal with issues that affect everyone in\nthe community and as such are civil sanctions, not criminal ones, and need the cooperation\nof the community to be effective. For example, a private individual cannot apply for an\nASBO; he or she must make a complaint to the police or local authority, who will then work\ntogether to gather more information and build up evidence. This involves getting witnesses,\namong whom will no doubt be neighbours and acquaintances, to make statements to the\nauthorities. When the authorities are satisfied that they have enough evidence, the local\ncouncil applies to the magistrates’court to have an ASBO imposed\nWe still haven’t decided what constitutes anti-social behaviour. It doesn’t have to be\nphysical violence, of course, but is far easier to identify and deal with if it is. What about\nthreatening behaviour? We’re not talking here about direct threats such as ‘lf you come\nround here again. I’ll beat you up!’, but situations perceived as threatening. Let’s say a\npensioner or a person of timid disposition is on their way home and they run into a group of\nyoung people who are shouting, swearing and kicking a ball about and who happen to\nmake a few unkind . remarks as the person passes. Let’s say the person is alarmed or\nfeels threatened by the situation. Does it merit getting the ASBO process going?\nIn feet, young people merely hanging out in public places, however boisterous their\nbehaviour might seem to be to some people, are not considered to be indulging in anti-\nsocial behaviour. However, there is a proviso. Such behaviour in its own right is not\nconsidered anti-social unless it is thought it is being done with other, more serious,\nbehavioural attitudes involved. This, of course, can be very subjective.\nA person faced with an ASBO can argue in their defence that their behaviour was\nreasonable and unthreatening.This too is subjective, and both sides’ claims are open to\nwide interpretation. Something else that has to be taken into account here is that ASBOs\nare made on an individual basis even if that person is part of a group of people committing\nanti-social behaviour. If a case reaches the magistrates’court, witnesses can be called to\n \n1\n\nprovide further evidence for or against the defendant. However, the magistrate, as well as\nconsidering the complaints made against the defendant, will take into account his or her\nfamily situation, welfare issues, and whether or not he or she has been victimised or\ndiscriminated against It is worth bearing in mind, though, that witnesses can be intimidated\nor otherwise persuaded not to appear in court and give evidence.\nWhen the Crime and Disorder Act came into force, ASBOs were generally intended to be a\nmeasure to deal with adult anti social behaviour, yet within the Act it states that an order\ncan be applied for against any individual over the age often years old. It is a striking fact\nthat the majority of ASBOs imposed since the law was enacted have been handed out to\nyoung people and children.\nThe question is, have they been effective? The government, naturally, claims that they\nhave brought about a real improvement in the quality of life in communities around the\ncountry. Nay-sayers, such as civil rights campaigners, claim the measures are far too open\nto abuse. Some say they go too far and some that they don’t go far enough and lack bite.\nHowever, a genuine impediment to their effectiveness is that to impose an ASBO takes a\nlot of time and paperwork, involving the cooperation of community, police and local council,\nand they are very expensive to implement One estimate is that an ASBO can cost in\nexcess of £20,000. What all this means is that ASBOs are being used very rarely in many\nparts of the country. So the jury is still out as to how effective they really are.\n \n2",
