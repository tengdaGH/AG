  "passage_text": "Reading Practice\n \n \nAn assessment of micro-wind turbines\n \nA In terms of micro-renewable energy sources suitable for private use, a 15-kilowatt (kW)\nturbine is at the biggest end of the spectrum. With a nine metre diameter and a pole as\nhigh as a four-storey house, this is the most efficient form of wind microturbine, and the sort\nof thing you could install only if you had plenty of space and money. According to one\nestimate, a 15-kW micro-turbine (that’s one with the maximum output), costing £41,000 to\npurchase and a further £9,000 to install, is capable of delivering 25,000 kilowatt-hours\n(kWh)’ of electricity each year if placed on a suitably windy site.\n \nB I don’t know of any credible studies of the greenhouse gas emissions involved in\nproducing and installing turbines, so my estimates here are going to be even more broad\nthan usual. However, it is worth trying. If turbine manufacture is about as carbon intensive\nper pound sterling of product as other generators and electrical motors, which seems a\nreasonable assumption, the carbon intensity of manufacture will be around 640 kilograms\n(kg) per £1,000 of value. Installation is probably about as carbon intensive as typical\nconstruction, at around 380 kg per £1,000. That makes the carbon footprint (the total\namount of greenhouse gases that installing a turbine creates) 30 tonnes.\n \nC The carbon savings from wind-powered electricity generation depend on the carbon\nintensity of the electricity that you’re replacing. Let’s assume that your generation replaces\nthe coal-fuelled part of the country’s energy mix. In other words, if you live in the UK, let’s\nsay that rather than replacing typical grid electricity, which comes from a mix of coal, gas,\noil and renewable energy sources, the effect of your turbine is to reduce the use of coal-\nfired power stations. That’s reasonable, because coal is the least preferable source in the\nelectricity mix. In this case the carbon saving is roughly one kilogram per kWh, so you save\n25 tonnes per year and pay back the embodied carbon in just 14 months - a great start.\n \nD The UK government has recently introduced a subsidy for renewable energy that pays\nindividual producers 24p per energy unit on top of all the money they save on their own fuel\nbill, and on selling surplus electricity back to the grid at approximately 5p per unit. With all\nthis taken into account, individuals would get back £7,250 per year on their investment.\nThat pays back the costs in about six years. It makes good financial sense and, for people\nwho care about the carbon savings for their own sake, it looks like a fantastic move. The\ncarbon investment pays back in just over a year, and every year after that is a 25-tonne\ncarbon saving. (It’s important to remember that all these sums rely on a wind turbine having\na favourable location)\n \nE So, at face value, the turbine looks like a great idea environmentally, and a fairly good\nlong-term investment economically for the person installing it. However, there is a crucial\nperspective missing from the analysis so far. Has the government spent its money wisely?\nIt has invested 24p per unit into each micro-turbine. That works out at a massive £250 per\ntonne of carbon saved. My calculations tell me that had the government invested its money\nin offshore wind farms, instead of subsidising smaller domestic turbines, they would have\nbroken even after eight years. In other words, the micro-turbine works out as a good\ninvestment for individuals, but only because the government spends, and arguably wastes,\nso much money subsidising it. Carbon savings are far lower too.\nF Nevertheless, although the micro-wind turbine subsidy doesn’t look like the very best way\nof spending government resources on climate change mitigation, we are talking about\n \n1\n\n \ninvesting only about 0.075 percent per year of the nation’s GDP to get a one percent\nreduction in carbon emissions, which is a worthwhile benefit. In other words, it could be\nmuch better, but it could be worse. In addition, such investment helps to promote and\nsustain developing technology.\nG There is one extra favourable way of looking at the micro-wind turbine, even if it is not\nthe single best way of investing money in cutting carbon. Input- output modelling has told\nus that it is actually quite difficult to spend money without having a negative carbon impact.\nSo if the subsidy encourages people to spend their money on a carbon-reducing\ntechnology such as a wind turbine, rather than on carbon-producing goods like cars, and\nservices such as overseas holidays, then the reductions in emissions will be greater than\nmy simple sums above have suggested. \n \n2",
