  "passage_text": "Reading Practice\n \nBeing Left-handed in a Right-handed World\n \nThe world is designed for right-handed people. Why does a tenth of the population\nprefer the left?\n \nA The probability that two right-handed people would have a left-handed child is only about\n9.5 percent. The chance rises to 19.5 percent if one parent is a lefty and 26 percent if both\nparents are left-handed. The preference, however, could also stem from an infant’s\nimitation of his parents. To test genetic influence, starting in the 1970s British biologist\nMarian Annett of the University of Leicester hypothesized that no single gene determines\nhandedness. Rather, during fetal development, a certain molecular factor helps to\nstrengthen the brain’s left hemisphere, which increases the probability that the right hand\nwill be dominant, because the left side of the brain controls the right side of the body, and\nvice versa. Among the minority of people who lack this factor, handedness develops\nentirely by chance. Research conducted on twins complicates the theory, however. One in\nfivesets of identical twins involves one right-handed and one left-handed person, despite\nthe fact that their genetic material is the same. Genes, therefore, are not solely responsible\nfor handedness.\n \nB Genetic theory is also undermined by results from Peter Hepper and his team at Queen’s\nUniversity in Belfast, Ireland. In 2004 the psychologists used ultrasound to show that by the\n15th week of pregnancy, fetuses already have a preference as to which thumb they suck.\nIn most cases, the preference continued after birth. At 15 weeks, though, the brain does\nnot yet have control over the body’s limbs. Hepper speculates that fetuses tend to prefer\nwhichever side of the body is developing quicker and that their movements, in turn,\ninfluence the brain’s development. Whether this early preference is temporary or holds up\nthroughout development and infancy is unknown. Genetic predetermination is also\ncontradicted by the widespread observation that children do not settle on either their right\nor left hand until they are two or three years old.\n \nC But even if these correlations were true, they did not explain what actually causes left-\nhandedness. Furthermore, specialization on either side of the body is common among\nanimals. Cats will favor one paw over another when fishing toys out from under the couch.\nHorses stomp more frequently with one hoof than the other. Certain crabs motion\npredominantly with the left or right claw. In evolutionary terms, focusing power and dexterity\nin one limb is more efficient than having to train two, four or even eight limbs equally. Yet\nfor most animals, the preference for one side or the other is seemingly random. The\noverwhelming dominance of the right hand is associated only with humans. That fact\ndirects attention toward the brain’s two hemispheres and perhaps toward language.\nD Interest in hemispheres dates back to at least 1836. That year, at a medical conference,\nFrench physician Marc Dax reported on an unusual commonality among his patients.\nDuring his many years as a country doctor, Dax had encountered more than 40 men and\nwomen for whom speech was difficult, the result of some kind of brain damage. What was\nunique was that every individual suffered damage to the left side of the brain. At the\n \n1\n\nconference, Dax elaborated on his theory, stating that each half of the brain was\nresponsible for certain functions and that the left hemisphere controlled speech. Other\nexperts showed little interest in the Frenchman’s ideas. Over time, however, scientists\nfound more and more evidence of peopleexperiencing speech difficulties following injury to\nthe left brain. Patients with damage to the right hemisphere most often displayed\ndisruptions in perception or concentration. Major advancements in understanding the\nbrain’s asymmetry were made in the 1960s as a result of so-called split-brain surgery,\ndeveloped to help patients with epilepsy. During this operation, doctors severed the corpus\ncallosum—the nerve bundle that connects the two hemispheres. The surgical cut also\nstopped almost all normal communication between the two hemispheres, which offered\nresearchers the opportunity to investigate each side’s activity.\n \nE  In 1949 neurosurgeon Juhn Wada devised the first test to provide access to the brain’s\nfunctional organization of language. By injecting an anesthetic into the right or left carotid\nartery, Wada temporarily paralyzed one side of a healthy brain, enabling him to more\nclosely study the other side’s capabilities. Based on this approach, Brenda Milner and the\nlate Theodore Rasmussen of the Montreal Neurological Institute published a major study in\n1975 that confirmed the theory that country doctor Dax had formulated nearly 140 years\nearlier: in 96 percent of right-handed people, language is processed much more intensely\nin the left hemisphere. The correlation is not as clear in lefties, however. For two thirds of\nthem, the left hemisphere is still the most active language processor. But for the remaining\nthird, either the right side is dominant or both sides work equally, controlling different\nlanguage functions. That last statistic has slowed acceptance of the notion that the\npredominance of right-handedness is driven by left-hemisphere dominance in language\nprocessing. It is not at all clear why language control should somehow have dragged the\ncontrol of body movement with it. Some experts think one reason the left hemisphere\nreigns over language is because the organs of speech processing—the larynx and\ntongue—are positioned on the body’s symmetry axis. Because these structures were\ncentered, it may have been unclear, in evolutionary terms, which side of the brain should\ncontrol them, and it seems unlikely that shared operation would result in smooth motor\nactivity. Language and handedness could have developed preferentially for very different \nreasons  as  well.  For  example,  some  researchers,  including evolutionary psychologist\nMichael C. Corballis of the University of Auckland in New Zealand, think that the origin of\nhuman speech lies in gestures. Gestures predated words and helped language emerge. If\nthe left hemisphere began to dominate speech, it would have dominated gestures, too, and\nbecause the left brain controls the right side of the body, the right hand developed more\nstrongly.\nF Perhaps we will know more soon. In the meantime, we can revel in what, if any,\ndifferences handedness brings to our human talents. Popular wisdom says right-handed,\nleft-brained people excel at logical, analytical thinking. Lefthanded, right-brained individuals\nare thought to possess more creative skills and may be better at combining the functional\nfeatures emergent in both sides of the brain. Yet some neuroscientists see such claims as\npure speculation. Fewer scientists are  ready to claim that left-handedness means greater\ncreative potential. Yet lefties are prevalent among artists, composers and the generally\nacknowledged great political thinkers. Possibly if these individuals are among the lefties\nwhose language abilities are evenly distributed between hemispheres, the intense interplay\nrequired could lead to unusual mental capabilities.\n \n2\n\n \nG Or perhaps some lefties become highly creative simply because they must be more\nclever to get by in our right-handed world. This battle, which begins during the very early\nstages of childhood, may lay the groundwork for exceptional achievements.\n \n3",
