  "passage_text": "Reading Practice\n \nThe discovery of a baby mammoth\n \nA near-perfect frozen mammoth offers clues to a great vanished species\n \nA On a May morning in 2007, on the Yamal Peninsula in northwestern Siberia, a Nenets\nreindeer herder named Yuri Khudi stood on a sandbar on the Yuribey River, looking\ncarefully at a diminutive corpse. Although he'd never seen such an animal before, Khudi\nhad seen many mammoth tusks, the thick corkscrew shafts that his people found each\nsummer, and this persuaded him the corpse was a baby mammoth. It was eerily well\npreserved. Apart from its missing hair and toenails, it was perfectly intact. Khudi realised\nthe find might be significant and he knew he couldn't just return home and forget all about\nit. He therefore decided to travel to the small town of Yar Sale to consult an old friend\nnamed Kirill Serotetto. His friend took him to meet the director of the local museum, who\npersuaded the local authorities to fly Khudi and Serotetto back to the Yuribey River to\ncollect the baby mammoth.\nB Mammoths became extinct between 14,000 and 10,000 years ago and since the\nextinctions coincided with the end of the most recent Ice age, many researchers believe\nthat the primary cause of the great die-off was the sharp rise in temperature, which\ndramatically altered the vegetation. 'We have strong evidence that the temperature rise\nplayed a significant part in their extinction.’ says Adrian Lister, a palaeontologist and\nmammoth expert at London's Natural History Museum. 'In Eurasia, the timing of the two\nevents matches closely.' The extinctions also coincided, however, with the arrival of\nmodern humans. In addition to exploiting mammoths for food, they used their bones and\ntusks to make weapons, tools, and even dwellings. Some scientists believe humans were\nas much to blame as the temperature rise for the great die-off. Some say they caused it.\n \nC The body of the baby mammoth was eventually sent to the st Petersburg Zoological\nMuseum in Russia. Alexei Tikhonov, the museum's director, was one of the first scientists\nto view the baby, a female. According to Tikhonov, Khudi had rescued 'the best preserved\nmammoth to come down to US from the Ice Age', and he gratefully named her Lyuba, after\nKhudi's wife. Tikhonov knew that no-one would be more excited by the find than Dan\nFisher, an American colleague at the University of Michigan who had spent 30 years\nresearching the lives of mammoths. Tikhonov invited Fisher, along with Bernard Buigues, a\nFrench mammoth hunter, to come and view the baby mammoth. Fisher and Buigues had\nexamined other specimens together, including infants, but these had been in a relatively\npoor state. Lyuba was another story entirely, other than the missing hair and toenails, the\nonly flaw in her pristine appearance was a curious dent above the trunk.\nD Fisher was particularly excited about one specific part of Lyuba's anatomy: her milk\ntusks. Through his career, Fisher has taken hundreds of tusk samples. Most of these came\nfrom the Great Lakes region of North America, and his research showed that these animals\ncontinued to thrive, despite the late Pleistocene* temperature change. On the other hand,\nPleistocene era: the time between roughly 2.6 million years ago and 10.000 years ago to\nFisher the tusks often revealed telltale evidence of human hunting. His samples frequently\ncame from animals that had died in the autumn, when they should have been at their peak\nafter summer grazing, and less likely to die of natural causes, but also when humans would\nhave been most eager to stockpile meat for the coming winter. He has done limited work in\nSiberia, but his analysis of tusks from Wrangel Island, off the coast of Siberia, suggests the\n \n1\n\n \nsame conclusion.\n \nE In December 2007, Buigues arranged for the specimen to be transported to Japan to\nundergo a CT scan by Naoki Suzuki of the Jikei University School of Medicine. The test\nconfirmed her skeleton was undamaged, and her internal organs seemed largely intact. It\nalso showed that the end of her trunk, and her throat, mouth, and windpipe were filled with\ndense sediment. Six months later, in a laboratory in st Petersburg, Fisher, Buigues, Suzuki,\nTikhonov and other colleagues began a three-day series of tests on Lyuba. During these,\nFisher noted a dense mix of clay and sand in her trunk, mouth and throat, which had been\nindicated earlier by the scan. In fact, the sediment in Lyuba's trunk was packed so tightly\nthat Fisher saw it as a possible explanation for the dent above her trunk. If she was\nfrantically fighting for breath and inhaled convulsively, perhaps a partial vacuum was\ncreated in the base of her trunk, which would have flattened surrounding soft tissue. To\nFisher, the circumstances of Lyuba's death were clear: she had asphyxiated. Suzuki,\nhowever, proposed a different interpretation, seeing more evidence for drowning than\nasphyxiation.\nF Studies are ongoing, but Lyuba has begun to shed the secrets of her short life and some\nclues to the fate of her kind. Her good general health was shown in the record of her dental\ndevelopment, a confirmation for Fisher that dental research is useful for evaluating health\nand thus key to investigating the causes of mammoth extinction. Analysis of her well-\npreserved DNA has revealed that she belonged to a distinct population of Mammuthus\nprimigenius and that, soon after her time, another population migrating to Siberia from\nNorth America would take their place. Finally, Lyuba's premolars and tusks revealed that\nshe had been born in late spring and was only a month old when she died.\n \n2",
