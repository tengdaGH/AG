  "passage_text": "Reading Practice\n \nBovids\nA\n \nThe family of mammals called bovids belongs to the Artiodactyl class, which also includes\ngiraffes. Bovids are a highly diverse group consisting of 137 species, some of which are\nman’s most important domestic animals.\nB\nBovids are well represented in most parts of Eurasia and Southeast Asian islands, but they\nare by far the most numerous and diverse in the latter Some species of bovid are solitary,\nbut others live in large groups with complex social structures. Although bovids have\nadapted to a wide range of habitats, from arctic tundra to deep tropical forest, the majority\nof species favour open grassland, scrub or desert. This diversity of habitat is also matched\nby great diversity in size and form: at one extreme is the royal antelope of West Africa,\nwhich stands a mere 25 cm at the shoulder; at the other, the massively built bison of North\nAmerica and Europe, growing to a shoulder height of 2.2m.\nC\nDespite differences in size and appearance, bovids are united by the possession of certain\ncommon features. All species are ruminants, which means that they retain undigested food\nin their stomachs, and regurgitate it as necessary. Bovids are almost exclusively\nherbivorous: plant-eating “incisors: front teeth herbivorous”.\nD\nTypically their teeth are highly modified for browsing and grazing: grass or foliage is\ncropped with the upper lip and lower incisors** (the upper incisors are usually absent), and\nthen ground down by the cheek teeth. As well as having cloven, or split, hooves, the males\nof ail bovid species and the females of most carry horns. Bovid horns have bony cores\ncovered in a sheath of horny material that is constantly renewed from within; they are\nunbranched and never shed. They vary in shape and size: the relatively simple horns of a\nlarge Indian buffalo may measure around 4 m from tip to tip along the outer curve, while the\nvarious gazelles have horns with a variety of elegant curves.\nE\nFive groups, or sub-families, may be distinguished: Bovinae, Antelope, Caprinae,\nCephalophinae and Antilocapridae. The sub-family Bovinae comprises most of the larger\nbovids, including the African bongo, and nilgae, eland, bison and cattle. Unlike most other\nbovids they are all non-territorial. The ancestors of the various species of domestic cattle\nbanteng, gaur, yak and water buffalo are generally rare and endangered in the wild, while\nthe auroch (the ancestor of the domestic cattle of Europe) is extinct.\nF\nThe term ‘antelope is not a very precise zoological name – it is used to loosely describe a\nnumber of bovids that have followed different lines of development. Antelopes are typically\n \n1\n\nlong-legged, fast-running species, often with long horns that may be laid along the back\nwhen the animal is in full flight. There are two main sub-groups of antelope: Hippotraginae,\nwhich includes the oryx and the addax, and Antilopinae, which generally contains slighter\nand more graceful animals such as gazelle and the springbok. Antelopes are mainly\ngrassland species, but many have adapted to flooded grasslands: pukus, waterbucks and\nlechwes are all good at swimming, usually feeding in deep water, while the sitatunga has\nlong, splayed hooves that enable it to walk freely on swampy ground.\nG\nThe sub-family Caprinae includes the sheep and the goat, together with various relatives\nsuch as the goral and the tahr. Most are woolly or have long hair. Several species, such as\nwild goats, chamois and ibex, are agile cliff – and mountain-dwellers. Tolerance of extreme\nconditions is most marked in this group: Barbary and bighorn sheep have adapted to arid\ndeserts, while Rocky Mountain sheep survive high up in mountains and musk oxen in arctic\ntundra.\nH\nThe duiker of Africa belongs to the Cephalophinae sub-family. It is generally small and\nsolitary, often living in thick forest. Although mainly feeding on grass and leaves, some\nduikers – unlike most other bovids – are believed to eat insects and feed on dead animal\ncarcasses, and even to kill small animals.\nI\nThe pronghorn is the sole survivor of a New World sub-family of herbivorous ruminants, the\nAntilocapridae in North America. It is similar in appearance and habits to the Old World\nantelope. Although greatly reduced in numbers since the arrival of Europeans, and the\nsubsequent enclosure of grasslands, the pronghorn is still found in considerable numbers\nthroughout North America, from Washington State to Mexico. When alarmed by the\napproach of wolves or other predators, hairs on the pronghorn’s rump stand erect, so\nshowing and emphasizing the white patch there. At this signal, the whole herd gallops off at\nspeed of over 60 km per hour.\n \n2",
