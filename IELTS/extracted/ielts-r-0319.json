  "passage_text": "Reading Practice\n \nNurturing talent within the family\nWhat do we mean by being ‘talented’ or ‘gifted’? The most obvious way is to look at the\nwork someone does and if they are capable of significant success, label them as talented.\nThe purely quantitative route - ‘percentage definition’ - looks not at individuals, but at\nsimple percentages, such as the top five per cent of the population, and labels them - by\ndefinition - as gifted. This definition has fallen from favour, eclipsed by the advent of IQ\ntests, favoured by luminaries such as Professor Hans Eysenck, where a series of written or\nverbal tests of general intelligence leads to a score of intelligence.\nThe IQ test has been eclipsed in turn. Most people studying intelligence and creativity in\nthe new millennium now prefer a broader definition, using a multifaceted approach where\ntalents in many areas are recognised rather than purely concentrating on academic\nachievement. If we are therefore assuming that talented, creative or gifted individuals may\nneed to be assessed across a range of abilities, does this mean intelligence can run in\nfamilies as a genetic or inherited tendency? Mental dysfunction - such as schizophrenia -\ncan, so is an efficient mental capacity passed on from parent to child?\nAnimal experiments throw some light on this question, and on the whole area of whether it\nis genetics, the environment or a combination of the two that allows for intelligence and\ncreative ability. Different strains of rats show great differences in intelligence or ‘rat\nreasoning’. If these are brought up in normal conditions and then mn through a maze to\nreach a food goal, the ‘bright’ strain make far fewer wrong turns that the ‘dull’ ones. But if\nthe environment is made dull and boring the number of errors becomes equal. Return the\nrats to an exciting maze and the discrepancy returns as before - but is much smaller. In\nother words, a dull rat in a stimulating environment will almost do as well as a bright rat\nwho is bored in a normal one. This principle applies to humans too - someone may be\nborn with innate intelligence, but their environment probably has the final say over whether\nthey become creative or even a genius.\nEvidence now exists that most young children, if given enough opportunities and\nencouragement, are able to achieve significant and sustainable levels of academic or\nsporting prowess. Bright or creative children are often physically very active at the same\ntime, and so may receive more parental attention as a result - almost by default - in order to\nensure their safety. They may also talk earlier, and this, in turn, breeds parental interest.\nThis can sometimes cause problems with other siblings who may feel jealous even though\nthey themselves may be bright. Their creative talents may be undervalued and so never\ncome to fruition. Two themes seem to run through famously creative families as a result.\nThe first is that the parents were able to identify the talents of each child, and nurture and\nencourage these accordingly but in an even-handed manner. Individual differences were\nencouraged, and friendly sibling rivalry was not seen as a particular problem. If the father\nis, say, a famous actor, there is no undue pressure for his children to follow him onto the\nboards, but instead their chosen interests are encouraged. There need not even by any\nobvious talent in such a family since there always needs to be someone who sets the\nfamily career in motion, as in the case of the Sheen acting dynasty.\nMartin Sheen was the seventh of ten children born to a Spanish immigrant father and an\nIrish mother. Despite intense parental disapproval he turned his back on entrance exams to\nuniversity and borrowed cash from a local priest to start a fledgling acting career. His acting\n \n1\n\nsuccesses in films such as Badlands and Apocalypse Now made him one of the most\nhighly-regarded actors of the 1970s. Three sons - Emilio Estevez, Ramon Estevez and\nCharlie Sheen - have followed him into the profession as a consequence of being inspired\nby his motivation and enthusiasm.\nA stream seems to run through creative families. Such children are not necessarily\nsmothered with love by their parents. They feel loved and wanted, and are secure in their\nhome, but are often more surrounded by an atmosphere of work and where following a\ncalling appears to be important. They may see from their parents that it takes time and\ndedication to be master of a craft, and so are in less of a hurry to achieve for themselves\nonce they start to work.\nThe generation of creativity is complex: it is a mixture of genetics, the environment,\nparental teaching and luck that determines how successful or talented family members are.\nThis last point - luck - is often not mentioned where talent is concerned but plays an\nundoubted part. Mozart, considered by many to be the finest composer of all time, was\nlucky to be living in an age that encouraged the writing of music. He was brought up\nsurrounded by it, his father was a musician who encouraged him to the point of giving up\nhis job to promote his child genius, and he learnt musical composition with frightening\nspeed - the speed of a genius. Mozart himself simply wanted to create the finest music\never written but did not necessarily view himself as a genius - he could write sublime music\nat will, and so often preferred to lead a hedonistic lifestyle that he found more exciting than\nwriting music to order.\n \nAlbert Einstein and Bill Gates are two more examples of people whose talents have\nblossomed by virtue of the times they were living in. Einstein was a solitary, somewhat slow\nchild who had affection at home but whose phenomenal intelligence emerged without any\nobvious parental input. This may have been partly due to the fact that at the start of the\n20th Century a lot of the Newtonian laws of physics were being questioned, leaving a fertile\nground for ideas such as his to be developed. Bill Gates may have had the creative vision\nto develop Microsoft, but without the new computer age dawning at the same time he may\nnever have achieved the position on the world stage he now occupies.\n \n2",
