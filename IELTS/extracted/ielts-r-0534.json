Nowadays, however, the term ‘climate change’ is generally used when referring to\nchanges in our climate which have been identified since the early part of the twentieth\ncentury. The changes we’ve seen over recent years and those which are predicted to occur\nover the next 100 years are thought by many to be largely a result of human behavior\nrather than due to natural changes in the atmosphere. And this is what is so significant\nabout current climactic trends; never before has man played such a significant role in\ndetermining long-term weather patterns – we are entering the unknown and there is no\nprecedent for what might happen next.\nB\nThe greenhouse effect is very important when we talk about climate change as it relates to\nthe gases which keep the Earth warm. Although the greenhouse effect is a naturally\noccurring phenomenon, it is believed that the effect could be intensified by human activity\nand the emission of gases into the atmosphere. It is the extra greenhouse gases which\nhumans have released which are thought to pose the strongest threat. Certain researchers,\nsuch as Dr Michael Crawley, argue: ‘even though this natural phenomenon does exist it is\nwithout a doubt human activity that has worsened its effect; this is evident when comparing\ndata regarding the earth’s temperature in the last one hundred years with the one hundred\nyears prior to that.’ Some scientists, however, dispute this as Dr Ray Ellis suggests:\n‘human activity may be contributing a small amount to climate change but this increase in\ntemperature is an unavoidable fact based on the research data we have compiled.\nC\nScientists around the globe are looking at all the evidence surrounding climate change and\nusing advanced technology have come up with predictions for our future environment and\nweather. The next stage of that work, which is just as important, is looking at the knock-on\neffects of potential changes. For example, are we likely to see an increase in precipitation\nand sea levels? Does this mean there will be an increase in flooding and what can we do to\nprotect ourselves from that? How will our health be affected by climate change, how will\nagricultural practices change and how will wildlife cope?
