  "passage_text": "Reading Practice\n \n \nThe world’s friendliest city\nA team of social psychologists from California has spent six years studying the reactions of\npeople in cities around the world to different situations. The results show that cities where\npeople have less money generally have friendlier populations. Rio de Janeiro in Brazil,\nwhich is often known for its crime, comes out top, and the capital of Malawi, Lilongwe,\ncomes third. \nBut what makes one city friendlier than another? The psychologists from California State\nUniversity say it has got more to do with environment than culture or nationality. \nThey carried out a study into the way locals treated strangers in 23 cities around the world.\nThe team conducted their research through a series of tests, where they dropped pens or\npretended they were blind and needed help crossing the street. \nThe study concludes that people are more helpful in cities with a more relaxed way of\nlife such as Rio. While they were there, researchers received help in 93 percent of cases,\nand the percentage in Lilong we was only a little lower. However, richer cities such as\nAmsterdam and New York are considered the least friendly. Inhabitants of Amsterdam\nhelped the researchers in 53 percent of cases and in New York just 44 percent. The\npsychologists found that, in these cities, people tend to be short of time, so they hurry and\noften ignore strangers.\n \n1",
