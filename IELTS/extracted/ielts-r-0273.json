  "passage_text": "Reading Practice\n \nMalaria Combat in Italy\nA\nMal-aria. Bad air. Even the world is Italian, and this horrible disease marked the life of\nthose in the peninsula for thousands of years. Giuseppe Garibaldi’s wife died of the\ndisease, as did the country’s first prime minister, Cavour, in 1861. Yet by 1962, Italy was\nofficially declared malaria-free, and it has remained so ever since. Frank Snowden’s study\nof this success story is a remarkable piece of historical work. Original, crystal-clear,\nanalytical and passionate, Snowden (who has previously written about cholera) takes us to\nareas historians have rarely visited before.\nB\nEverybody now knows that malaria is carried by mosquitoes. Malaria has always been the\nsubject of research for medical practitioners from time immemorial. However, many ancient\ntexts, especially medical literature, mention of various aspects of malaria and even of its\npossible link with mosquitoes and insects. Early man, confronting the manifestations of\nmalaria, attributed the fevers to supernatural influences: evil spirits, angered deities, or the\nblack magic of sorcerers. But in the 19th century, most experts believed that the disease\nwas not produced by unclean air (“miasma” or “poisoning of the air”). Two Americans,\nJosiah Clark Nott and Lewis Daniel Beauperthy, echoed Crawford’s ideas. Nott in his essay\n“Yellow Fever Contrasted with Bilious Fever,” published in 1850, dismissed the miasma\ntheory as worthless, arguing that microscopic insects somehow transmitted by mosquitoes\ncaused both malaria and yellow fever. Others made a link between swamps, water and\nmalaria, but did not make the further leap towards insects. The consequences of these\ntheories were that little was done to combat the disease before the end of the century.\nThings became so bad that 11m Italians (from a total population of 25m) were\n“permanently at risk”. In malarial zones, the life expectancy of land workers was a terrifying\n22.5 years. Those who escaped death were weakened or suffered from splenomegaly – a\n“painful enlargement of the spleen” and “a lifeless stare”. The economic impact of the\ndisease was immense. Epidemics were blamed on southern Italians, given the widespread\nbelief that malaria was hereditary. In the 1880s, such theories began to collapse as the\ndreaded mosquito was identified as the real culprit.\nC\nItalian scientists, drawing on the pioneering work of French doctor Alphonse Laveran, were\nable to predict the cycles of fever but it was in Rome that further key discoveries were\nmade. Giovanni Battista Grassi, a naturalist, found that a particular type of mosquito was\nthe carrier of malaria. By experimenting on healthy volunteers (mosquitoes were released\ninto rooms where they drank the blood of the human guinea pigs), Grassi was able to make\nthe direct link between the insects (all females of a certain kind) and the disease. Soon,\ndoctors and scientists made another startling discovery: the mosquitoes themselves were\nalso infected and not mere carriers. Every year, during the mosquito season, malarial blood\nwas moved around the population by the insects. Definitive proof of these new theories\nwas obtained after an extraordinary series of experiments in Italy, where healthy people\nwere introduced into malarial zones but kept free of mosquito bites – and remained well.\nThe new Italian state had the necessary information to tackle the disease.\n \n1\n\nD\nA complicated approach was adopted, which made use of quinine – a drug obtained from\ntree bark which had long been used to combat fever but was now seen as a crucial part of\nthe war on malaria. Italy introduced a quinine law and a quinine tax in 1904, and the drug\nwas administered to large numbers of rural workers. Despite its often terrible side-effects\n(the headaches produced were known as the “quinine-buzz”), the drug was successful in\nlimiting the spread of the disease, and in breaking cycles of infection. In addition, Italy set\nup rural health centres and invested heavily in education programmes. Malaria, as\nSnowden shows, was not just a medical problem, but a social and regional issue, and\ncould only be defeated through multi-layered strategies. Politics was itself transformed by\nthe anti-malarial campaigns.\nE\nIt was originally decided to give quinine to all those in certain regions – even healthy\npeople; peasants were often suspicious of the medicine being forced upon them. Doctors\nwere sometimes met with hostility and refusal, and many were dubbed “poisoners”. Despite\nthese problems, the strategy was hugely successful. Deaths from malaria fell by some 80%\nin the first decade of the 20th century and some areas escaped altogether from the\nscourge of the disease.\nF\nShamefully, the Italian malaria expert Alberto Missiroli had a role to play in the disaster: he\ndid not distribute quinine, despite being well aware of the epidemic to come. Snowden\nclaims that Missiroli was already preparing a new strategy – with the support of the US\nRockefeller Foundation – using a new pesticide, DDT. Missiroli allowed the epidemic to\nspread, in order to create the ideal conditions for a massive, and lucrative, human\nexperiment. Fifty-five thousand cases of malaria were recorded in the province of Littoria\nalone in 1944. It is estimated that more than a bird of those in the affected area contracted\nthe disease. Thousands, nobody knows how many, died.\nG\nWith the war over, the US government and the Rockefeller Foundation were free to\nexperiment. DDT was sprayed from the air and 3m Italians had their bodies covered with\nthe chemical. The effects were dramatic, and nobody really cared about the toxic effects of\nthe chemical. By 1962, malaria was more or less gone from the whole peninsula. The last\ncases were noted in a poor region of Sicily. One of the final victims to die of the disease in\nItaly was the popular cyclist, Fausto Coppi. He had contracted malaria in Africa in 1960,\nand the failure of doctors in the north of Italy to spot the disease was a sign of the times. A\nfew decades earlier, they would have immediately noticed the tell-tale signs; it was later\nclaimed that a small dose of quinine would have saved his life.\nH\nAs there are still more than 1m deaths every year from malaria worldwide, Snowden’s book\nalso has contemporary relevance. This is a disease that affects every level of the societies\nwhere it is rampant. As Snowden writes: “In Italy, malaria undermined agricultural\nproductivity, decimated the army, destroyed communities and left families impoverished.”\nThe economic miracle of the 50s and 60s which made Italy into a modern industrial nation\n \n2\n\nwould not have been possible without the eradication of malaria. Moreover, this book\nconvincingly argues that the disease was “an integral part of the big picture of modern\nItalian history”. This magnificent study, beautifully written and impeccably documented,\ndeserves an audience beyond specialists in history, or in Italy. It also provides us with “a\nmessage of hope for a world struggling with the great present-day medical emergency”.\n \n3",
