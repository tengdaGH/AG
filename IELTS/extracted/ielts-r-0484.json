  "passage_text": "Reading Practice\n \nThe hidden lives of solitary bees\nThere are 275 different species of bee in Great Britain and Ireland. Apart from the familiar\nhoneybee and 25 species of bumblebee, the rest are known as solitary bees.\nSolitary bees are unlike 'social' honeybees and bumblebees, which live in large colonies\nconsisting of a queen whose function is to lay the eggs, while the workers gather pollen\nand nectar to feed the tiny grubs With solitary bees, there are typically just males and\nfemales. They mate, the mate dies and the female makes a nest.\nIan Beavis is a naturalist and blogger with a mission to raise the profile of the many solitary\nbees, whose pollinating services are so important, yet so little recognised, Solitary bees\ninhabit gardens, parks, woodlands, fields and cliffs. In fact they represent 95% of the\nworld's bee species. Leading wildlife illustrator Richard Lewington. best known for his\nbeautiful paintings of butterflies, says, 'Solitary bees are so useful to gardeners and\ncommercially valuable. Yet until recently they barely registered in the public consciousness.\nI wanted to help publicise their vital role in our lives' The problem with solitary bees has\nlong been one of identification - with more than 240 species to choose from, and no\naccessible guidebook, where do people start? So Richard Lewington has spent any spare\ntime over the past few years working on a new guide to the bees of Great Britain and\nIreland. This, amazingly, is the first book of its kind to be published for over a century.\nHow do solitary bees live? A female solitary bee constructs a nest and then lays her eggs\nin individual cells, lining or sealing them with various materials depending on the species of\nbee - red mason bees use mud leafcutter bees use sections of leaf The female leaves what\nnaturalists call a 'parcel' of pollen and nectar for each other little grubs to feed on When the\nfemale has laid all her eggs, she dies The emerging grubs eat. grow and develop into\nadults the following year.\nWhile some bees are plentiful and widespread, others have been designated as rare. Or\nare very local in distribution. In 2013. Ian Beavis came across what has long been known\nas one of Britain's rarest species, the banded mining bee. An impressive species with white\nhairs on its face, the banded mining bee nests in the ground, typically on steep banks. Ian\nBeavis explains that it always chooses bare earth because it doesn't like having to eat\nthrough plant roots to make its nest Females feed on a variety of plants, but seem\nparticularly fond of yellow dandelions that bloom from spring to autumn.\nAnother bee that has attracted naturalists' attention is the ivy bee. It was only identified as\na distinct species in 1993. It is one of a number of bees that have been able to establish\nthemselves in Britain due to the recent warmer winters. About the same size as a with\ndistinctive orange-yellow banding on its abdomen, it was initially thought to feed on y on\nivy, but has since been seen visiting other plants.\nThe discoveries about ivy bees show how rewarding the study of solitary bees can be but\nit's not the only species whose habits are changing. Ian Beavis believes we can see in\nsolitary bees the beginning of social behaviour. He explains that many species make their\nnests close to each other in huge groups, and there are some, like Andrena scotica, where\nseveral bees use the same entrance without becoming aggressive. It's not difficult to see\nhow this behaviour, which could be seen as the foundation of social behaviour, might\n \n1\n\nevolve in future into worker bees sharing care of the grubs. Indeed some of Britain's\nsolitary bees, Lasioglossum malachurum for example, are already demonstrating this type\nof social behaviour. So will all solitary bees evolve into social insects? Not necessarily.\nAccording to Ian Beavis, there are advantages to social behaviour but there are also\nadvantages to nesting alone. Bees that nest socially are a target for predators, diseases\nand parasites.\nPesticides can also pose a threat to solitary bees. At the University of Sussex in England.\nBeth Nicholls is conducting research into the effects of certain pesticides on the red mason\nbee. She explains. 'We know that pesticides harm social bees, but very little research has\nbeen done into solitary bees.’ Honeybees fly throughout the summer, so they may be\nexposed to different levels of pesticides. But if the shorter flight period of solitary bees - the\nred mason bee only flies from March to May - coincides with peak pesticide levels, that\nmight be disastrous. If the red mason bee declines dramatically, it could affect the fruit\ngrowing industry. According to Beth Nicholls, it is much more efficient at pollinating orchard\ntrees. Social bees carry pollen in ‘baskets' on their back legs, but a female red mason bee\ncarries it on the underside of her abdomen. This is a messier way of transporting it, and so\nmore pollen is transferred to other flowers. The social bees' method is much 'tidier’, so\nonce they have collected the pollen and tucked it away behind their legs, it won't be\ndropped.\nSolitary bees are all around us. We need to start paying attention to them before it’s too\nlate.\n \n2",
