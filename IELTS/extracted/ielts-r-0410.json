  "passage_text": "Reading Practice\n \n \nStress of Workplace\n \nA   How busy is too busy? For some it means having to miss the occasional long lunch; for\nothers it means missing lunch altogether. For a few, it is not being able to take a “sickie”\nonce a month. Then there is a group of people for whom working every evening and\nweekend is normal, and frantic is the tempo of their lives. For most senior executives,\nworkloads swing between extremely busy and frenzied. The vice-president of the\nmanagement consultancy AT Kearney and its head of telecommunications for the Asia-\nPacific region, Neil Plumridge, says his work weeks vary from a “manageable” 45 hours to\n80 hours, but average 60 hours.\n \nB    Three warning signs alert Plumridge about his workload: sleep, scheduling and family.\nHe knows he has too much on when he gets less than six hours of sleep for three\nconsecutive nights; when he is constantly having to reschedule appointments; “and the\nthird one is on the family side”, says Plumridge, the father of a three-year-old daughter, and\nexpecting a second child in October. “If I happen to miss a birthday or anniversary, I know\nthings are out of control.” Being “too busy” is highly subjective. But for any individual, the\nperception of being too busy over a prolonged period can start showing up as stress:\ndisturbed sleep, and declining mental and physical health. National workers’ compensation\nfigures show stress causes the most lost time of any workplace injury. Employees suffering\nstress are off work an average of 16.6 weeks. The effects of stress are also expensive.\nComcare, the Federal Government insurer, reports that in 2003-04, claims for\npsychological injury accounted for 7% of claims but almost 27% of claim costs. Experts say\nthe key to dealing with stress is not to focus on relief – a game of golf or a massage – but\nto reassess workloads. Neil Plumridge says he makes it a priority to work out what has to\nchange; that might mean allocating extra resources to a job, allowing more time or\nchanging expectations. The decision may take several days. He also relies on the advice of\ncolleagues, saying his peers coach each other with business problems. “Just a fresh pair of\neyes over an issue can help,” he says.\n \nC    Executive stress is not confined to big organisations. Vanessa Stoykov has been\nrunning her own advertising and public relations business for seven years, specialising in\nwork for financial and professional services firms. Evolution Media has grown so fast that it\ndebuted on the BRW Fast 100 list of fastest-growing small enterprises last year – just after\nStoykov had her first child. Stoykov thrives on the mental stimulation of running her own\nbusiness. “Like everyone, I have the occasional day when I think my head’s going to blow\noff,” she says. Because of the growth phase the business is in, Stoykov has to concentrate\non short-term stress relief – weekends in the mountains, the occasional “mental health” day\n– rather than delegating more work. She says: “We’re hiring more people, but you need to\ntrain them, teach them about the culture and the clients, so it’s actually more work rather\nthan less.”\nD    Identify the causes: Jan Elsnera, Melbourne psychologist who specialises in executive\ncoaching, says thriving on a demanding workload is typical of senior executives and other\nhigh-potential business people. She says there is no one-size-fits-all approach to stress:\nsome people work best with high-adrenalin periods followed by quieter patches, while\nothers thrive under sustained pressure. “We could take urine and blood hormonal\nmeasures and pass a judgment of whether someone’s physiologically stressed or not,” she\nsays. “But that’s not going to give us an indicator of what their experience of stress is, and\n \n1\n\n \nwhat the emotional and cognitive impacts of stress are going to be.”\n \nE     Eisner’s practice is informed by a movement known as positive psychology, a school\nof thought that argues “positive” experiences – feeling engaged, challenged, and that one\nis making a contribution to something meaningful – do not balance out negative ones such\nas stress; instead, they help people increase their resilience over time. Good stress, or\npositive experiences of being challenged and rewarded, is thus cumulative in the same way\nas bad stress. Elsner says many of the senior business people she coaches are relying\nmore on regulating bad stress through methods such as meditation and yoga. She points to\nresearch showing that meditation can alter the biochemistry of the brain and actually help\npeople “retrain” the way their brains and bodies react to stress. “Meditation and yoga\nenable you to shift the way that your brain reacts, so if you get proficient at it you’re in\ncontrol.”\n \nF    The Australian vice-president of AT Kearney, Neil Plumridge, says: “Often stress is\ncaused by our setting unrealistic expectations of ourselves. I’ll promise a client I’ll do\nsomething tomorrow, and then promise another client the same thing, when I really know\nit’s not going to happen. I’ve put stress on myself when I could have said to the clients:\n‘Why don’t I give that to you in 48 hours?’ The client doesn’t care.” Over-committing is\nsomething people experience as an individual problem. We explain it as the result of\nprocrastination or Parkinson’s law: that work expands to fill the time available. New\nresearch indicates that people may be hard-wired to do it.\nG    A study in the February issue of the Journal of Experimental Psychology shows that\npeople always believe they will be less busy in the future than now. This is a\nmisapprehension, according to the authors of the report, Professor Gal Zauberman, of the\nUniversity of North Carolina, and Professor John Lynch, of Duke University. “On average,\nan individual will be just as busy two weeks or a month from now as he or she is today. But\nthat is not how it appears to be in everyday life,” they wrote. “People often make\ncommitments long in advance that they would never make if the same commitments\nrequired immediate action. That is, they discount future time investments relatively steeply.”\nWhy do we perceive a greater “surplus” of time in the future than in the present? The\nresearchers suggest that people underestimate completion times for tasks stretching into\nthe future, and that they are bad at imagining future competition for their time.\n \n2",
