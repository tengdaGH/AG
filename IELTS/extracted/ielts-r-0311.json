  "passage_text": "Reading Practice\n \nNew Agriculture in Oregon, US\nA\nOnion growers in eastern Oregon are adopting a system that saves water and keeps\ntopsoil in place while producing the highest quality “super-colossal” onions. Pear growers in\nsouthern Oregon have reduced their use of some of the most toxic pesticides by up to two-\nthirds, and are still producing top-quality pear. Range managers throughout the state have\ncontrolled the poisonous weed tansy ragwort with insect predators and saved the Oregon\nlivestock industry up to $4.8 million a year.\nB\nThese are some of the results Oregon growers have achieved in collaboration with Oregon\nState University (OSU) researchers as they test new farming methods including integrated\npest management (IPM). Nationwide, however, IPM has not delivered results comparable\nto those in Oregon. A recent U.S General Accounting Office (GAO) report indicates that\nwhile integrated pest management can result in dramatically reduced pesticide use, the\nfederal government has been lacking in effectively promoting that goal and implementing\nIPM. Farmers also blame the government for not making the new options of pest\nmanagement attractive. “Wholesale changes in the way that farmers control the pests on\ntheir farms is an expensive business.” Tony Brown, of the National Farmers Association,\nsays. “If the farmers are given tax breaks to offset the expenditure, then they would willingly\naccept the new practices.” The report goes on to note that even though the use of the\nriskiest pesticides has declined nationwide, they still make up more than 40 percent of all\npesticides used today; and national pesticide use has risen by 40 million kilograms since\n1992. “Our food supply remains the safest and highest quality on Earth but we continue to\noverdose our farmland with powerful and toxic pesticides and to under-use the safe and\neffective alternatives,” charged Patrick Leahy, who commissioned the report. Green action\ngroups disagree about the safety issue. “There is no way that habitual consumption of\nfoodstuffs grown using toxic chemical of the nature found on today’s farms can be healthy\nfor consumers,” noted Bill Bowler, spokesman for Green Action, one of many lobbyists\ninterested in this issue.\nC\nThe GAO report singles out Oregon’s apple and pear producers who have used the new\nIPM techniques with growing success. Although Oregon is clearly ahead of the nation,\nscientists at OSU are taking the Government Accounting Office criticisms seriously. “We\nmust continue to develop effective alternative practices that will reduce environmental\nhazards and produce high-quality products,” said Paul Jepson, a professor of entomology\nat OSU and new director of\nD\nOSU’s Integrated Plant Protection Centre (IPPC). The IPPC brings together scientists from\nOSU’s Agricultural Experiment Station, OSU Extension service, the U.S. Department of\nAgriculture and Oregon farmers to help develop agricultural systems that will save water\nand soil, and reduce pesticides. In response to the GAO report, the Centre is putting even\nmore emphasis on integrating research and farming practices to improve Oregon\n \n1\n\nagriculture environmentally and economically.\nE\n“The GAO report criticizes agencies for not clearly communicating the goals of IPM,” said\nJepson. “Our challenge is to greatly improve the communication to and from growers, to\nlearn what works and what doesn’t. the work coming from OSU researchers must be\nadopted in the field and not simply languish in scientific journals.”\nF\nIn Oregon, growers and scientists are working together to instigate new practices. For\nexample, a few years ago scientists at OSU’s Malheur Experiment Station began testing a\nnew drip irrigation system to replace old ditches that wasted water and washed soil and\nfertilizer into streams. The new system cut water and fertilizer use by half kept topsoil in\nplace and protected water quality.\nG\nIn addition, the new system produced crops of very large onions, rated “super-colossal”\nand highly valued by the restaurant industry and food processors. Art Pimms, one of the\nresearchers at Malheur comments: “Growers are finding that when they adopt more\nenvironmentally benign practices, they can have excellent results. The new practices\nbenefit the environment and give the growers their success.”\nH\nOSU researcher in Malheur next tested straw mulch and found that it successfully held soil\nin place and kept the ground moist with less irrigation. In addition, and unexpectedly, the\nscientists found that the mulched soil created a home for beneficial beetles and spiders that\nprey on onion thrips – a notorious pest in commercial onion fields – a discovery that could\nreduce the need for pesticides. “I would never have believed that we could replace the\nartificial pest controls that we had before and still keep our good results,” commented Steve\nBlack, a commercial onion farmer in Oregon, “but instead we have actually surpassed\nexpectations.”\nI\nOSU researchers throughout the state have been working to reduce dependence on broad-\nspectrum chemical spays that are toxic to many kinds of organisms, including humans.\n“Consumers are rightly putting more and more pressure on the industry to change its\nreliance on chemical pesticides, but they still want a picture-perfect product,” said Rick\nHilton, an entomologist at OSU’s Southern Oregon Research and Extension Centre, where\nresearches help pear growers reduce the need for highly toxic pesticides. Picture perfect\npears are an important product in Oregon and traditionally they have required lots of\nchemicals. In recent years, the industry has faced stiff competition from overseas\nproducers, so any new methods that growers adopt must make sense economically as well\nas environmentally. Hilton is testing a growth regulator that interferes with the molting of\ncodling moth larvae. Another study used pheromone dispensers to disrupt codling moth\nmating. These and other methods of integrated pest management have allowed pear\ngrowers to reduce their use of organophosphates by two-thirds and reduce all other\nsynthetic pesticides by even more and still produce top-quality pears. These and other\nstudies around the state are part of the effort of the IPPC to find alternative farming\n \n2\n\npractices that benefit both the economy and the environment.\n \n3",
