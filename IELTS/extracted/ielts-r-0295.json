  "passage_text": "Reading Practice\n \nMrs. Carlill and the Carbolic Smoke Ball\nOn 14 January 1892, Queen Victoria’s grandson Prince Albert Victor, second in line to the\nBritish throne, died from flu. He had succumbed to the third and most lethal wave of the\nRussian flu pandemic sweeping the world. The nation was shocked. The people mourned.\nAlbert was relegated to a footnote in history.\nThree days later, London housewife Louisa Carlill went down with flu. She was shocked.\nFor two months, she had inhaled thrice daily from a carbolic smoke ball, a preventive\nmeasure guaranteed to fend off flu - if you believed the advert. Which she did. And why\nshouldn’t she when the Carbolic Smoke Ball Company had promised to cough up £100 for\nany customer who fell ill? Unlike Albert, Louisa recovered, claimed her £100 and set in train\nevents that would win her lasting fame.\nIt started in the spring of 1889. The first reports of a flu epidemic came from Russia. By the\nend of the year, the world was in the grip of the first truly global flu pandemic. The disease\ncame in waves, once a year for the next four years, and each worse than the last.\nWhole cities came to a standstill. London was especially hard-hit. As the flu reached each\nannual peak, normal life stopped. The postal service ground to a halt, trains stopped\nrunning, banks closed. Even courts stopped sitting for lack of judges. At the height of the\nthird wave in 1892, 200 people were buried every day at just one London cemetery. This flu\nwas far more lethal than previous epidemics, and those who recovered were left weak,\ndepressed, and often unfit for work. It was a picture repeated across the continent.\nAccurate figures for the number of the sick and dead were few and far between but Paris,\nBerlin and Vienna all reported a huge upsurge in deaths. The newspapers took an intense\ninterest in the disease, not just because of the scale of it but because of who it attacked.\nMost epidemics carried off the poor and weak, the old and frail. This flu was cutting as\ngreat a swathe through the upper classes, dealing death to the rich and famous, and the\nyoung and fit.\nThe newspaper-reading public was fed a daily diet of celebrity victims. The flu had worked\nits way through the Russian imperial family and invaded the royal palaces of Europe. It\ncarried off the Dowager Empress of Germany and the second son of the king of Italy, as\nwell as England’s future king. Aristocrats and politicians, poets and opera singers, bishops\nand cardinals - none escaped the attentions of the Russian flu.\nThe public grew increasingly fearful. The press might have been overdoing the doom and\ngloom, but their hysterical coverage had exposed one terrible fact.\nThe medical profession had no answer to the disease. This flu, which might ft not even\nhave begun in Russia, was a mystery. What caused it and how did it spread? No one could\nagree on anything.\nBy now, the theory that micro-organisms caused disease was gaining ground, g but no one\nhad identified an organism responsible for flu (and wouldn’t until 1933). In the absence of a\ngerm, many clung to the old idea of bad airs, or miasmas, possibly stirred by some great\nphysical force - earthquakes, perhaps, or electrical phenomena in the upper atmosphere,\neven a passing comet.\n \n1\n\nDoctors advised people to eat well avoiding “unnecessary assemblies”, and if they were\nreally worried, to stuff cotton wool up their nostrils. If they fell ill, they should rest, keep\nwarm and eat a nourishing diet of “milk, eggs and farinaceous puddings”. Alcohol figured\nprominently among the prescriptions: one eminent English doctor suggested champagne,\nalthough he conceded “brandy M in considerable quantities has sometimes been given with\nmanifest advantages”. French doctors prescribed warm alcoholic drinks, arguing that they\nnever saw an alcoholic with flu. Their prescription had immediate results: over a three-day\nperiod, 1,200 of the 1,500 drunks picked up on the streets of Paris claimed they were\nfollowing doctor’s orders.\nSome doctors gave drugs to ease symptoms - quinine for fever, salicin for headache,\nheroin for an “incessant cough”. But nothing in the pharmacy remotely resembled a cure.\nNot surprisingly, people looked elsewhere for help. Hoping to cash in while the pandemic\nlasted, purveyors of patent medicines competed for the public’s custom with ever more\noutrageous advertisements. One of the most successful was the Carbolic Smoke Ball\nCompany.\nThe carbolic smoke ball was a hollow rubber ball, 5 centimetres across, with a nozzle\ncovered by gauze. Inside was a powder treated with carbolic acid, or phenol. The idea was\nto clutch it close to the nose and squeeze gently, inhaling deeply from the emerging cloud\nof pungent powder. This, the company claimed, would disinfect the mucous membranes,\ncuring any condition related to “taking cold”. In the summer of 1890, sales were steady at\n300 smoke balls a month. In January 1891, the figure skyrocketed to 1,500.\nEager to exploit the public’s mounting panic, the Carbolic Smoke Ball Company made\nincreasingly extravagant claims. Oh 13 November 1892, its latest advert in the Pall Mall\nGazette caught the eye of south London housewife Louisa Carlill. “Carbolic Smoke Ball,” it\ndeclared, “will positively cure colds, coughs, asthma, bronchitis, hoarseness, influenza,\ncroup, whooping cough ...”. And the list went on. But it was the next part Mrs. Carlill found\ncompelling. “A £100 reward will be paid by the Carbolic Smoke Ball Company to any\nperson who contracts the increasing epidemic influenza, colds or any disease caused by\ntaking cold, after having used the carbolic smoke ball according to the printed directions\nsupplied with each ball. £1,000 is deposited with the Alliance bank, Regent Street, showing\nour sincerity in the matter.”\nMrs. Carlill hurried off to buy a smoke ball, price 10 shillings. After carefully reading the\ninstructions, she diligently dosed herself thrice daily until 17 January - when she fell ill.\nOn 20 January, Louisa’s husband wrote to the Carbolic Smoke Ball Company.\nUnfortunately for them, Mr. Carlill happened to be a solicitor. His wife, he wrote, had seen\ntheir advert and bought a smoke ball on the strength of it. She had followed the instructions\nto the letter, and yet now - as their doctor could confirm - she had flu.\nThere was no reply. But £100 was not a sum to be sneezed at. Mr. Carlill persisted. The\ncompany resisted. Louisa recovered and sued. In June, Mr. Justice Hawkins found in Mrs.\nCarlill’s favour. The company’s main defence was that adverts were mere “puffery” and\nonly an idiot would believe such extravagant claims. Judge Hawkins pointed out that\nadverts were not aimed at the wise and thoughtful, but at the credulous and weak. A\nvendor who made a promise “must not be surprised if occasionally he is held to his\npromise”.\nCarbolic appealed. In December, three lord justices considered the case. Carbolic’s\n \n2\n\nlawyers tried several lines of defence. But in the end, the case came down to a single\nmatter: not whether the remedy was useless, or whether Carbolic had committed fraud, but\nwhether its advert constituted a contract - which the company had broken. A contract\nrequired agreement between two parties, argued Carbolic’s lawyers. What agreement had\nMrs. Carlill made with them?\nThere were times, the judges decided, when a contract could be one-sided. The advert had\nmade a very specific offer to purchasers: protection from flu or £100. By using the smoke\nball as instructed, Mrs. Carlill had accepted that offer. The company might just have\nwriggled out of if if it hadn’t added the bit about the £1,000 deposit. That, said the judges,\ngave buyers reason to believe Carbolic meant what it said. “It seems to me that if a person\nchooses to make extravagant promises of this kind, he probably does so because it pays\nhim to make them, and, if he has made them, the extravagance of the promises is no\nreason in law why he should not be bound by them,” pronounced Lord Justice Bowen.\nLouisa got her £100. The case established the principle of the unilateral contract and is\nfrequently cited today.\n \n3",
