  "passage_text": "Reading Practice\n \nBuy Nothing Day\n“Buy Nothing Day” began in the 1990s in Vancouver, Canada. It was the idea of a man\nnamed Kalle Lasn and his organization Adbusters. Before starting Adbusters, Lasn worked\nfor many years in advertising. He helped companies research what influenced people to\nbuy things. But Lasn began to question the ways advertisers influenced people to buy\nthings. He also questioned the culture of buying. Was it good to make people feel like they\nshould always want more and more? “Buy Nothing Day” criticizes this culture of\nconsumerism.\nLasn recognizes that people need to consume things. They have to buys things to eat, live\nand even enjoy life. But Lasn believes that many companies encourage people to consume\nfar more than is necessary. Advertising this way helps companies make money. But Lasn\nbelieves it hurts people and culture.\nSo Lasn decided to use advertising against companies. Adbusters tries to help people\nunderstand some of the false values and ideas behind advertising. The main value\nAdbusters fights is the idea, \"You must consume more to be happy.\" And one way they do\nthis is by encouraging people to celebrate “Buy Nothing Day!”\n“Buy Nothing Day” is celebrated on the fourth Friday of every November. Adbusters chose\nthis day for a very important reason. It is the biggest buying day of the year. Advertisers call\nthis day Black Friday.\nBlack Friday is particularly famous in the United States. It is the day after the country’s\nThanksgiving holiday. On Thanksgiving, people in the United States gather with family and\nfriends to eat a meal and give thanks. In recent years, stores began to reduce their prices\nthe day after Thanksgiving. They wanted to encourage people to start buying gifts for the\nChristmas holiday in December.\nHowever, in recent years, Black Friday has become famous for something else: greed and\nviolence. On Black Friday stores offer extremely reduced prices. But they only offer limited\namounts of product. So, people come early in the morning - or even the night before - to\nstand in lines outside stores. Sometimes, people push or fight to be first into the store.\nSome people have even died in Black Friday riots!\n“Buy Nothing Day” hopes to end the greed and violence of Black Friday. But its message is\nbigger than just Black Friday. “Buy Nothing Day” is for people in the United States and\naround the world. Many other countries also have growing problems with too much\nconsumption. Sixty-two different countries, from Germany to Japan, already celebrate “Buy\nNothing Day”. And the message is the same everywhere - buying too much hurts people,\nculture and the planet. \nBuy Nothing Day is a simple idea. It fights consumer culture by asking us to stop buying for\na day. Anyone can do it if they spend a day without buying. For some people, “Buy Nothing\nDay” is a protest. For other people, it is a party. Some groups go to stores and encourage\nother people not to buy things. Other people gather together to make Christmas gifts -\ninstead of buying them. And some people use the day to create works of art that protest\nagainst consumer messages. Often, people celebrate by enjoying the free gift of nature.\nThey go for walks, or watch the sun set together. The only rule of “Buy Nothing Day” is not\n \n1\n\nto buy anything!\nSome people question if “Buy Nothing Day” can really change culture. It is only one day.\nAnd telling people not to do something often does not work! Other people say that\nconsumers should not just buy less, but they should buy better. These people encourage\nconsumers to buy things that are made in ways that do not hurt people or the environment.\nBut “Buy Nothing Day” does get people thinking about the negative effects of buying too\nmuch. A lot of people have had deep learning experiences when they tried celebrating “Buy\nNothing Day”. It was like giving up an addiction to drugs.\n \n \n \nBuying more and more things can be like an addiction. Often, the more people buy things,\nthe more things they want. People are happier and more satisfied when they spend money\non experiences instead of things. Satisfaction over purchases decreases over time. A new\ncar does not stay new for very long. But a satisfying experience often becomes more\npositive over time as we remember it.\n \n2",
