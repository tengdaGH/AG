  "passage_text": "Reading Practice\n \n \nGifted children and learning\n \nA  Internationally, ‘giftedness’ is most frequently determined by a score on a general\nintelligence test, known as an IQ test, which is above a chosen cutoff point, usually at\naround the top 2-5%. Children’s educational environment contributes to the IQ score and\nthe way intelligence is used. For example, a very close positive relationship was found\nwhen children’s IQ scores were compared with their home educational provision (Freeman,\n2010). The higher the children’s IQ scores, especially over IQ 130, the better the quality of\ntheir educational backup, measured in terms of reported verbal interactions with parents,\nnumber of books and activities in their home etc. Because IQ tests are decidedly influenced\nby what the child has learned, they are to some extent measures of current achievement\nbased on age-norms; that is, how well the children have learned to manipulate their\nknowledge and know-how within the terms of the test. The vocabulary aspect, for example,\nis dependent on having heard those words. But IQ tests can neither identify the processes\nof learning and thinking nor predict creativity.\n \nB  Excellence does not emerge without appropriate help. To reach an exceptionally high\nstandard in any area very able children need the means to learn, which includes material to\nwork with and focused challenging tuition -and the encouragement to follow their dream.\nThere appears to be a qualitative difference in the way the intellectually highly able think,\ncompared with more average-ability or older pupils, for whom external regulation by the\nteacher often compensates for lack of internal regulation. To be at their most effective in\ntheir self-regulation, all children can be helped to identify their own ways of learning –\nmetacognition – which will include strategies of planning, monitoring, evaluation, and\nchoice of what to learn. Emotional awareness is also part of metacognition, so children\nshould be helped to be aware of their feelings around the area to be learned, feelings of\ncuriosity or confidence, for example.\n \nC High achievers have been found to use self-regulatory learning strategies more often and\nmore effectively than lower achievers, and are better able to transfer these strategies to\ndeal with unfamiliar tasks. This happens to such a high degree in some children that they\nappear to be demonstrating talent in particular areas. Overviewing research on the thinking\nprocess of highly able\nchildren, (Shore and Kanevsky, 1993) put the instructor’s problem succinctly: ‘If they [the\ngifted] merely think more quickly, then .we need only teach more quickly. If they merely\nmake fewer errors, then we can shorten the practice’. But of course, this is not entirely the\ncase; adjustments have to be made in methods of learning and teaching, to take account of\nthe many ways individuals think.\nD Yet in order to learn by themselves, the gifted do need some support from their teachers.\nConversely, teachers who have a tendency to ‘overdirect’ can diminish their gifted pupils’\nlearning autonomy. Although ‘spoon-feeding’ can produce extremely high examination\nresults, these are not always followed by equally impressive life successes. Too much\ndependence on the teachers risks loss of autonomy and motivation to discover. However,\nwhen teachers o pupils to reflect on their own learning and thinking activities, they increase\ntheir pupils’ self-regulation. For a young child, it may be just the simple question ‘What\nhave you learned today?’ which helps them to recognise what they are doing. Given that a\nfundamental goal of education is to transfer the control of learning from teachers to pupils,\nimproving pupils’ learning to learn techniques should be a major outcome of the school\n \n1\n\n \nexperience, especially for the highly competent. There are quite a number of new methods\nwhich can help, such as child- initiated learning, ability-peer tutoring, etc. Such practices\nhave been found to be particularly useful for bright children from deprived areas.\n \nE  But scientific progress is not all theoretical, knowledge is a so vital to outstanding\nperformance: individuals who know a great deal about a specific domain will achieve at a\nhigher level than those who do not (Elshout, 1995). Research with creative scientists by\nSimonton (1988) brought him to the conclusion that above a certain high level,\ncharacteristics such as independence seemed to contribute more to reaching the highest\nlevels of expertise than intellectual skills, due to the great demands of effort and time\nneeded for learning and practice. Creativity in all forms can be seen as expertise se mixed\nwith a high level of motivation (Weisberg, 1993).\nF To sum up, learning is affected by emotions of both the individual and significant others.\nPositive emotions facilitate the creative aspects of earning and negative emotions inhibit it.\nFear, for example, can limit the development of curiosity, which is a strong force in\nscientific advance, because it motivates problem-solving behaviour. In Boekaerts’ (1991)\nreview of emotion the learning of very high IQ and highly achieving children, she found\nemotional forces in harness. They were not only curious, but often had a strong desire to\ncontrol their environment, improve their learning efficiency and increase their own learning\nresources.\n \n2",
