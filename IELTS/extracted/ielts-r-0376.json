That\ncompulsion has culminated in robotics - the science of conferring various human\ncapabilities on machines.\nA The modern world is increasingly populated by quasi-intelligent gizmos whose\npresence we barely notice but whose creeping ubiquity has removed much human\ndrudgery. Our factories hum to the rhythm of robot assembly arms. Our banking is done at\nautomated teller terminals that thank us with rote politeness for the transaction. Our\nsubway trains are controlled by tireless robo- drivers. Our mine shafts are dug by\nautomated moles, and our nuclear accidents - such as those at Three Mile Island and\nChernobyl - are cleaned up by robotic muckers fit to withstand radiation.\n \nSuch is the scope of uses envisioned by Karel Capek, the Czech playwright who coined the\nterm ‘robot’ in 1920 (the word ‘robota’ means ‘forced labor’ in Czech). As progress\naccelerates, the experimental becomes the exploitable at record pace.\n \nB Other innovations promise to extend the abilities of human operators. Thanks to\nthe incessant miniaturisation of electronics and micromechanics, there are already\nrobot systems that can perform some kinds of brain and bone surgery with\nsubmillimeter accuracy - far greater precision than highly skilled physicians can\nachieve with their hands alone. At the same time, techniques of long-distance\ncontrol will keep people even farther from hazard. In 1994 a ten- foot-tall NASA\nrobotic explorer called Dante, with video-camera eyes and with spiderlike legs,\nscrambled over the menacing rim of an Alaskan volcano while technicians 2,000\nmiles away in California watched the scene by satellite and controlled Dante’s\ndescent.\n \nC But if robots are to reach the next stage of labour-saving utility, they will have to\noperate with less human supervision and be able to make at least a few decisions for\nthemselves - goals that pose a formidable challenge. ‘While we know how to tell a\nrobot to handle a specific error,’ says one expert, ‘we can’t yet give a robot enough\ncommon sense to reliably interact with a dynamic world.’ Indeed the quest for true\nartificial intelligence (Al) has produced very mixed results. Despite a spasm of initial\noptimism in the 1960s and 1970s, when it appeared that transistor circuits and\nmicroprocessors might be able to perform in the same way as the human brain by\nthe 21st century, researchers lately have extended their forecasts by decades if not\ncenturies.\nD What they found, in attempting to model thought, is that the human brain’s roughly one\nhundred billion neurons are much more talented - and human perception far more\ncomplicated - than previously imagined. They have built robots that can recognise the\nmisalignment of a machine panel by a fraction of a millimeter in a controlled factory\nenvironment. But the human mind can glimpse a rapidly changing scene and immediately\ndisregard the 98 per cent that is irrelevant, instantaneously focusing on the woodchuck at\nthe side of a winding forest road or the single suspicious face in a tumultuous crowd. The\nmost advanced computer systems on Earth can’t approach that kind of ability, and\nneuroscientists still don’t know quite how we do it.\n \n1\n\n \n \nE Nonetheless, as information theorists, neuroscientists, and computer experts pool their\ntalents, they are finding ways to get some lifelike intelligence from robots. One method\nrenounces the linear, logical structure of conventional electronic circuits in favour of the\nmessy, ad hoc arrangement of a real brain’s neurons. These ‘neural networks’ do not have\nto be programmed. They can ‘teach’ themselves by a system of feedback signals that\nreinforce electrical pathways that produced correct responses and, conversely, wipe out\nconnections that produced errors. Eventually the net wires itself into a system that can\npronounce certain words or distinguish certain shapes.\n \nF In other areas researchers are struggling to fashion a more natural relationship between\npeople and robots in the expectation that some day machines will take on some tasks now\ndone by humans in, say, nursing homes. This is particularly important in Japan, where the\npercentage of elderly citizens is rapidly increasing. So experiments at the Science\nUniversity of Tokyo have created a ‘face robot’ - a life-size, soft plastic model of a female\nhead with a video camera imbedded in the left eye - as a prototype. The researchers’ goal\nis to create robots that people feel comfortable around. They are concentrating on the face\nbecause they believe facial expressions are the most important way to transfer emotional\nmessages. We read those messages by interpreting expressions to decide whether a\nperson is happy, frightened, angry, or nervous. Thus the Japanese robot is designed to\ndetect emotions in the person it is ‘looking at’ by sensing changes in the spatial\narrangement of the person’s eyes, nose, eyebrows, and mouth. It compares those\nconfigurations with a database of standard facial expressions and guesses the emotion.\nThe robot then uses an ensemble of tiny pressure pads to adjust its plastic face into an\nappropriate emotional response.\nG Other labs are taking a different approach, one that doesn’t try to mimic human\nintelligence or emotions. Just as computer design has moved away from one central\nmainframe in favour of myriad individual workstations - and single processors have been\nreplaced by arrays of smaller units that break a big problem into parts that are solved\nsimultaneously - many experts are now investigating whether swarms of semi-smart robots\ncan generate a collective intelligence that is greater than the sum of its parts.
