Will it be possible for\nnine billion people to have the lifestyle enjoyed today only by the wealthy? One school of\nthought says no: not only should the majority of the world's people resign themselves to\npoverty forever, but rich nations must also revert to simpler lifestyles in order to save the\nplanet.\nAdmittedly, there may be political or social barriers to achieving a rich world. But in fact\nthere seems to be no insuperable physical or ecological reason why nine billion people\nshould not achieve a comfortable lifestyle, using technology only slightly more advanced\nthan that which we now possess. In thinking about the future of civilization, we ought to\nstart by asking w hat people want. The evidence demonstrates that as people get richer\nthey w ant a greater range of personal technology, they want lots of room (preferably near\nor in natural surroundings) and they w ant greater speed in travel. More possessions, more\nspace, more mobility.\nIn the developed world, the personal technologies of the wealthy, including telephones,\nwashing machines and ears, have become necessities within a generation or two.\nIncreasing productivity that results m decreasing costs for such goods has been\nresponsible for the greatest gains in the standard of living, and there is every reason to\nbelieve that this will continue.\nAs affluence grows, the amount of energy and raw- materials used for production of\nmachinery w ill therefore escalate. But this need not mean an end to the machine age.\nRather than being throw n away, materials from old machinery can be recycled by\nmanufacturers. And long before all fossil fuels are exhausted, their rising prices may\ncompel industrial society not only to become more energy efficient but also to find\nalternative energy sources sufficient for the demands of an advanced technological\ncivilization nuclear fission, nuclear fusion, solar energy, chemical photosynthesis,\ngeothermal, biomass or some yet unknown source of energy.\nThe growth of cities and suburbs is often seen as a threat to the environment. However, in\nfact the increasing amount of land consumed by agriculture is a far greater danger than\nurban sprawl. Stopping the growth of farms is the best way to preserve many of the world's\nremaining wild areas. But is a dramatic downsizing of farmland possible? Thanks to the\ngrow th of agricultural productivity, reforestation and ‘re-wilding’ has been under way in the\nindustrial countries for generations. Since 1950 more land in the US has been set aside in\nparks than has been occupied by urban and suburban growth. And much of what was\nfarmland in the nineteenth century is now forest again. Taking the best Iowa maize growers\nas the norm for world food productivity, it has been calculated that less than a tenth of\npresent cropland could support a population of 10 billion.\nIn The Environment Game, a vision of a utopia that would be at once high-tech and\nenvironmentalist. Nigel Calder suggested that ‘nourishing but unpalatable primary food\nproduced by industrial techniques - like yeast from petroleum may be fed to animals, so\n \n1\n\nthat we can continue to eat our customary meat, eggs. milk, butter, and cheese and so that\npeople in underdeveloped countries can have adequate supplies of animal protein for the\nfirst time.'\nIn the long run. tissue-cloning techniques could be used to grow desired portions of meat\nby themselves. Once their DNA has been extracted to create cow less steaks and chicken\nless drumsticks, domesticated species of livestock, bred for millennia to be stupid or to\nhave grotesquely enhanced traits, should be allowed to become extinct, except for a few\nspecimens in zoos. However, game such as wild deer, rabbits and wild ducks w ill be ever\nmore abundant as farms revert to wilderness, so this could supplement the laboratory-\ngrown meat in the diets of tomorrow's affluent.\nWith rising personal incomes come rising expectations of mobility.
