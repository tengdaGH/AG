  "passage_text": "Reading Practice\n \nAnesthesiology\nSince the beginning of time, man has sought natural remedies for pain. Between 40 and 60\nA.D., Greet? physician, Dioscorides traveled with the Roman armies, studying the\nmedicinal properties of plants and minerals. His book, De materia medica, written in five\nvolumes and translated into at least seven languages, was the primary reference source for\nphysicians for over sixteen centuries. The field of anesthesiology1, which was once nothing\nmore than a list of medicinal plants and makeshift remedies, has grown into one of the\nmost important fields in medicine.\n \nMany of the early pain relievers were based on myth and did little to relieve the suffering of\nan ill or injured person. The mandragora (now known as the mandrabe plant) was one of\nthe first plants to be used as an anesthetic1. Due to the apparent screaming that the plant\nmade as it was pulled from the ground, people in the Middle Ages believed that the person\nwho removed the mandrabe from the earth would either die or go insane. This superstition\nmay have resulted because the split root of the mandrabe resembled the human form. In\norder to pull the root from the ground, the plant collector would loosen it and tie the stem to\nan animal. It was believed that the safest time to uproot a mandrabe was in the moonlight,\nand the best animal to use was a black dog. In his manual, Dioscorides suggested boiling\nthe root with wine and having a man drinb the potion to remove sensation before cutting his\nflesh or burning his skin. Opium and Indian hemp were later used to induce sleep before a\npainful procedure or to relieve the pain of an illness. Other remedies such as cocaine did\nmore harm to the patient than good as people died from their addictions. President Ulysses\nS. Grant became addicted to cocaine before he died of throat cancer in 1885.\n \nThe modern field of anesthetics dates to the incident when nitrous oxide (more commonly\nknown as laughing gas) was accidentally discovered. Humphrey Davy, the inventor of the\nminer’s lamp, discovered that inhaling the toxic compound caused a strange euphoria,\nfollowed by fits of laughter, tears, and sometimes unconsciousness. U.S. dentist, Horace\nWells, was the first on record to experiment with laughing gas, which he used in 1844 to\nrelieve pain during a tooth extraction. Two years later. Dr. William Morton created the first\nanesthetic machine. This apparatus was a simple glass globe containing an ether-soaked\nsponge. Morton considered ether a good alternative to nitrous oxide because the numbing\neffect lasted considerably longer. His apparatus allowed the patient to inhale vapors1\nwhenever the pain became unbearable. In 1846, during a trial experiment in Boston, a\ntumor2 was successfully removed from a man's jaw area while he was anesthetized with\nMorton’s machine.\nThe first use of anesthesia in the obstetric field occurred in Scotland by Dr. James\nSimpson. Instead of ether, which he considered irritating to the eyes, Simpson\nadministered chloroform to reduce the pain of childbirth. Simpson sprinkled chloroform on a\nhandkerchief and allowed laboring3 women to inhale the fumes at their own discretion. In\n1853, Queen Victoria agreed to use chloroform during the birth of her eighth child. Soon\nthe use of chloroform during childbirth was both acceptable and fashionable. However, as\nchloroform became a more popular anesthetic, knowledge of its toxicity surfaced, and it\nwas soon obsolete.\nAfter World War II, numerous developments were made in the field of anesthetics. Surgical\nprocedures that had been unthinkable were being performed with little or no pain felt by the\n \n1\n\npatient. Rather than physicians or nurses who administered pain relief as part of their\nprofession, anesthesiologists became specialists in suppressing consciousness and\nalleviating pain. Anesthesiologists today are classified as perioperative physicians,\nmeaning they take care of a patient before, during, and after surgical procedures. It takes\nover eight years of schooling and four years of residency until an anesthesiologist is\nprepared to practice in the United States. These experts are trained to administer three\ndifferent types of anesthetics: general, local, and regional. General anesthetic is used to\nput a patient into a temporary state of unconsciousness. Local anesthetic is used only at\nthe affected site and causes a loss of sensation. Regional anesthetic is used to block the\nsensation and possibly the movement of a larger portion of the body. As u/ell as controlling\nthe levels of pain for the patient before and throughout an operation, anesthesiologists are\nresponsible for monitoring and controlling the patient's vital functions during the procedure\nand assessing the medical needs in the post-operative room.\nThe number of anesthesiologists in the United States has more than doubled since the\n1970s, as has the improvement and success of operative care. In addition, complications\nfrom anesthesiology have declined dramatically. Over 40 million anesthetics are\nadministered in the United States each year, with only 1 in 250,000 causing death.\n \n2",
