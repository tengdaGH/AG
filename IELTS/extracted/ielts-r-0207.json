  "passage_text": "Reading Practice\n \nHow Mobile Telephony Turned into a Health Scare\nThe technology which enabled mobile phones was previously used in the kind of two- way\nradio which could be found in taxis and emergency vehicles. Although this was a great\ndevelopment, it was not really considered mobile telephony because it could not be used to\ndial into existing phone networks. It was known as simplex technology, operating on the\nsame principles as a walkie-talkie, which required that a user press a button, meaning that\nonly one person at a time could talk. Simplex meant that there was only one\ncommunication frequency in use at any one time.\nThe first mobile phones to connect to telephone networks were often installed in cars\nbefore the hand-held version came on the market and the revolution in mobile technology\nbegan. The first generation of mobile phones (called 1G) were large, heavy and analogue\nand it was not until the invention of the second generation (2G) in the 1990s that digital\nnetworks could be used. The digital element enabled faster signalling. At the same time,\ndevelopments in battery design and energy-saving electronics allowed the phones\nthemselves to become smaller and therefore more truly mobile. The second generation\nallowed for text messaging too, and this began with the first person-to-person text message\nin Finland in 1993, although a machine-generated text message had been successfully\nsent two years earlier.\nNone of this would have been possible without the development of duplex technology to\nreplace the relatively primitive simplex technology of the first phase of mobile\ncommunication. In duplex technology, there are two frequencies available simultaneously.\nThese two frequencies can be obtained by the principle of Frequency Division Duplex\n(FDD). To send two signals wirelessly, it is necessary to create a paired spectrum, where\none band carries the uplink (from phone to antenna) and the other carries the downlink\n(from antenna to phone).Time Division Duplex (TDD) can achieve the same thing, but\ninstead of splitting the frequency, the uplink and downlink are switched very rapidly, giving\nthe impression that one frequency is used.\nFor mobile telephony to work to its fullest potential, it needs to have a network through\nwhich it can relay signals.This network depends on base stations which send and receive\nthe signals. The base stations tend to be simple constructions, or masts, on top of which\nare mounted the antennas. With the rapid increase in demand for mobile services, the\ninfrastructure of antennas in the United Kingdom is now huge.\nMany thousands of reports have appeared claiming that the signals relayed by these\nantennas are harmful to human and animal health. The claims focus on the fact that the\nantennas are transmitting radio waves in microwave form. In some ways, public demand is\nresponsible for the increase in the alleged threat to health. Until quite recently, voice and\ntext messages were transmitted using 2G technology. A 2G mast can send a low-\nfrequency microwave signal approximately 35 kilometres.Third generation (3G) technology\nallows users to wirelessly download information from the internet and is extremely popular.\nThe difference is that 3G technology uses a higher frequency to carry the signals, allowing\nmasts to emit more radiation. This problem Is intensified by the need to have masts in\ncloser proximity to each other and to the handsets themselves. Whatever danger there was\nin 2G signals is greatly multiplied by the fact that the 3G masts are physically much closer\nto people.\n \n1\n\nGovernment authorities have so far refused to accept that there is a danger to public\nhealth, and tests carried out by governments and telecommunications companies have\nbeen restricted to testing to see if heat is being produced from these microwaves.\nAccording to many, however, the problem is not heat, but electromagnetic waves which are\nfound near the masts.\nIt is believed that some people, though not all, have a condition known as electro-\nsensitivity or electro-hypersensitivity (EHS), meaning that the electromagnetism makes\nthem ill in some way.The actual health threat from these pulsed microwave signals is an\narea which greatly needs more research. It has been claimed that the signals affect all\nliving organisms, including plants, at a cellular level and cause symptoms in people ranging\nfrom tiredness and headaches to cancer.
