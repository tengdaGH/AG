  "passage_text": "Reading Practice\n \n \nChange in business organisations\n \nA The forces that operate to bring about change in organisations can be thought of\nas winds which are many and varied - from small summer breezes that merely\ndisturb a few papers, to mighty howling gales which cause devastation to structures\nand operations, causing consequent reorientation of purpose and rebuilding.\nSometimes, however, the winds die down to give periods of relative calm, periods of\nrelative organisational stability. Such a period was the agricultural age, which\nGoodman (1995) maintains prevailed in Europe and western societies as a whole\nuntil the early 1700s. During this period, wealth was created in the context of an\nagriculturally based society influenced mainly by local markets (both customer and\nlabour) and factors outside people’s control, such as the weather. During this time,\npeople could fairly well predict the cycle of activities required to maintain life, even if\nthat life might be at little more than subsistence level.\n \nB To maintain the meteorological metaphor, stronger winds of change blew to bring\nin the Industrial Revolution and the industrial age. Again, according to Goodman,\nthis lasted for a long time, until around 1945. It was characterised by a series of\ninventions and innovations that reduced the number of people needed to work the\nland and, in turn, provided the means of production of hitherto rarely obtainable\ngoods; for organisations, supplying these in ever increasing numbers became the\naim. To a large extent, demand and supply were predictable, enabling . companies to\nstructure their organisations along what Burns and Stalker (1966) described as\nmechanistic lines, that is as systems of strict hierarchical structures and firm means\nof control.\n \nC This situation prevailed for some time, with demand still coming mainly from the\ndomestic market and organisations striving to fill the ‘supply gap’. Thus the most\ndisturbing environmental influence on organisations of this time was the demand for\nproducts, which outstripped supply. The saying attributed to Henry Ford that ‘You\ncan have any colour of car so long as it is black’, gives a flavour of the supply-led\nstate of the market. Apart from any technical difficulties of producing different\ncolours of car, Ford did not have to worry about customers’ colour preferences: he\ncould sell all that he made. Organisations of this period can be regarded as ‘task-\noriented’, with effort being put into increasing production through more effective\nand efficient production processes.\n \nD As time passed, this favourable period for organisations began to decline. In the\nneo-industrial age, people became more discriminating in the goods and services\nthey wished to buy and, as technological advancements brought about increased\nproductivity, supply overtook demand. Companies began, increasingly, to look\nabroad for additional markets.\nE At the same time, organisations faced more intensive competition from abroad for\ntheir own products and services. In the West, this development was accompanied by\na shift in focus from manufacturing to service, whether this merely added value to\nmanufactured products, or whether it was service in-its own right. In the neo-\nindustrial age of western countries, the emphasis moved towards adding value to\ngoods and services - what Goodman calls the value-oriented time, as contrasted\n \n1\n\n \nwith the task- oriented and products/services-oriented times of the past.\n \nF Today, in the post-industrial age, most people agree that organisational life is\nbecoming ever more uncertain, as the pace of change quickens and the future\nbecomes less predictable. Writing in 1999, Nadler and Tushman, two US academics,\nsaid: ‘Poised on the eve of the next century, we are witnessing a profound\ntransformation in the very nature of our business organisations. Historic forces have\nconverged to fundamentally reshape the scope, strategies, and structures of large\nenterprises.’ At a less general level of analysis, Graeme Leach, Chief Economist at\nthe British Institute of Directors, claimed in the Guardian newspaper (2000) that: ‘By\n2020, the nine-to-five rat race will be extinct and present levels of self-employment,\ncommuting and technology use, as well as age and sex gaps, will have changed\nbeyond recognition.’ According to the article, Leach anticipates that: ‘In 20 years\ntime, 20-25 percent of the workforce will be temporary workers and many more will\nbe flexible, ... 25 percent of people will no longer work in a traditional office and ... 50\npercent will work from home in some form.’ Continuing to use the ‘winds of change’\nmetaphor, the expectation's of damaging gale-force winds bringing the need for rebuilding\nthat takes the opportunity to incorporate new ideas and ways of doing things.\nG Whether all this will happen is arguable. Forecasting the future is always fraught\nwith difficulties. For instance, Mannermann (1998) sees future studies as part art and\npart science and notes: ‘The future is full of surprises, uncertainty, trends and trend\nbreaks, irrationality and rationality, and it is changing and escaping from our hands\nas time goes by. It is also the result of actions made by innumerable more or less\npowerful forces.’ What seems certain is that the organisational world is changing at\na fast rate - even if the direction of change is not always predictable. Consequently,\nit is crucial that organisational managers and decision makers are aware of, and able\nto analyse the factors which trigger organisational change.\n \n2",
