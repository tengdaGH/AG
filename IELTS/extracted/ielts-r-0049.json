  "passage_text": "Reading Practice\n \nAustralian culture and culture shock\n \nSometimes work, study or an sense of adventure take us out of our familiar surroundings to\ngo and live in a different culture. The experience can be difficult, even shocking.\nAlmost everyone who studies, lives or works abroad has problems adjusting to a new\nculture. This response is commonly referred to as 'culture shock'. Culture shock can be\ndefined as 'the physical and emotional discomfort a person experiences when entering a\nculture different from their own' (Weaver, 1993).\nFor people moving to Australia, Price (2001) has identified certain values which may give\nrise to culture shock. Firstly, he argues that Australians place a high value on\nindependence and personal choice. This means that a teacher or course tutor will not tell\nstudents what to do, but will give them a number of options and suggest they work out\nwhich one is the best in their circumstances. It also means that they are expected to take\naction if something goes wrong and seek out resources and support for themselves.\nAustralians are also prepared to accept a range of opinions rather than believing there is\none truth. This means that in an educational setting, students will be expected to form their\nown opinions and defend the reasons for that point of view and the evidence for it.\nPrice also comments that Australians are uncomfortable with differences in status and\nhence idealise the idea of treating everyone equally. An illustration of this is that most adult\nAustralians call each other by their first names. This concern with equality means that\nAustralians are uncomfortable taking anything too seriously and are even ready to joke\nabout themselves.\nAustralians believe that life should have a balance between work and leisure time. As a\nconsequence, some students may be critical of others who they perceive as doing nothing\nbut study.\n \n \nAustralian notions of privacy mean that areas such as financial matters, appearance and\nrelationships are only discussed with close friends. While people may volunteer such\ninformation, they may resent someone actually asking them unless the friendship is firmly\nestablished. Even then, it is considered very impolite to ask someone what they earn. With\nolder people, it is also rude to ask how old they are, why they are not married or why they\ndo not have children. It is also impolite to ask people how much they have paid for\nsomething, unless there is a very good reason for asking.\n \n \nKohls (1996) describes culture shock as a process of change marked by four basic stages.\nDuring the first stage, the new arrival is excited to be in a new place, so this is often\nreferred to as the \"honeymoon\" stage. Like a tourist, they are intrigued by all the new\nsights and sounds, new smells and tastes of their surroundings. They may have some\nproblems, but usually they accept them as just part of the novelty. At this point, it is the\nsimilarities that stand out, and it seems to the newcomer that people everywhere and their\nway of life are very much alike. This period of euphoria may last from a couple of weeks to\na month, but the letdown is inevitable.\nDuring the second stage, known as the 'rejection' stage, the newcomer starts to\nexperience difficulties due to the differences between the new culture and the way they\nwere accustomed to living. The initial enthusiasm turns into irritation, frustration, anger and\n \n1\n\n \n \ndepression, and these feelings may have the effect of people rejecting the new culture so\nthat they notice only the things that cause them trouble, which they then complain about. In\naddition, they may feel homesick, bored, withdrawn and irritable during this period as well.\n \n \nFortunately, most people gradually learn to adapt to the new culture and move on to the\nthird stage, known as 'adjustment and reorientation'. During this stage a transition\noccurs to a new optimistic attitude. As the newcomer begins to understand more of the new\nculture, they are able to interpret some of the subtle cultural clues which passed by\nunnoticed earlier. Now things make more sense and the culture seems more familiar. As a\nresult, they begin to develop problem-solving skills, and feelings of disorientation and\nanxiety no longer affect them.\nIn Kohls's model, in the fourth stage, newcomers undergo a process of adaptation. They\nhave settled into the new culture, and this results in a feeling of direction and self-\nconfidence. They have accepted the new food, drinks, habits and customs and may even\nfind themselves enjoying some of the very customs that bothered them so much previously.\nIn addition, they realise that the new culture has good and bad things to offer and that no\nway is really better than another, just different.\n \n2",
