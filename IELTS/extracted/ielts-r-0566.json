They are representative of\nancient life forms Tuatara are the only living representatives of an ancient lineage of\nreptiles called Sphenodontia, which is over 250 million years old. Because tuatara still look\nlike fossils of reptiles that lived during the age of dinosaurs, they are often called living\nfossils. Now just two species of tuatara survive, and only in New Zealand. One is the\nBrothers Island tuatara which, until recent re-introductions to sanctuaries (safe places for\nwildlife), only survived on North Brother Island. The other species is the common tuatara,\nwhich survives on many other offshore islands. Although the tuatara species appear\nsimilar, they have genetic differences. Tuatara bones have been found in many parts of\nNew Zealand. Where dated, they are usually a few hundred to 5,000 years old. It is not\nknown whether these bones are from the two living species or other species that are now\nextinct.\nMany anatomical features distinguish tuatara from other living reptiles - for example, they\nhave a defining pattern of openings in the skull and a unique type of haemoglobin in the\nblood, and males have no external reproductive organ. Adults are between 30 and 75\ncentimetres long, and weigh between 250 and 1.200 grams. Males are larger than females,\nand have more developed spines in the crest along the neck, back and tail.\nThe male tuatara courts the female by approaching her with a proud walk. Tuatara mate in\nlate summer, and the female usually lays 6-10 eggs the following spring, in a shallow nest\nat ground level. She may guard the nest for a few nights, then return to her burrow\nunderground. The eggs incubate for about a year, so hatchlings emerge about the time that\neggs are being laid the following season. Evidence indicates the gender of tuatara\nhatchlings is determined by both genetic and environmental factors. It is said that it is more\nlikely for warmer eggs to produce male tuatara, and cooler eggs to produce females. The\nhatchlings receive no parental care and need to find their own food.\nTuatara live for a relatively long time, reaching reproductive maturity at about 15 years, and\nmay breed for many decades. Their maximum lifespan is not known for certain, but many\ntuatara have reached 80 years still looking vigorous and healthy. Tuatara live in\nunderground burrows and are more active at night, but will come out during the day to bask\nin the sun. Both sexes are territorial, and males aggressively defend their territory by\nposing and fighting if necessary. Teeth are their main weapons, and a bite can cause\nserious injury. Tuatara are carnivorous, eating invertebrates, lizards and the baby seabirds\nwith which they often share burrows.\nTuatara were once widespread and abundant on the New Zealand mainland, but when\nPolynesian settlers arrived in New Zealand, in about 1250-1300 AD, they brought with\nthem Pacific rats which killed tuatara. By the time of European settlement, in the 1840s,\ntuatara were almost extinct on the New Zealand mainland. Some islands provided\ntemporary havens, but soon these too began to be invaded by rats and other mammalian\npredators.\nGradually tuatara became restricted to 32 nearshore islands. Many of these islands were\ntiny, some as small as only one hectare.

The largest population is on Stephens Island, where there are\nestimated to be as many as 2,500 per hectare in some places, and a total of at least\n30,000.
