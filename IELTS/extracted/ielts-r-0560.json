  "passage_text": "Reading Practice\n \nTHE SUN\nImagine a world where the sun never sets. Children can laugh and play in the streets all\nthrough the night. Fishermen enjoy 24 hours of daylight on the open sea. To get any sleep,\npeople must block all the light from their windows.\nNow imagine a world with only darkness. Even in the middle of the day, the sun does not\nshine. The only light comes from the moon and the stars in the black sky. Cars must drive\nwith their lights on all the time. When people awake in the morning, it looks like the middle\nof the night.\nThis is the situation for people who live above the Arctic Circle. The sun clearly influences\ntheir lives. This includes people in northern Russia, Canada, Alaska and Greenland. For\npart of the year they cannot see the sun. And part of the year the sun never disappears.\nBut do you ever think about the sun? All life depends on the power of the sun. Year after\nyear, the sun warms the earth, gives us light, builds life on our planet, and even keeps us\nhealthy.\nWhatever early people thought about the sun, they did not know much about it. But as\npeople began to use science they learned more about the sun. In 1543, Nicholas\nCopernicus demonstrated that the earth travels around the sun. One hundred years later,\nscientists estimated the distance to the sun. And as recently as 1904, a man named Ernest\nRutherford showed how the sun produced such large amounts of heat. These people\ndiscovered that the sun is a star like all the other stars in the sky. However, for our planet, it\nis a very special star.\nThe earth is 150 million kilometers from the sun. Here is one way to imagine this great\ndistance. Imagine that you are standing on the sun. Your friends are on the earth. If they\nturned on a light, it would take eight minutes for you to see it! But this is the perfect\ndistance for the earth to use the sun's heat.\nThe temperature of the sun is around 6,000 degrees Celsius at its surface, and 15 million\ndegrees at its centre! If the earth were any closer, we would burn. But if the earth were any\nfurther away, we would freeze. And yet, the sun is more than a big heater.\nThe sun also helps provide us with fresh air. The sun heats the oceans. Then the water\nheats the air. The changing air temperatures create most of the world's wind. Wind moves\nair to different places so plants can remove carbon dioxide from the air and create oxygen.\nBut the sun also affects plants directly. The sun makes plants grow through the process of\nphotosynthesis. Plants can change light from the sun into energy. They use the energy to\ngrow bigger and stronger. All life on earth depends on plants. Without the sun, we could not\ngrow food for ourselves or for our animals.\nPlants are not the only things who capture the power of the sun. Human can turn sunlight\ninto electricity with solar cells. A solar cell collects the power of the sun and stores it. Then,\nthis power can be used to run anything that uses electricity: cars, computers, or homes.\nBesides all these amazing things, the sun also helps us to do something very simple, but\nneeded. Without the sun, we would not be able to see anything!\n \n1\n\nThe sun also helps people to be healthy and strong. It acts as a natural cleaner for our\nskin. The sun can help kill harmful bacteria that live on our skin. And the sun helps our\nbodies produce vitamin D. People need vitamin D to have strong bones.\nThe sun can also improve our mental health. In places where the sun does not shine,\npeople can suffer from seasonal affective disorder. This is a kind of depression. People\nwith season affective disorder do not have energy and feel sad. They are treated by sitting\nnear a special light. But nothing is as good as being in real sunlight. Sunlight can help\nprevent depression and keep people happy. When the sun is shining, people have more\nhope about the future.\nThe sun does many other things as well. It helps us tell time. It controls the where and\nwhen animals travel. The sun's gravity keeps the planet in orbit. It even lets us see at night.\nThis is because the sun shines on the moon and the moon sends the light down to the\nearth. The sun makes the colors of a rainbow after it rains. And it paints the sky during a\nsunset.\nThere are many things we still do not know about the sun. But the more we learn about the\nsun, the more we can thank God for giving us this wonderful gift.\n \n2",
