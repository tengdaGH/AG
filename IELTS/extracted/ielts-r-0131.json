  "passage_text": "Reading Practice\n \nDevelopment of Public management theory\nBureaucracy management: The classic one\n{A}  Several theories bridged the gap between strictly private and public sector\nmanagement. One good example is Max Weber exploring sociologist, who explored the\nideal bureaucracy in The Protestant ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism. Bureaucratic Theory\nwas developed by a German. Sociologist and political economist Max Weber (1864-1920).\nAccording to him, bureaucracy is the most efficient form of organization. The organization\nhas a well-defined line of authority. It has clear rules and regulations which are strictly\nfollowed. according to Max Weber, there are three types of power in an organization: 1.\nTraditional Power, 2. Charismatic power, and 3. Bureaucratic Power or Legal Power.\nThe Characteristics or Features of Bureaucracy Organisation\n \n{B} Weber admired Bureaucracy for its trustworthiness. The Bureaucracy was constituted\nby a group of professional, ethical public officials. These servants dedicate themselves to\nthe public in return for the security of job tenure among the many advantages of public\nemployment. There is a high degree of division of Labour and specialization as well as a\ndefined Hierarchy of authority. There are well-defined rules and regulations that follow the\nprinciple of Rationality, Objectively, and Consistency. These rules cover all the duties and\nrights of the employees. These rules must be strictly followed. Impersonal relations among\nthe member of the organization. Interpersonal relations are based on positions and not on\npersonalities\n{C} Bureaucracy organization is a very rigid type of organization. Too much emphasis on\nrules and regulations which are rigid and inflexible. It does not give importance to human\nrelations. No importance is also given to informal groups which nowadays play an\nimportant role in all business organizations. Yet, too much importance is given to the\ntechnical qualifications of the employees for promotion and transfers. The dedication and\ncommitment of the employee are not considered. It is suitable\nfor government organizations. It is also suitable for organizations where change is very\nslow. There will be unnecessary delays in decision-making due to formalities and rules. It is\nappropriate for static organizations. There is difficulty in coordination and communication.\n{D} Herbal Simon, Chester Barnard, and Charles Lindblom are among the first of those\nrecognized as early American public administrators. These men ushered in an era during\nwhich the field gained recognition as independent and unique, despite its multidisciplinary\nnature. Simon contributed theoretical separation to discern management, decisions based\non values. since one cannot make completely responsible decisions with public resources\nbased solely on personal values, one must attempt to upon objectively determined facts.\nSimon developed other relevant theories as well. Similar to Lindblom’s subsequently\ndiscussed critique of comprehensive rationality, Simon also taught that a strictly economic\nman, one who maximizes returns or values by making decisions based upon complete\ninformation in unlimited time, is unrealistic. Instead, most public administrators use a\nsufficient amount of information to make a satisfactory decision: they” satisfice.”\n{E} In decision-making, Simon believed that agents face uncertainty about the future and\n \n1\n\n \ncosts in acquiring information in the present. These factors limit the extent to which agents\ncan make a fully rational decision, thus they possess only” bounded rationality” and must\nmake deci9sion by “Satisficing,” or choosing that which might not be optional but which will\nmake them happy enough. ” Rational behavior, in economics, means that individuals\nmaximize their utility function. Under the constraints they face (e.g. their budget constraint,\nlimited choices,…..) in pursuit of their self-interest.\n{F} Chester Barnard was also one of the watershed scholars. Barnard published “The\nEconomy of Incentives”(1938), in an attempt to explain individual participation in an\norganization. Barnard explained organizations as systems of exchange. Low-level\nemployees must have more incentive to remain with the organization for which they\nexchange their labor and loyalty. The organization (and higher-level employees) must\nderive sufficient benefit from its employees to keep them, The net pull of the organization is\ndetermined by material rewards, environmental conditions, and other intangibles like\nrecognition. He gives great importance to persuasion much more than to economic\nincentives. He described four general and four specific incentives including Money and\nother material inducements; Personal non-material opportunities for distinction;\nDESIREABLE PHYSICal conditions of work; Ideal benefactions, such as pride of\nworkmanship, etc.\nA New Humanist Era: Rethinking Power and Management\n{G} Humanists embrace a dynamic concept of employee and management techniques.\nThis requires a theoretical shift away from the idea that an employee is a cog in the\nindustrial machine. Rather, employees are unique individuals with goals, needs desires,\netc.\n \n{H} The humanist era ushered in other possible interpretations of such topics as power and\nmanagement. One of the most significant was Douglas McGregor’s “Theory X and\nTheoryY. ” McGregor’s work provided a basis for a management framework, a structure\nupon whose rungs the classic and new-age management might be hung. first, commonly\nheld by early management theorists, Theory X begins with the assumption that humans\npossess an inherent aversion to work. Employees must therefore be coerced and\ncontrolled if management expects to see results. Further, lazy humans prefer direction\nbordering micromanagement whenever possible.\n{I} Theory Y is much more compatible with the humanist tradition. This begins with the\nassumption that work is as natural for humans as rest or play. Further, employees will\ndirect and control themselves as they complete objectives. Humans learn naturally and\nseek responsibility. Consequently, managers need only to steer employees in a\ncooperative manner toward goals that serve the organization. There is room for many to\ncreate and share power.\n{J} The Z- Organization can be thought of as a complimentary third element to McGregor’s\ndichotomy. Z- organizations are Japanese organizations that are a Japanese\norganizational model. Similar to Theory Y management, Z organizations place a large\ndegree of responsibility upon the employees. Further, relatively low-level employees are\nentrusted with the freedom to be creative, ” wander around the organization” and become\ntruly unique, company-specific employees. However, employees achieve only after\n \n2\n\n“agreeing on a central set of objectives and ways of doing business” In Z Organizations,\ndecision-making is democratic and participatory. Despite the many ADVANTAGES OF\nTHIS ORGANIZATIONAL MODEL, THERE ARE SEVERAL DRAW-BACKS. THESE\nINCLUDE THE DEPREDATION OF A LARGE PROFESSIONAL DIstance-de\npersonalization is impossible in Z-organizations. Since, in reality, there is a high percentage\nof workers who would like to work for the financial return than the job objectives. A high\nlevel of self-discipline is also necessary.\n \n3\n\n \nQUESTIONS 1-2\nChoose Two appropriate letters and fill in boxes 1-2\nWhat are the features and advantages of Bureaucratic Management?\nA There are equal opportunities coming from little hierarchy of authority among companies\nB employees‘ promotion can be much fairer which is based on job duties not on characters\nC employees enjoy a greater freedom of duties than their strict right\nD selection and Promotion is based on mastery of new technology\nE these employees can dedicate themselves to the public for stability of a long term job\nQUESTIONS 3-4\nChoose Two appropriate letters and fill in boxes 3-4\nWhat are the limitations for the ideas of Bureaucratic Management?\nA commitment of the employee is not taken into consideration enough\nB there is difficulty in decision-making based on formalities and rules\nC employees are casually organized as no importance is given to formal groups\nD There is difficulty in enforcement of rules and regulations\nE  it is not applicable to dynamic organizations where change is very fast\nQUESTIONS 5-6\nChoose Two appropriate letters and fill in boxes 5-6\nWhat are the aims of management as Douglas McGregor’s work of the “Theory Y”\nA employees must be coerced and controlled if management expect to see results\nB employees has natural tendency for rest or play\nC humans will not automatically seek responsibility\nD managers may guide employees in a cooperative manner toward objectives\nE there is little room for manager to designate or share his power\nQUESTIONS 7-8\nChoose Two appropriate letters and fill in boxes 7-8\n \n4\n\nWhat are the limitations for the “Theory Z”\nA decision-making is democratic and participatory\nB organization mode has inherent design fault\nC not all employee set higher interest in the job than that of wages\nD personalization remains un-eliminated in organizations\nE self-discipline is an unnecessary quality\nQUESTIONS 9-13\nUse the information in the passage to match the people (listed A-E) with opinions or deeds\nbelow.
