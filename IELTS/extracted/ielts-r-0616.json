  "passage_text": "Reading Practice\n \nWhat Are Dreams ?\nA\nThousands of years ago, dreams were seen as messages from the gods, and in many\ncultures, they are still considered prophetic. In ancient Greece, sick people slept at the\ntemples of Asclepius, the god of medicine, in order to receive dreams that would heal them.\nModern dream science really begins at the end of the 19th century with Sigmund Feud,\nwho theorized that dreams were the expression of unconscious desires often stemming\nfrom childhood. He believed that exploring these hidden emotions through analysis could\nhelp cure mental illness. The Freudian model of psychoanalysis dominated until the 1970s\nwhen new research into the chemistry of the brain showed that emotional problems could\nhave biological or chemical roots, as well as environmental ones. In other words, we\nweren’t sick just because of something our mothers did (or didn’t do), but because of some\nimbalance that might be cured with medication.\nB\nAfter Freud, the most important event in dream science was the discovery in the early\n1950s of a phase of sleep characterized by intense brain activity and rapid eye movement\n(REM). People awakened in the midst of REM sleep reported vivid dreams, which led\nresearchers to conclude that most dreaming took place during REM. Using the\nelectroencephalograph (EEG), researchers could see that brain activity during REM\nresembled that of the waking brain. That old them that a lot more was going on at night\nthan anyone had suspected. But what, exactly?\nC\nScientists still don’t know for sure, although they have lots of theories. On one side are\nscientists like Harvard’s Allan Hobson, who believes that dreams are essentially random. In\nthe 1970s, Hobson and his colleague Robert McCarley proposed what they called the\n“activation-synthesis hypothesis’” which describes how dreams are formed by nerve signals\nsent out during REM sleep from a small area at the base of the brain called the pons.\nThese signals, the researchers said, activate the images that we call dreams. That put a\ncrimp in dream research; if dreams were meaningless nocturnal firings, what was the point\nof studying them?\nD\nAdult humans spend about a quarter of their sleep time in REM, much of it dreaming.\nDuring that time, the body is essentially paralyzed but the brain is buzzing. Scientists using\nPET and fMRI technology to watch the dreaming brain have found that one of the most\nactive areas during REM is the limbic system, which controls our emotions. Much less\nactive is the prefrontal cortex, which is associated with logical thinking. That could explain\nwhy dreams in REM sleep often lack a coherent storyline (some researchers have also\nfound that people dream in non-REM sleep as well, although those dreams generally are\nless vivid.) Another active part of the brain in REM sleep is the anterior cingulate cortex,\nwhich detects discrepancies. Eric Nofzinger, director of the Sleep Neuroimaging Program\nat the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, thinks that could be why people often figure\nout thorny problems in their dreams. “As if the brain surveys the internal milieu and tries to\n \n1\n\nfigure out what it should be doing, and whether our actions conflict with who we are,” he\nsays.\nE\nThese may seem like vital mental functions, but no one has yet been able to say that REM\nsleep or dreaming is essential to life or even sanity. MAO inhibitors, an older class of\nantidepressants, essentially block REM sleep without any detectable effects, although\npeople do get a “REM rebound” – extra REM – if they stop the medication. That’s also true\nof selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) like Prozac, which reduce dreaming by a\nthird to a half. Even permanently losing the ability to dream doesn’t have to be disabling.\nIsraeli researcher Peretz Lavie has been observing a patient named Yuval Chamtzani, who\nwas injured by a fragment of shrapnel that penetrated his brain when he was 19. As a\nresult, he gets no REM sleep and doesn’t remember any dreams. But Lavie says that\nChamtzani, now 55, “is probably the most normal person I know and one of the most\nsuccessful ones.” He’s a lawyer, a painter and the editor of a puzzle column in a popular\nIsraeli newspaper.\nF\nThe mystery of REM sleep is that even though it may not be essential, it is ubiquitous – at\nleast in mammals and birds. But that doesn’t mean all mammals and birds dream (or if they\ndo, they’re certainly not – talking about it). Some researchers think REM may have evolved\nfor physiological reasons. “One thing that’s unique about mammals and birds is that they\nregulate body temperature”, says neuroscientist Jerry Siegel, director of UCLA’s Center for\nSleep Research. “There’s no good evidence that any coldblooded animal has REM sleep.”\nREM sleep heats up the brain and non-REM cools it off, Siegel says, and that could mean\nthat the changing sleep cycles allow the brain to repair itself. “It seems likely that REM\nsleep is filling a basic physiological function and that dreams are a kind of\nepiphenomenon,” Siegel says – an extraneous byproduct; like foam on beer.\nG\nWhatever the function of dreams at night, they clearly can play a role in therapy during the\nday. The University of Maryland’s Clara Hill, who has studied the use of dreams in therapy,\nsays that dreams are a ‘backdoor’, into a patient’s thinking. “Dreams reveal stuff about you\nthat you didn’t know was there,” she says. The therapists she trains to work with patients’\ndreams are, in essence, heirs to Freud, using dream imagery to uncover hidden emotions\nand feelings. Dreams provide clues to the nature of the more serious mental illness.\nSchizophrenics, for example, have poor-quality dreams, usually about objects rather than\npeople. “If you’re going to understand human behavior,” says Rosalind Cartwright, a\nchairman of psychology at Rush University Medical Center in Chicago, “here’s a big piece\nof it. Dreaming is our own storytelling time – to help us know who we are, where we’re\ngoing and how we’re going to get there.” Cartwright has been studying depression in\ndivorced men and women, and she is finding that “good dreamers,” people who have vivid\ndreams with strong storylines, are less likely to remain depressed. She thinks that\ndreaming helps diffuse strong emotions. “Dreaming is a mental-health activity,” she says.\n \n2",
