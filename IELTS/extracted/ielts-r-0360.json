  "passage_text": "Reading Practice\n \nREADING THE SCREEN\nAre the electronic media exacerbating illiteracy and making our children stupid? On the\ncontrary, says Colin McCabe, they have the potential to make us truly literate.\nThe debate surrounding literacy is one of the most charged in education. On the one hand\nthere is an army of people convinced that traditional skills of reading and writing are\ndeclining. On the other, a host of progressives protest that literacy is much more\ncomplicated than a simple technical mastery of reading and writing. This second position is\nsupported by most of the relevant academic work over the past 20 years. These studies\nargue that literacy can only be understood in its social and technical context. In\nRenaissance England, for example, many more people could read than could write, and\nwithin reading there was a distinction between those who could read print and those who\ncould manage the more difficult task of reading manuscript. An understanding of these\nearlier periods helps us understand today’s ‘crisis in literacy’ debate.\nThere does seem to be evidence that there has been an overall decline in some aspects of\nreading and writing - you only need to compare the tabloid newspapers of today with those\nof 50 years ago to see a clear decrease in vocabulary and simplification of syntax. But the\npicture is not uniform and doesn’t readily demonstrate the simple distinction between\nliterate and illiterate which had been considered adequate since the middle of the 19th\ncentury.\nWhile reading a certain amount of writing is as crucial as it has ever been in industrial\nsocieties, it is doubtful whether a fully extended grasp of either is as necessary as it was 30\nor 40 years ago. While print retains much of its authority as a source of topical information,\ntelevision has increasingly usurped this role. The ability to write fluent letters has been\nundermined by the telephone and research suggests that for many people the only use for\nwriting, outside formal education, is the compilation of shopping lists.\nThe decision of some car manufacturers to issue their instructions to mechanics as a video\npack rather than as a handbook might be taken to spell the end of any automatic link\nbetween industrialisation and literacy. On the other hand, it is also the case that ever-\nincreasing numbers of people make their living out of writing, which is better rewarded than\never before. Schools are generally seen as institutions where the book rules - film,\ntelevision and recorded sound have almost no place; but it is not clear that this opposition\nis appropriate. While you may not need to read and write to watch television, you certainly\nneed to be able to read and write in order to make programmes.\nThose who work in the new media are anything but illiterate. The traditional oppositions\nbetween old and new media are inadequate for understanding the world which a young\nchild now encounters. The computer has re-established a central place for the written word\non the screen, which used to be entirely devoted to the image. There is even anecdotal\nevidence that children are mastering reading and writing in order to get on to the Internet.\nThere is no reason why the new and old media cannot be integrated in schools to provide\nthe skills to become economically productive and politically enfranchised.\nNevertheless, there is a crisis in literacy and it would be foolish to ignore it. To understand\nthat literacy may be declining because it is less central to some aspects of everyday life is\nnot the same as acquiescing in this state of affairs. The production of school work with the\n \n1\n\nnew technologies could be a significant stimulus to literacy. How should these new\ntechnologies be introduced into the schools? It isn’t enough to call for computers,\ncamcorders and edit suites in every classroom; unless they are properly integrated into the\neducational culture, they will stand unused. Evidence suggests that this is the fate of most\ninformation technology used in the classroom. Similarly, although media studies are now\npart of the national curriculum, and more and more students are now clamouring to take\nthese course, teachers remain uncertain about both methods and aims in this area.\nThis is not the fault of the teachers. The entertainment and information industries must be\ndrawn into a debate with the educational institutions to determine how best to blend these\nnew technologies into the classroom.\nMany people in our era are drawn to the pessimistic view that the new media are\ndestroying old skills and eroding critical judgement. It may be true that past generations\nwere more literate but - taking the pre-19th century meaning of the term - this was true of\nonly a small section of the population. The word literacy is a 19th-century coinage to\ndescribe the divorce of reading and writing from a full knowledge of literature. The\neducation reforms of the 19th century produced reading and writing as skills separable\nfrom full participation in the cultural heritage.\nThe new media now point not only to a futuristic cyber-economy, they also make our\ncultural past available to the whole nation. Most children’s access to these treasures is\ninitially through television. It is doubtful whether our literary heritage has ever been\navailable to or sought out by more than about 5 per cent of the population; it has certainly\nnot been available to more than 10 per cent. But the new media joined to the old, through\nthe public service tradition of British broadcasting, now makes our literary tradition available\nto all.\n \n2",
