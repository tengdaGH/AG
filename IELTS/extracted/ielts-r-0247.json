  "passage_text": "Reading Practice\nLanguage Strategy in Multinational Company\nA. The importance of language management in multinational companies has never been\ngreater than today. Multinationals are becoming ever more conscious of the importance of\nglobal coordination as a source of competitive advantage and language remains the\nultimate barrier to aspirations of international harmonization. Before attempting to consider\nlanguage management strategies, companies will have to evaluate the magnitude of the\nlanguage barrier confronting them and in doing so they will need to examine it in three\ndimensions: the Language Diversity, the Language Penetration and the\nLanguage Sophistication. Companies next need to turn their attention to how they should\nbest manage language. There is a range of options from which MNCs can formulate their\nlanguage strategy.\nB. Lingua Franca: The simplest answer, though realistic only for English speaking\ncompanies, is to rely on ones native tongue. As recently as 1991 a survey of British\nexporting companies found that over a third used English exclusively in dealings with\nforeign customers. This attitude that —one language fits alll has also been carried through\ninto the Internet age. A survey of the web sites of top American companies confirmed that\nover half made no provision for foreign language access, and another found that less than\n10% of leading companies were able to respond adequately to emails other than in\nthe company‘s language. Widespread though it is however, reliance on a single language\nis a strategy that is fatally flawed. It makes no allowance for the growing trend in Linguistic\nNationalism whereby buyers in Asia, South America and the Middle East in particular are\nasserting their right to —work in the language of the customer!. It also fails to recognize the\nincreasing vitality of languages such as Spanish, Arabic and Chinese that overtime are\nlikely to challenge the dominance of English as a lingua franca. In the IT arena it ignores\nthe rapid globalization of the Internet where the number of English-language ecommerce\ntransactions, emails and web sites, is rapidly diminishing as a percentage of the total.\nFinally, the total reliance on a single language puts the English speaker at risk in\nnegotiations. Contracts, rules and legislation are invariably written in the local language,\nand a company unable to operate in that language is vulnerable.\nC. Functional Multilingualism: Another improvised approach to Language is to rely on what\nhas been termed —Functional Multilingualism!. Essentially what this means is to muddle\nthrough, relying on a mix of languages, pidgins and gestures to communicate by whatever\nmeans the parties have at their disposal. In a social context such a shared effort to make\none another understand might be considered an aid to the bonding process with the\nfrustration of communication being regularly punctuated by moments of absurdity and\nhumor. However, as the basis for business negotiations it appears very hit-and-nuts. And\nyet Hagen‘s recent study suggests that 16% of international business transaction; are\nconducted in a —cocktail of languages.! Functional Multilingualism shares the same\ndefects as reliance on a lingua franca and increases the probability of cognitive divergence\nbetween the parties engaged in the communication.\nD. External Language Resources: A more rational and obvious response to the language\nbarrier is to employ external resources such as translators and interpreters, and certainly\nthere are many excellent companies specialized in these fields. However, such a response\nis by no means an end to the language barrier. For a start these services can be very\nexpensive with a top Simultaneous Interpreter, commanding daily rates as high as a\n \n1\n\npartner in an international consulting company. Secondly, any good translator or interpreter\nwill insist that to be fully effective they must understand the context of the subject\nmatter. This is not always possible. In some cases it is prohibited by the complexity or\nspecialization of the topic. Sometimes by lack of preparation time but most often the\nobstacle is the reluctance of the parties to explain the wider context to an =outsiderll.\nAnother problem is that unless there has been considerable pre-explaining between the\ninterpreter and his clients it is likely that there will be ambiguity and cultural overtones in the\nsource messages the interpreter has to work with. They will of course endeavor to provide\na hifidelity translation but in this circumstance the interpreter has to use initiative and\nguess work. This clearly injects a potential source of misunderstanding into the\nproceedings. Finally while a good interpreter will attempt to convey not only the meaning\nbut also the spirit of any communication, there can be no doubt that there is a loss of\nrhetorical power when communications go through a third party. So in situations requiring\nnegotiation, persuasion, humor etc. the use of an interpreter is a poor substitute for direct\ncommunication.\nE. Training: The immediate and understandable reaction to any skills shortage in a\nbusiness is to consider personnel development and certainly the language training\nindustry is well developed. Offering programs at almost every level and in numerous\nlanguages. However, without doubting the value of language training no company\nshould be deluded into believing this to be assured of success. Training in most\ncompanies is geared to the economic cycle. When times are good, money is\ninvested in training. When belts get tightened training is one of the first —luxuries!\nto be pared down. In a study conducted across four European countries, nearly\ntwice as many companies said they needed language training in coming years as\nhad conducted training in past years. This disparity between —good intentions!\nand —actual delivery!, underlines the problems of relying upon training for language\nskills. Unless the company is totally committed to sustaining the strategy even\nthough bad times, it will fail.\nF. One notable and committed leader in the field of language training has been the\nVolkswagen Group. They have developed a language strategy over many years and\nin many respects can be regarded as a model of how to manage language\nprofessionally. However, the Volkswagen approach underlines that language\ntraining has to be considered a strategic rather than a tactical solution. In their\nsystem to progress from —basics! to —communications competence! in a language\nrequires the completion of 6 language stages each one demanding approximately 90\nhours of refresher course, supported by many more hours of self-study, spread over\na 6-9 month period. The completion of each stage is marked by a post-stage\nachievement test, which is a pre-requisite for continued training. So even this\nprofessionally managed program expects a minimum of three years of fairly\nintensive study to produce an accountant. Engineer, buyer or salesperson capable\nof working effectively in a foreign language. Clearly companies intending to pursue\nthis route need to do so with realistic expectations and with the intention of\nsustaining the program over many years. Except in terms of —brush-up! courses for\npeople who were previously fluent in a foreign language, training cannot be\nconsidered a quick fix and hence other methods will have to be considered.\n \n2",
