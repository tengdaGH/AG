  "passage_text": "Reading Practice\n \nA Wonder Plant\nThe wonder plant with an uncertain future: more than a billion people rely on bamboo for\neither their shelter or income, while many endangered species depend on it for their\nsurvival. Despite its apparent abundance, a new report says that species of bamboo may\nbe under serious threat.\nA\nEvery year, during the rainy season, the mountain gorillas of Central Africa migrate to the\nfoothills and lower slopes of the Virunga Mountains to graze on bamboo. For the 650 0r so\nthat remain in the wild, it’s a vital food source. Although there are at almost 150 types of\nplant, as well as various insects and other invertebrates, bamboo accounts for up t0 90\npercent of their diet at this time of year. Without it, says Ian Redmond, chairman of the Ape\nAlliance, their chances of survival would be reduced significantly. Gorillas aren’t the only\nlocals keen on bamboo. For the people who live close to the Virungas, it’s a valuable and\nversatile raw material used for building houses and making household items such as mats\nand baskets. But in the past 100 years or so, resources have come under increasing\npressure as populations have exploded and large areas of bamboo forest have been\ncleared to make way for farms and commercial plantations.\nB\nSadly, this isn’t an isolated story. All over the world, the ranges of many bamboo species\nappear to be shrinking, endangering the people and animals that depend  upon  them.  But \ndespite  bamboo’s  importance,  we  know surprisingly little about it. A recent report\npublished by the UN Environment Programme (UNEP) and the Inter-national Network for\nBamboo and Rattan (INBAR) has revealed just how profound is our ignorance of global\nbamboo resources, particularly in relation to conservation. There are almost l,600\nrecognized species of bamboo, but the report concentrated on the l,200 or so woody\nvarieties distinguished by the strong stems, or culms, that most people associate with this\nversatile plant. Of these, only 38 ‘priority species’ identified for their commercial value have\nbeen the subject of any real scientific research, and this  has focused mostly on matters\nrelating to their viability as a commodity. This problem isn’t confined to bamboo. Compared\nto the work carried out on animals, the  science  of assessing the conservation status of\nplants is still in its infancy. “People have only started looking hard at this during the past 10-\n15 years, and only now are they getting a handle on how to go about it systematically,”\nsays Dr. Valerie Kapos, one of the report’s authors and a senior adviser in forest ecology\nand conservation to the UNEP.\nC\nBamboo is a type of grass. It comes in a wide variety of forms, ranging in heightfrom 30\ncentimeters to more than 40 meters. It is also the world’s fastest-growing woody plant;\nsome species can grow more than a meterin a day. Bamboo’s ecological rote extends\nbeyond providing food and habitat for animals. Bamboo tends to grow in stands made up of\ngroups of individual plants that grow from root systems known as rhizomes. Its extensive\nrhizome systems, which tie in the top layers of the soil, are crucial in preventing soil\nerosion. And there is growing evidence that bamboo plays an important part in determining\nforest structure and dynamics. “Bamboo’s pattern of mass flowering and mass death\nleaves behind large areas of dry biomass that attract wildfire,” says Kapos. “When these\n \n1\n\nburn, they create patches of open ground within the forest far bigger than would be left by a\nfallen tree.”Patchiness helps to preserve diversity because certain plant species do better\nduring the early stages of regeneration when there are gaps in the canopy.\nD\nHowever, bamboo’s most immediate significance lies in its economic value. Modern\nprocessing techniques mean that it can be used in a variety of ways, for example, as\nflooring and laminates. One of the fastest growing bamboo products  is  paper-25  percent \nof  paper  produced  in  India  is  made  from bamboo fiber, and in Brazil, 100,000 hectares\nof bamboo are grown for its production. Of course, bamboo’s main function has always\nbeen in domestic applications, and as a locally traded commodity it’s worth about\n$4.5billion annually. Because of its versatility, flexibility and strength (its tensile strength\ncompares to that of some steel), it has traditionally been used in construction. Today, more\nthan one billion people worldwide live in bamboo houses. Bamboo is often the only readily\navailable raw material for people in many developing countries, says Chris Stapleton, a\nresearch associate at the Royal Botanic Gardens. “Bamboo can be harvested from forest\nareas or grown quickly elsewhere, and then converted simply without expensive machinery\nor facilities,” he says. “In this way, it contributes substantially to poverty alleviation and\nwealth creation.”\nE\nGiven bamboo’s value in economic and ecological terms, the picture paintedby theUNEP\nreport is all the more worrying. But keen horticulturists will spot an apparent contradiction\nhere. Those who’ve followed the recent vogue for cultivating exotic species in their gardens\nwill point out that if it isn’t kept in check, bamboo can cause real problems. “In a lot of\nplaces, the people who live with bamboo don’t perceive it as being endangered in any\nway,” says Kapos. “In fact, a lot of bamboo species are actually very invasive if they’ve\nbeen introduced.”So why are so many species endangered? There are two separate issues\nhere, says Ray Townsend, vice president of the British Bamboo Society and arboretum\nmanager at the Royal Botanic Gardens. “Some plants are threatened because they can’t\nsurvive in the habitat-they aren’t strong enough or there aren’t enough of them, perhaps.\nBut bamboo can take care of itself-it is strong enough to survive if left alone. What is under\nthreat is its habitat.”It is the physical disturbance that is the threat to bamboo, says Kapos.\n“When forest goes, it is converted into something else: there isn’t anywhere for forest\nplants such as bamboo to grow if you create a cattle pasture.”\nF \nAround the world, bamboo species are routinely protected as part of foresteco-systems in\nnational parks and reserves, but there is next to nothing that protects bamboo in the wild\nfor its own sake. However, some small steps are being taken to address this situation. The\nUNEP-INBAR report will help conservationists to establish effective measures aimed at\nprotecting valuable wild bamboo species. Towns end, too, sees the UNEP report as an\nimportant step forward in promoting the cause of bamboo conservation. “Until now,\nbamboo has been perceived as a second-class plant. When you talk about places such as\nthe Amazon, everyone always thinks about the hardwoods. Of course these are significant,\nbut there is a tendency to overlook the plants they are associated with, which are often\nbamboo species. In many ways, it is the most important plant known to man. I can’t think of\nanother plant that is used so much and is so commercially important in so many\n \n2\n\ncountries.”He believes that the most important first step is to get scientists into the field.\n“We need to go out there, look at these plants and see how they survive and then use that\ninformation to conserve them for the future.”\n \n3",
