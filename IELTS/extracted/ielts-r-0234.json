  "passage_text": "Reading Practice\n \nIs Technology Harming our Children’s Health?\nTechnology is moving at such a breakneck speed that it is enough to make your head spin.\nIt can be difficult to keep up. However, with each new technological marvel come\nconsequences. Much of the research conducted has shown the extent of the damage being\ndone to our health by technology. It is a scary thought, and with teenagers and children\nbeing heavy consumers and users of these gadgets, they run the risk of being harmed the\nmost.\nThe digital revolution in music has enabled people to download, store and listen to songs\non a tiny, portable device called an MP3 player. The process is quick and afterwards you\ncan have access to a library of thousands of songs that can fit into your palm. But experts\nsay that continuously listening to loud music on these small music players can permanently\ndamage hair cells in the inner ear, resulting in hearing loss. Tor instance, old-fashioned\nheadphones have been replaced with smaller ones that fit neatly into the ear, instead of\nover them, which intensifies the sound. In addition to that, digital music does not distort and\nkeeps its crystal clear sound, even on loud settings, which encourages children to crank up\nthe volume. Combine that with the fact that many children will spend hours listening to their\niPods, and you have the recipe for hearing loss. Put into further perspective, most MP3\nplayers can reach levels of 120 decibels, which is louder than a chainsaw or lawnmower.\nWhen you consider 85 decibels is the maximum safe decibel level set by hearing experts\nover the course of a working day, and that children will listen to music at higher decibel\nlevels than that for long periods of time, hearing will invariably suffer.\nApart from hearing damage, there are other serious health risks. We are living in a wireless\nage. Calls can be made and received on mobiles from anywhere and the internet can be\naccessed without the need for cables.The advantages are enormous, bringing ease and\nconvenience to our lives. It is clear that mobiles and wireless technology are here to stay\nbut are we paying the price for new technology? Studies have shown that the rapid\nexpansion in the use of wireless technology has brought with it a new form of radiation\ncalled ‘electropollution’.\nCompared to two generations ago, we are exposed to 100 million times more radiation.\nThe human body consists of trillions of cells which use faint electromagnetic signals to\ncommunicate with each other, so that the necessary biological and physiological changes\ncan happen. It is a delicate, natural balance. But this balance is being upset by the\nconstant exposure to electromagnetic radiation (EMR) that we face in our daily lives and it\nis playing havoc with our bodies. EMR can disrupt and alter the way in which our cells\ncommunicate and this can result in abnormal cell behaviour. Some studies have shown\nthat exposure to wireless technology can affect our enzyme production, immune systems,\nnervous system and even our moods and behaviour. The most dangerous part of the\nphone is around the antenna.This area emits extremely potent radiation which has been\nshown to cause genetic damage and an increase in the risk of cancer.\nResearch shows that teenagers and young adults are the largest group of mobile phone\nusers. According to a recent Eurobarometer survey, 70 per cent of Europeans aged 12-13\nown a mobile phone and the number of children five to nine years old owning mobiles has\ngreatly increased over the years. Children are especially vulnerable because their brains\nand nervous systems are not as immune to attack as adults. Sir William Stewart, chairman\n \n1\n\nof the National Radiological Protection Board, says there is mounting evidence to prove the\nharmful effects of wireless technologies and that families should monitor their children’s\nuse of them.\nBesides the physical and biological damage, technology can also have serious mental\nimplications for children. It can be the cause of severe, addictive behaviour. In one case,\ntwo children had to be admitted into a mental health clinic in Northern Spain because of\ntheir addiction to mobile phones. An average of six hours a day would be spent talking,\ntexting and playing games on their phones. The children could not be separated from their\nphones and showed disturbed behaviour that was making them fail at school. They\nregularly deceived family members to obtain money to buy phone cards to fund their\ndestructive habit. There have been other cases of phone addiction like this.\nTechnology may also be changing our brain patterns. Professor Greenfield, a top specialist\nin brain development, says that, thanks to technology, teenage minds are developing\ndifferently from those of previous generations. Her main concern is over computer games.\nShe claims that living in a virtual world where actions are rewarded without needing to think\nabout the moral implications makes young people’lose awareness of who they are’. She\nclaims that technology brings a decline in linguistic creativity.\nAs technology keeps moving at a rapid pace and everyone clamours for the new must-\nhave gadget of the moment, we cannot easily perceive the long-term effects on our health.\nUnfortunately, it is the most vulnerable members of our society that will be affected.\n \n2",
