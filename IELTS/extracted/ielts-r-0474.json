  "passage_text": "Reading Practice\n \nThe Flavour Industry\nA. Read through the nutritional information on the food in your freezer, refrigerator or\nkitchen pantry, and you are likely to find a simple, innocuous-looking ingredient recurring\non a number of products: “natural flavour”. The story of what natural flavour is, how it got\ninto your food, and where it came from is the result of more complex processes than you\nmight imagine.\nB. During the 1980s, health watchdogs and nutritionists began turning their attention to\ncholesterol, a waxy steroid metabolite that we mainly consume from animal-sourced\nproducts such as cheese, egg yolks, beef, poultry, shrimp, and pork. Nutritionists blamed\ncholesterol for contributing to the growing rates of obesity, heart disease, diabetes, and\nseveral cancers in Western societies. As extensive recognition of the matter grew amongst\nthe common people, McDonald’s stopped cooking their French fries in a mixture of\ncottonseed oil and beef tallow, and in 1990, the restaurant chain began using 100%\nvegetable oil instead.\nC. This substantially lowered the amount of cholesterol in McDonald’s fries, but it created a\nnew dilemma The beef tallow and cottonseed oil mixture gave the French fries high\ncholesterol content, but it also gifted them with a rich aroma and “mouth-feel” that even\nJames Beard, an American food critic, admitted he enjoyed. Pure vegetable oil is bland in\ncomparison. Looking at the current ingredients list of McDonald’s French fries, however, it\nis easy to see how they overcame this predicament. Aside from a few preservatives, there\nare essentially three main ingredients: potato, soybean oil, and the mysterious component\nof “natural flavour”.\nD. Natural flavour also entered our diet through the rise in processed foods, which now\nmake up over 90% (and growing) of the American diet, as well as representing a\nburgeoning industry in developing countries such as China and India Processed foods are\nessentially any foods that have been boxed, bagged, canned or packaged, and have a list\nof ingredients on the label. Sometimes, the processing involves adding a little sodium or\nsugar, and a few preservatives. Often, however, it is coloured, bleached, stabilized,\nemulsified, dehydrated, odour-concealed, and sweetened. This process typically saps any\noriginal flavour out of the product, and so, of course, flavour must be added back in as well.\nE. Often this is “natural flavour”, but while the term may bring to mind images of fresh\nbarley, hand-ground spices, and dried herbs being traded in a bustling street market, most\nof these natural sources are, in fact, engineered to culinary perfection in a set of factories\nand plants of the New Jersey Turnpike outside of New York. Here, firms such as\nInternational Flavors & Fragrances, Harmen & Keimer, Flavor Dynamics, Frutarom and\nElan Chemical isolate and manufacture the tastes that are incorporated in much of what we\neat and drink. The sweet, summery burst of naturally squeezed orange juice, the wood-\nsmoked aroma in barbeque sauces, and the creamy, buttery, fresh taste in many dairy\nproducts do not come from sun-drenched meadows or backyard grills but are formed in the\nlabs and test tubes of these flavour industry giants.\nF. The scientists – dubbed “flavourists” who create the potent chemicals that set our\nolfactory senses to overdrive use a mix of techniques that have been refined over many\nyears. Part of it is dense, intricate chemistry: spectrometers, gas chromatographs, and\nheadspace-vapor analyzers can break down components of a flavor in amounts as minute\n \n1\n\nas one part per billion. Not to be outdone, however, the human nose can isolate aromas\ndown to three parts per trillion. Flavourists, therefore, consider their work as much an art as\na science, and flavorism requires a nose “trained” with a delicate and poetic sense of\nbalance.\nG. Should we be wary of the industrialization of natural flavour? On its own, the trend may\nnot present any clear reason for alarm. Nutritionists widely agree that the real assault on\nhealth in the last few decades stems from an “unholy trinity” of sugar, fat, and sodium in\nprocessed foods. The natural flavour on its own is not a health risk. It does play a role,\nhowever, in helping these processed foods to taste fresh and nutritious, even when they\nare not. So, while the natural flavor industry should not be considered the culprit, we might\nthink of it as a willing accomplice.\n \n2",
