  "passage_text": "Reading Practice\nWhen the Tulip Bubble Burst\nTulips are spring-blooming perennials that grow from bulbs. Depending on the species,\ntulip plants can grow as short as 4 inches (10 cm) or as high as 28 inches (71 cm). The\ntulip’s large flowers usually bloom on scapes or sub-scapose stems that lack bracts. Most\ntulips produce only one flower per stem, but a few species bear multiple flowers on their\nscapes (e.g. Tulipa turkestanica). The showy, generally cup or star-shaped tulip flower has\nthree petals and three sepals, which are often termed tepals because they are nearly\nidentical. These six tepals are often marked on the interior surface near the bases with\ndarker colorings. Tulip flowers come in a wide variety of colors, except pure blue (several\ntulips with “blue” in the name have a faint violet hue)\nA. Long before anyone ever heard of Qualcomm, CMGI, Cisco Systems, or the other high-\ntech stocks that have soared during the current bull market, there was Semper Augustus.\nBoth more prosaic and more sublime than any stock or bond, it was a tulip of extraordinary\nbeauty, its midnight-blue petals topped by a band of pure white and accented with crimson\nflares. To denizens of 17th century Holland, little was as desirable.\nB. Around 1624, the Amsterdam man who owned the only dozen specimens was offered\n3,000 guilders for one bulb. While there’s no accurate way to render that in today’s\ngreenbacks, the sum was roughly equal to the annual income of a wealthy merchant. (A\nfew years later, Rembrandt received about half that amount for painting The Night Watch.)\nYet the bulb’s owner, whose name is now lost to history, nixed the offer.\nC. Who was crazier, the tulip lover who refused to sell for a small fortune or the one who\nwas willing to splurge. That’s a question that springs to mind after reading Tulip mania: The\nStory of the World’s Most Coveted Flower and the Extraordinary Passions It Aroused by\nBritish journalist Mike Dash. In recent years, as investors have intentionally forgotten\neverything they learned in Investing 101 in order to load up on unproved, unprofitable dot-\ncom issues, tulip mania has been invoked frequently. In this concise, artfully written\naccount, Dash tells the real history behind the buzzword and in doing so, offers a\ncautionary tale for our times.\nD. The Dutch were not the first to go gaga over the tulip. Long before the first tulip bloomed\nin Europe-in Bavaria, it turns out, in 1559-the flower had enchanted the Persians and\nbewitched the rulers of the Ottoman Empire. It was in Holland, however, that the passion\nfor tulips found its most fertile ground, for reasons that had little to do with horticulture.\nE. Holland in the early 17th century was embarking on its Golden Age. Resources that had\njust a few years earlier gone toward fighting for independence from Spain now flowed into\ncommerce. Amsterdam merchants were at the center of the lucrative East Indies trade,\nwhere a single voyage could yield profits of 400%. They displayed their success by\nerecting grand estates surrounded by flower gardens. The Dutch population seemed tom\nby two contradictory impulses: a horror of living beyond one’s means and the love of a long\nshot.\nF. Enter the tulip. “It is impossible to comprehend the tulip mania without understanding just\nhow different tulips were from every other flower known to horticulturists in the 17th\ncentury,” says Dash. “The colors they exhibited were more intense and more concentrated\nthan those of ordinary plants.” Despite the outlandish prices commanded by rare bulbs,\n \n1\n\nordinary tulips were sold by the pound. Around 1630, however, a new type of tulip fancier\nappeared, lured by tales of fat profits. These “florists,” or professional tulip traders, sought\nout flower lovers and speculators alike. But if the supply of tulip buyers grew quickly, the\nsupply of bulbs did not. The tulip was a conspirator in the supply squeeze: It takes seven\nyears to grow one from seed. And while bulbs can produce two or three clones, or “offsets,”\nannually, the mother bulb only lasts a few years.\nG. Bulb prices rose steadily throughout the 1630s, as ever more speculators into the\nmarket. Weavers and farmers mortgaged whatever they could to raise cash to begin\ntrading. In 1633, a farmhouse in Hoorn changed hands for three rare bulbs. By 1636 any\ntulip-even bulbs recently considered garbage-could be sold off, often for hundreds of\nguilders. A futures market for bulbs existed, and tulip traders could be found conducting\ntheir business in hundreds of Dutch taverns. Tulip mania reached its peak during the winter\nof 1636-37, when some bulbs were changing hands ten times in a day. The zenith came\nearly that winter, at an auction to benefit seven orphans whose only asset was 70 fine\ntulips left by then father. One, a rare Violetten Admirael van Enkhuizen bulb that was about\nto split in two, sold for 5,200 guilders, the all-time record. All told, the flowers brought in\nnearly 53,000 guilders.\nH.
