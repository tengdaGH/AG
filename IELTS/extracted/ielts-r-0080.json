  "passage_text": "Reading Practice\n \n \nBuild a Medieval Castle\nA. Michel Guyot, owner and restorer of Saint Fargeau castle in France, first had the\nidea of building a 13th-century style fortress following the discovery that the 15th-\ncentury red bricks of his castle obscured the stone walls of a much older\nstronghold. His dream was to build a castle just as it would have been in the Middle\nAges, an http://www.bo.com/iclti9 idea which some found mildly amusing and others\ndismissed as outright folly.\n \nHowever, Maryline Martin – project director – was inspired by the exciting potential for the\nventure to regenerate the region. It took several months to bring together and mobilise all\nthe various different partners: architects, archaeologists and financial backers. A site in the\nheart of Guédelon forest was found: a site which offered not only all the resources required\nfor building a castle – a stone quarry, an oak forest and a water supply – but in sufficient\nquantities to satisfy the demands of this gigantic site. The first team started work and on\nJune 20th 1997 the first stone was laid.\nB. Unlike any other present-day building site, Michel Guyot’s purpose is clear, he warmly\nwelcomes members of the public to participate. The workers’ role is to demonstrate and\nexplain, to a wide audience, the skills of our forefathers. Stone quarrying, the building of\nvaulted ceilings, the blacksmith’s work and the raising of roof timbers are just some of the\nactivities which visitors can witness during a visit to Guédelon. The workers are always on\nhand to talk about their craft and the progress of the castle.\n \nEach year 60,000 children visit Guédelon with their schools. The site is an excellent\neducational resource, bringing to life the history of the Middle Ages. Guided tours are\ntailored to the school curriculum and according to age groups: activity trails for primary\nschool children and interactive guided tours for secondary school children. Pupils of all\nages have the opportunity to follow in the footsteps of medieval stonemasons by taking part\nin a stonecarving workshop or discover the secrets of the medieval master-builders at the\ngeometry workshop.\nC. Workers in the Burgundy region of France are building a 13th century castle. They’re not\nrestoring an old castle. They’re actually building a new old castle. See the builders are\nconstructing it from scratch. The craftsmen have been working for nearly ten years now but\nthey’re not even halfway done yet. That’s because they’re using only medieval tools and\ntechniques. The World’s Gerry Hadden takes US to the site of what will be the Guedelon\nCastle. Another reason said by Jean Francois, a member of Guedelon stone cutter’s guild,\nfor eight hours a day he bangs on a 13th century chisel with a 13th century iron mallet.\nD. The progress of construction has to give way to tourists side for their visits. The visitors\nfrom 2010, however unsightly they may be, are vital to the project. The initial funding came\nnot from pillaging the local peasantry but from regional councils, the European Union and\nlarge companies. For the last 10 years, Guédelon, 100 miles southeast of Paris, has\nfunded itself from its entrance fees. Last year it had a record 300,000 visitors, who paid\nalmost €2.5m, making it the second most-visited site in Burgundy. The most visited site\n \n1\n\n \nwas the Hospice de Beaune, a beautiful 15th-century almshouse built 600 years before, or,\nif you prefer, 200 years “after”, Guédelon.\nE. limestone is found in the construction of various local buildings, from the great and\nprestigious edifice of Ratilly castle to the more modest poyaudines houses. This stone\ncontains 30-40% iron oxide; this can make it extremely hard to extract and dress. Having\nstudied the block in order to determine and anticipate the natural fault lines of the stone,\nthe quarrymen first carve a series of rectilinear holes into the block. Iron wedges are then\nhammered into this line of holes. The shockwaves produced by the quarrymen’s\nsledgehammers cause the stone to split along a straight line.\n \n \nThe highest quality blocks are dressed to produce lintels, voussoirs, corbels, ashlars etc.\nThe medium quality blocks are roughly shaped by the stonecutters and used on the\nuncoursed curtain walls, and as facing stones on the castle’s inner walls. There are water-\nfilled clay pits in the forest. Clay is taken from these pits, cleaned and pugged. It is then\nshaped in wooden moulds to form bricks. After the bricks have been left to air-dry, they are\nfired in a woodfired kiln for about 12 hours, at roughly 1000°c.\nF. The mortar is the “glue” used to bind the castle’s stones. It is made up of precise\ndoses of lime, sand and water. The people working there wear the tunics, skirts and\nheadgear that they might have worn then, but they wear these over jeans and shoes\nwith reinforced toes. They mix their mortar primarily as they would have done then,\nusing sand they dig themselves, but they are not allowed to use the extremely\neffective hot lime from medieval days, because of its toxicity, and so they add a\nmodem chemical ingredient instead, to achieve the same effect.\n \nWorkers in the Mid Age obviously were unaware of it and some died earlier by inhaling\ntoxic gas. And so, we met many wonderful people who do not pretend to be anything but\nmodem human beings practicing an old technique and finding out what it would have felt\nlike, as much as possible, to do it with only the resources of an older time.\nG. We also learned that even if there is a straight lintel across a doorway, you will usually\nfind an arch of stones built into the wall differently. Because of the physics of an arch,\nwhich channels the weight above it down into whatever is supporting it at each side instead\nof pressing down in the middle, this helps to take a lot of the weight off of the lintel itself,\nwhether it is free standing or buried in the wall against the impact of warfare. The arch is\nthe strongest element for spanning space in stone architecture. This is why, in ancient\nruins, you will often find the entire wall missing, and the arched windows and doorways still\nstanding, in beautiful patterns against the sky\n \n2",
