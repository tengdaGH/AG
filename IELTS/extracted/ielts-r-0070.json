  "passage_text": "Reading Practice\n \nBird Migration\nA. Birds have many unique design features that enable them to perform such\namazing feats of endurance. They are equipped with lightweight, hollow bones,\nintricately designed feathers providing both lift and thrust for rapid flight, navigation\nsystems superior to any that man has developed, and an ingenious heat conserving\ndesign that, among other things, concentrates all blood circulation beneath layers of\nwarm, waterproof plumage, leaving them fit to face life in the harshest of climates.\nTheir respiratory systems have to perform efficiently during sustained flights at\naltitude, so they have a system of extracting oxygen from their lungs that far\nexceeds that of any other animal. During the later stages of the summer breeding\nseason, when food is plentiful, their bodies can accumulate considerable layers of\nfat, to provide sufficient energy for their long migratory flights.\nB. The fundamental reason that birds migrate is to find adequate food during the\nwinter months when it is in short supply. This particularly applies to birds that breed\nin the temperate and Arctic regions of the Northern Hemisphere, where food is\nabundant during the short growing season. Many species can tolerate cold\ntemperatures if food is plentiful, but when food is not available, they must migrate.\nHowever, intriguing questions remain.\nC. One puzzling fact is that many birds journey much further than would be\nnecessary just to find food and good weather. Nobody knows, for instance, why\nBritish swallows, which could presumably survive equally well if they spent the\nwinter in equatorial Africa, instead of fly several thousands of miles further to their\npreferred winter home in South Africa’s Cape Province. Another mystery involves\nthe huge migrations performed by arctic terns and mudflat-feeding shorebirds that\nbreed close to Polar Regions. In general, the further north a migrant species breeds,\nthe further south it spends the winter. For arctic terns, this necessitates an annual\nround trip of 25,000 miles. Yet, en route to their final destination in far-flung southern\nlatitudes, all these individuals overfly other areas of seemingly suitable habitat\nspanning two hemispheres. While we may not fully understand birds’ reasons for\ngoing to particular places, we can marvel at their feats.\nD. One of the greatest mysteries is how young birds know how to find the traditional\nwintering areas without parental guidance. Very few adults migrate with juveniles in\ntow, and youngsters may even have little or no inkling of their parents’ appearance.\nA familiar example is that of the cuckoo, which lays its eggs in another species’ nest\nand never reencounters its young. It is mind-boggling to consider that, once raised\nby its host species, the young cuckoo makes its way to ancestral wintering grounds\nin the tropics before returning single-handedly to northern Europe the next season\nto seek out a mate among its kind. The obvious implication is that it inherits from its\nparents an inbuilt route map and direction-finding capability, as well as a mental\nimage of what another cuckoo looks like. Yet nobody has the slightest idea as to\nhow this is possible.\nE. Mounting evidence has confirmed that birds use the positions of the sun and\nstars to obtain compass directions. They also seem to be able to detect the earth’s\nmagnetic field, probably due to having minute crystals of magnetite in the region of\n \n1\n\ntheir brains. However, accurate navigation also requires an awareness of position\nand time, especially when lost. Experiments have shown that after being taken\nthousands of miles over an unfamiliar landmass, birds are still capable of returning\nrapidly to nest sites. Such phenomenal powers are the product of computing several\nsophisticated cues, including an inborn map of the night sky and the pull of the\nearth’s magnetic field. How the birds use their ‘instruments’ remains unknown, but\none thing is clear: they see the world with a superior sensory perception to ours.\nMost small birds migrate at night and take their direction from the position of the\nsetting sun. However, as well as seeing the sun go down, they also seem to see the\nplane of polarized light caused by it, which calibrates their compass. Travelling at\nnight provides other benefits. Daytime predators are avoided and the danger of\ndehydration due to flying for long periods in warm, sunlit skies is reduced.\nFurthermore, at night the air is generally cool and less turbulent and so conducive to\nsustained, stable flight.\nF. Nevertheless, all journeys involve considerable risk, and part of the skill in arriving safely\nis setting off at the right time. This means accurate weather forecasting and utilizing\nfavourable winds. Birds are adept at both, and, in laboratory tests, some have been shown\nto detect the minute difference in barometric pressure between the floor and ceiling of a\nroom. Often birds react to weather changes before there is any visible sign of them.\nLapwings, which feed on grassland, flee west from the Netherlands to the British Isles,\nFrance, and Spain at the onset of a cold snap. When the ground surface freezes, the birds\ncould starve. Yet they return to Holland ahead of a thaw, their arrival linked to a pressure\nchange presaging an improvement in the weather.\nG. In one instance a Welsh Manx shearwater carried to America and released was\nback in its burrow on Skokholm Island, off the Pembrokeshire coast, one day before\na letter announcing its release! Conversely, each autumn a small number of North\nAmerican birds are blown across the Atlantic by fast-moving westerly tailwinds. Not\nonly do they arrive safely in Europe, but, based on ringing evidence, some make it\nback to North America the following spring, after probably spending the winter with\nEuropean migrants in sunny African climes.\n \n2",
