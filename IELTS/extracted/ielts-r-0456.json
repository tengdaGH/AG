  "passage_text": "Reading Practice\n \nThe Development of Museums\nA\nThe conviction that historical relics provide infallible testimony about the past is rooted in\nthe nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, when science was regarded as objective and\nvalue free. As one writer observes: 'Although it is now evident that artefacts are as easily\naltered as chronicles, public faith in their veracity endures: a tangible relic seems ipso facto\nreal.' Such conviction was, until recently, reflected in museum displays. Museums used to\nlook - and some still do - much like storage rooms of objects packed together in\nshowcases: good for scholars who wanted to study the subtle differences in design, but not\nfor the ordinary visitor, to whom it all looked alike. Similarly, the information accompanying\nthe objects often made little sense to the lay visitor. The content and format of explanations\ndated back to a time when the museum was the exclusive domain of the scientific\nresearcher.\nB\nRecently, however, attitudes towards history and the way it should be presented have\naltered. The key word in heritage display is now 'experience', the more exciting the better\nand, if possible, involving all the senses. Good examples of this approach in the UK are the\nJorvik Centre in York; the National Museum of Photography, Film and Television in\nBradford; and the Imperial War Museum in London. In the US the trend emerged much\nearlier: Williamsburg has been a prototype for many heritage developments in other parts\nof the world. No one can predict where the process will end. On so-called heritage sites the\nre-enactment of historical events is increasingly popular, and computers will soon provide\nvirtual reality experiences, which will present visitors with a vivid image of the period of their\nchoice, in which they themselves can act as if part of the historical environment. Such\ndevelopments have been criticised as an intolerable vulgarisation, but the success of many\nhistorical theme parks and similar locations suggests that the majority of the public does\nnot share this opinion.\nC\nIn a related development, the sharp distinction between museum and heritage sites on the\none hand, and theme parks on the other, is gradually evaporating. They already borrow\nideas and concepts from one another. For example, museums have adopted story lines for\nexhibitions, sites have accepted 'theming'as a relevant tool, and theme parks are moving\ntowards more authenticity and research-based presentations. In zoos, animals are no\nlonger kept in cages, but in great spaces, either in the open air or in enormous\ngreenhouses, such as the jungle and desert environments in Burgers'Zoo in Holland. This\nparticular trend is regarded as one of the major developments in the presentation of natural\nhistory in the twentieth century.\nD\nTheme parks are undergoing other changes, too, as they try to present more serious social\nand cultural issues, and move away from fantasy. This development is a response to\nmarket forces and, although museums and heritage sites have a special, rather distinct,\nrole to fulfil, they are also operating in a very competitive environment, where visitors make\n \n1\n\nchoices on how and where to spend their free time. Heritage and museum experts do not\nhave to invent stories and recreate historical environments to attract their visitors: their\nassets are already in place. However, exhibits must be both based on artefacts and facts\nas we know them, and attractively presented. Those who are professionally engaged in the\nart of interpreting history are thus in a difficult position, as they must steer a narrow course\nbetween the demands of 'evidence' and 'attractiveness', especially given the increasing\nneed in the heritage industry for income-generating activities.\nE\nIt could be claimed that in order to make everything in heritage more 'real', historical\naccuracy must be increasingly altered. For example, Pithecanthropus erectus is depicted in\nan Indonesian museum with Malay facial features, because this corresponds to public\nperceptions. Similarly, in the Museum of Natural History in Washington, Neanderthal man\nis shown making a dominant gesture to his wife. Such presentations tell us more about\ncontemporary perceptions of the world than about our ancestors. There is one\ncompensation, however, for the professionals who make these interpretations: if they did\nnot provide the interpretation, visitors would do it for themselves, based on their own ideas,\nmisconceptions and prejudices. And no matter how exciting the result, it would contain a lot\nmore bias than the presentations provided by experts.\nF\nHuman bias is inevitable, but another source of bias in the representation of history has to\ndo with the transitory nature of the materials themselves. The simple fact is that not\neverything from history survives the historical process. Castles, palaces and cathedrals\nhave a longer lifespan than the dwellings of ordinary people. The same applies to the\nfurnishings and other contents of the premises. In a town like Leyden in Holland, which in\nthe seventeenth century was occupied by approximately the same number of inhabitants\nas today, people lived within the walled town, an area more than five times smaller than\nmodern Leyden. In most of the houses several families lived together in circumstances\nbeyond our imagination. Yet in museums, fine period rooms give only an image of the\nlifestyle of the upper class of that era. No wonder that people who stroll around exhibitions\nare filled with nostalgia; the evidence in museums indicates that life was so much better in\nthe past. This notion is induced by the bias in its representation in museums and heritage\ncentres.\n \n2",
