  "passage_text": "Reading Practice\n \nA Workaholic Economy\nFOR THE first century or so of the industrial revolution, increased productivity led to\ndecreases in working hours. Employees who had been putting in 12-hour days, six days a\nweek, found their time on the job shrinking to 10 hours daily, then, finally, to eight hours,\nfive days a week. Only a generation ago social planners worried about what people would\ndo with all this new-found free time. In the US, at least, it seems they need not have\nbothered.\nAlthough the output per hour of work has more than doubled since 1945, leisure seems\nreserved largely for the unemployed and underemployed. Those who work full-time spend\nas much time on the job as they did at the end of World War II. In fact, working hours have\nincreased noticeably since 1970 — perhaps because real wages have stagnated since that\nyear. Bookstores now abound with manuals describing how to manage time and cope with\nstress.\nThere are several reasons for lost leisure. Since 1979, companies have responded to\nimprovements in the business climate by having employees work overtime rather than by\nhiring extra personnel, says economist Juliet B. Schor of Harvard University. Indeed, the\ncurrent economic recovery has gained a certain amount of notoriety for its “jobless”\nnature: increased production has been almost entirely decoupled from employment. Some\nfirms are even downsizing as their profits climb. “All things being equal, we”d be better off\nspreading around the work,’ observes labour economist Ronald G. Ehrenberg of Cornell\nUniversity.\nYet a host of factors pushes employers to hire fewer workers for more hours and, at the\nsame time, compels workers to spend more time on the job. Most of those incentives\ninvolve what Ehrenberg calls the structure of compensation: quirks in the way salaries and\nbenefits are organised that make it more profitable to ask 40 employees to labour an extra\nhour each than to hire one more worker to do the same 40-hour job.\nProfessional and managerial employees supply the most obvious lesson along these lines.\nOnce people are on salary, their cost to a firm is the same whether they spend 35 hours a\nweek in the office or 70. Diminishing returns may eventually set in as overworked\nemployees lose efficiency or leave for more arable pastures. But in the short run, the\nemployer’s incentive is clear.\nEven hourly employees receive benefits - such as pension contributions and medical\ninsurance - that are not tied to the number of hours they work. Therefore, it is\nmore profitable for employers to work their existing employees harder.\nFor all that employees complain about long hours, they, too, have reasons not to trade\nmoney for leisure. “People who work reduced hours pay a huge penalty in career terms,”\nSchor maintains. “It”s taken as a negative signal’ about their commitment to the firm.’\n[Lotte] Bailyn [of Massachusetts Institute of Technology] adds that many corporate\nmanagers find it difficult to measure the contribution of their underlings to a firm’s well-\nbeing, so they use the number of hours worked as a proxy for output. “Employees know\nthis,” she says, and they adjust their behavior accordingly.\n“Although the image of the good worker is the one whose life belongs to the company,”\n \n1\n\nBailyn says, “it doesn't fit the facts.’ She cites both quantitative and qualitative studies that\nshow increased productivity for part-time workers: they make better use of the time they\nhave, and they are less likely to succumb to fatigue in stressful jobs. Companies that\nemploy more workers for less time also gain from the resulting redundancy, she asserts.\n“The extra people can cover the contingencies that you know are going to happen, such as\nwhen crises take people away from the workplace.’ Positive experiences with reduced\nhours have begun to change the more-is-better culture at some companies, Schor reports.\nLarger firms, in particular, appear to be more willing to experiment with flexible working\narrangements...\nIt may take even more than changes in the financial and cultural structures of employment\nfor workers successfully to trade increased productivity and money for leisure time, Schor\ncontends. She says the U.S. market for goods has become skewed by the assumption of\nfull-time, two-career households. Automobile makers no longer manufacture cheap models,\nand developers do not build the tiny bungalows that served the first postwar generation of\nhome buyers. Not even the humblest household object is made without a microprocessor.\nAs Schor notes, the situation is a curious inversion of the “appropriate technology” vision\nthat designers have had for developing countries: U.S. goods are appropriate only for high\nincomes and long hours.\nPaul Walluh\n \n2",
