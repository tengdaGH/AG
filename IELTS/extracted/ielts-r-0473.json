  "passage_text": "Reading Practice\n \nThe Farmers! Parade of history\nA\nHistory of Fanner trading company: In 1909 Robert Laidlaw establishes mail-order\ncompany Laidlaw Leeds in Fort Street, Auckland. Then, Branch expansion: purchase of\nGreen and Colebrook chain store; further provincial stores in Auckland and Waikato to\nfollow. Opening of first furniture and boot factory. In 1920, Company now has 29 branches;\nWhangarei store purchased. Doors open at Hobson Street for direct selling to public. The\nfirm establishes London and New York buying offices. With permission from the Harbour\nBoard, the large FARMERS electric sign on the Wyndham Street frontage is erected.\nB\nIn 1935, if the merchandise has changed, the language of the catalogues hasn’t Robert\nLaidlaw, the Scottish immigrant who established die century-old business, might have been\nscripting a modern-day television commercial when he told his earliest customers:\nSatisfaction, or your money back. “It was the first money back guarantee ever offered in\nNew Zealand by any firm,” says Ian Hunter, business historian. “And his mission statement\nwas, potentially, only the second one ever found in the world.” Laidlaw’s stated aims were\nsimple to build the greatest business in New Zealand, to simplify every transaction, to\neliminate all delays, to only sell goods it would pay the customer to buy.\nC\nThis year, the company that began as a mail-order business and now employs 3500 staff\nacross 58 stores turns 100. Its centenary will be celebrated with the release of a book and\nmajor community fundraising projects, to be announced next week. Hunter, who is writing\nthe centenary history, says “coming to a Fanners store once a week was a part of the New\nZealand way of life”. By 1960, one in every 10 people had an account with die company. It\nwas the place where teenage girls shopped for their first bra, where newlyweds purchased\ntheir first dinner sets, where first pay cheques were used to pay off hire purchase furniture,\nwhere Santa paraded every Christmas.\nD\nGary Blumenthal’s mother shopped there, and so does he. The fondest memory for the\nRotorua resident? “We were on holiday in Auckland… I decided that upon the lookout\ntower on top of the Farmers building would be a unique place to fit the ring on my new\nfiancee’s finger.” The lovebirds, who had to wait for “an annoying youth” to leave the tower\nbefore they could enjoy their engagement kiss, celebrate their 50th wedding anniversary in\nJune.\nE\nFarmers, says Hunter, has always had a heart. This, from a 1993 North & South interview\nwith a former board chairman, Rawdon Busfield: “One day I was in the Hobson Street shop\nand I saw a woman with two small children. They were clean and tidily dressed, but poor,\nyou could tell. That week we had a special on a big bar of chocolate for one shilling. I heard\nthe woman say to her boy, ‘no, your penny won’t buy that’. He wasn’t wearing shoes. So I\nwent up to the boy said,’ Son, have you got your penny? ‘He handed it to me. It was hot\n \n1\n\nhe’d had it in his hand for hours. I took the penny and gave him the chocolate.”\nF\nFarmers was once the home of genteel tearooms, children’s playgrounds and an annual\nsale of celebration for birthday of Hector the Parrot (the store mascot died, aged 131, in the\n1970s his stuffed remains still occupy pride of place at the company’s head office). You\ncould buy houses from Farmers. Its saddle factory supplied the armed forces, and its\nupright grand overstrung pianos offered “the acme of value” according to those early\ncatalogues hand-drawn by Robert Laidlaw himself. Walk through a Farmers store today\nand get hit by bright lights and big brands. Its Albany branch houses 16 international\ncosmetics companies. It buys from approximately 500 suppliers, and about 30% of those\nare locally owned.\nG\n“Eight, 10 years ago,” says current chief executive Rod McDermott, “lots of brands wouldn’t\npartner with us. The stores were quite distressed. We were first price point focused, we\nweren’t fashion focused. “Remove the rose-tinted nostalgia, and Farmers is, quite simply, a\nbusiness, doing business in hard times. Dancing with the Stars presenter Candy Lane\nlaunches a clothing line? “We put a trial on, and we thought it was really lovely, but the\nuptake wasn’t what we thought it would be. It’s got to be what the customer wants,” says\nMcDermott.\nH\nHe acknowledges retailers suffer in a recession: “We’re celebrating 100 years because we\ncan and because we should.” Farmers almost didn’t pull through one economic crisis. By\nthe mid 1980s, it had stores across the country. It had acquired the South Island’s Calder\nMackay chain of stores and bought out Haywrights. Then, with sales topping $375 million, it\nwas taken over by Chase Corporation. Lincoln Laidlaw, now aged 88, and the son of the\ncompany’s founder, remembers the dark days following the stock market crash and the\ncollapse of Chase. “I think, once, Farmers was like a big family and all of the people who\nworked for it felt they were building something which would ultimately be to their benefit\nand to the benefit of New Zealand… then the business was being divided up and so that\nkind of family situation was dispelled and it hasn’t been recovered.” For a turbulent few\nyears, the stores were controlled, first by a consortium of Australian banks and later Deka,\nthe Maori Development Corporation and Foodland Associated Ltd. In 2003, it went back to\n“family” ownership, with the purchase by the James Pascoe Group, owned by David and\nAnne Norman the latter being the great-granddaughter of James Pascoe, whose first\nbusiness interest was jewellery.\nI\n“Sheer power of the brand,” says McDermott, “pulled Farmers through and now we’re\nbecoming the brand it used to be again.” Farmers was the company that, during World War\nn, topped up the wages of any staff member disadvantaged by overseas service. Robert\nLaidlaw a committed Christian who came to his faith at a 1902 evangelistic service in\nDunedin concluded his original mission statement with the words, “all at it, always at it,\nwins success”. Next week, 58 Farmers stores across the country will announce the local\ncharities they will raise funds for in their centenary celebration everything from guide dog\nservices to hospices to volunteer fire brigades will benefit. Every dollar raised by the\n \n2\n\ncommunity will be matched by the company. “It’s like the rebirth of an icon,” says \nMcDermott.\n \n3",
