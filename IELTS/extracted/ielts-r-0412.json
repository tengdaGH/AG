  "passage_text": "Reading Practice\n \nStriking the right note\nIs perfect pitch a rare talent possessed solely by the likes of Beethoven? Kathryn\nBrown discusses this much sought-after musical ability.\nThe uncanny, if sometimes distracting, ability to name a solitary note out of the blue,\nwithout any other notes for reference, is a prized musical talent - and a scientific mystery.\nMusicians with perfect pitch - or, as many researchers prefer to call it, absolute pitch - can\noften play pieces by ear, and many can transcribe music brilliantly. That’s because they\nperceive the position of a note in the musical stave - its pitch - as clearly as the fact that\nthey heard it. Hearing and naming the pitch go hand in hand.\n \nBy contrast, most musicians follow not the notes, but the relationship between them. They\nmay easily recognise two notes as being a certain number of tones apart, but could name\nthe higher note as an E only if they are told the lower one is a C, for example. This is\nrelative pitch. Useful, but much less mysterious.\nFor centuries, absolute pitch has been thought of as the preserve of the musical elite.\nSome estimates suggest that maybe fewer than 1 in 2,000 people possess it. But a\ngrowing number of studies, from speech experiments to brain scans, are now suggesting\nthat a knack for absolute pitch may be far more common, and more varied, than previously\nthought. ‘Absolute pitch is not an all or nothing feature,’ says Marvin, a music theorist at the\nUniversity of Rochester in New York state. Some researchers even claim that we could all\ndevelop the skill, regardless of our musical talent. And their work may finally settle a\ndecades-old debate about whether absolute pitch depends on melodious genes - or early\nmusic lessons.\nMusic psychologist Diana Deutsch at the University of California in San Diego is the\nleading voice. Last month at the Acoustical Society of America meeting in Columbus, Ohio,\nDeutsch reported a study that suggests we all have the potential to acquire absolute pitch -\nand that speakers of tone languages use it every day. A third of the world’s population -\nchiefly people in Asia and Africa - speak tone languages, in which a word’s meaning can\nvary depending on the pitch a speaker uses.\nDeutsch and her colleagues asked seven native Vietnamese speakers and 15 native\nMandarin speakers to read out lists of words on different days. The chosen words spanned\na range of pitches, to force the speakers to raise and lower their voices considerably. By\nrecording these recited lists and taking the average pitch for each whole word, the\nresearchers compared the pitches used by each person to say each word on different\ndays.\nBoth groups showed strikingly consistent pitch for any given word - often less than a\nquarter-tone difference between days. ‘The similarity,’ Deutsch says, ‘is mind-boggling.’ It’s\nalso, she says, a real example of absolute pitch. As babies, the speakers learnt to\nassociate certain pitches with meaningful words - just as a musician labels one tone A and\nanother B - and they demonstrate this precise use of pitch regardless of whether or not\nthey have had any musical training, she adds.\nDeutsch isn’t the only researcher turning up everyday evidence of absolute pitch. At least\nthree other experiments have found that people can launch into familiar songs at or very\n \n1\n\nnear the correct pitches. Some researchers have nicknamed this ability ‘absolute memory’,\nand they say it pops up on other senses, too. Given studies like these, the real mystery is\nwhy we don’t all have absolute pitch, says cognitive psychologist Daniel Levitin of McGill\nUniversity in Montreal.\nOver the past decade, researchers have confirmed that absolute pitch often runs in\nfamilies. Nelson Freimer of the University of California in San Francisco, for example, is\njust completing a study that he says strongly suggests the right genes help create this\nbrand of musical genius. Freimer gave tone tests to people with absolute pitch and to their\nrelatives. He also tested several hundred other people who had taken early music lessons.\nHe found that relatives of people with absolute pitch were far more likely to develop the skill\nthan people who simply had the music lessons. There is clearly a familial aggregation of\nabsolute pitch,’ Freimer says.\nFreimer says some children are probably genetically predisposed toward absolute pitch -\nand this innate inclination blossoms during childhood music lessons. Indeed, many\nresearchers now point to this harmony of nature and nurture to explain why musicians with\nabsolute pitch show different levels of the talent.\nIndeed, researchers are finding more and more evidence suggesting music lessons are\ncritical to the development of absolute pitch. In a survey of 2,700 students in American\nmusic conservatories and college programmes, New York University geneticist Peter\nGregersen and his colleagues found that a whopping 32 per cent of the Asian students\nreported having absolute pitch, compared with just 7 per cent of non-Asian students.\nWhile that might suggest a genetic tendency towards absolute pitch in the Asian\npopulation, Gregersen says that the type and timing of music lessons probably explains\nmuch of the difference.\n \n \nFor one thing, those with absolute pitch started lessons, on average, when they were five\nyears old, while those without absolute pitch started around the age of eight. Moreover,\nadds Gregersen, the type of music lessons favoured in Asia, and by many of the Asian\nfamilies in his study, such as the Suzuki method, often focus on playing by ear and learning\nthe names of musical notes, while those more commonly used in the US tend to emphasise\nlearning scales in a relative pitch way. In Japanese pre-school music programmes, he\nsays, children often have to listen to notes played on a piano and hold up a coloured flag to\nsignal the pitch. ‘There’s a distinct cultural difference,’ he says.\nDeutsch predicts that further studies will reveal absolute pitch - in its imperfect, latent form -\ninside all of us. The Western emphasis on relative pitch simply obscures it, she contends.\n‘It’s very likely that scientists will end up concluding that we’re all born with the potential to\nacquire very fine-grained absolute pitch. It’s really just a matter of life getting in the way.’\n \n2",
