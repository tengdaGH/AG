  "passage_text": "Reading Practice\n \nHow do we find our way?\nA. Most modern navigation, such as the Global Positioning System (GPS), relies primarily\non positions determined electronically by receivers collecting information from satellites.\nYet if the satellite service’s digital maps become even slightly outdated, we can become\nlost. Then we have to rely on the ancient human skill of navigating in three dimensional\nspace. Luckily, our biological finder has an important advantage over GPS: we can ask\nquestions of people on the sidewalk, or follow a street that looks familiar, or rely on a\nnavigational rubric. The human positioning system is flexible and capable of learning.\nAnyone who knows the way from point A to point B-and from A to C-can probably figure out\nhow to get from B to C, too.\n \nB. But how does this complex cognitive system really work? Researchers are looking at\nseveral strategies people use to orient themselves in space: guidance, path integration and\nroute following. We may use all three or combinations thereof, and as experts learn more\nabout these navigational skills, they are making the case that our abilities may underlie our\npowers of memory and logical thinking. For example, you come to New York City for the\nfirst time and you get off the train at Grand Central Terminal in midtown Manhattan. You\nhave a few hours to see popular spots you have been told about: Rockefeller Center,\nCentral Park, and the Metropolitan Museum of Art. You meander in and out of shops along\nthe way. Suddenly, it is time to get back to the station. But how?\nC. If you ask passersby for help, most likely you will receive information in many different\nforms. A person who orients herself by a prominent landmark would gesture southward:\n“Look down there. See the tall, broad MetLife Building? Head for that- the station is right\nbelow it.” Neurologists call this navigational approach “guidance”, meaning that a landmark\nvisible from a distance serves as the marker for one’s destination.\n \nD. Another city dweller might say: “What places do you remember passing? … Okay. Go\ntoward the end of Central Park, then walk down to St. Patrick’s Cathedral. A few more\nblocks, and Grand Central will be off to your left.” In this case, you are pointed toward the\nmost recent place you recall, and you aim for it. Once there you head for the next notable\nplace and so on, retracing your path. Your brain is adding together the individual legs of\nyour trek into a cumulative progress report. Researchers call this strategy “path\nintegration.” Many animals rely primarily on path integration to get around, including\ninsects, spiders, crabs and rodents. The desert ants of the genus Cataglyphis employ this\nmethod to return from foraging as far as 100 yards away. They note the general direction\nthey came from and retrace their steps, using the polarization of sunlight to orient\nthemselves even under overcast skies. On their way back they are faithful to this inner\nhoming vector. Even when a scientist picks up an ant and puts it in a totally different spot,\nthe insect stubbornly proceeds in the originally determined direction until it has gone “back”\nall of the distance it wandered from its nest. Only then does the ant realize it has not\nsucceeded, and it begins to walk in successively larger loops to find its way home.\nE. Whether it is trying to get back to the anthill or the train station, any animal using path\nintegration must keep track of its own movements so it knows, while returning, which\n \n1\n\nsegments it has already completed. As you move, your brain gathers data from your\nenvironment-sights, sounds, smells, lighting, muscle contractions, a sense of time passing-\nto determine which way your body has gone. The church spire, the sizzling sausages on\nthat vendor’s grill, the open courtyard, and the train station-all represent snapshots of\nmemorable junctures during your journey.\n \nF. In addition to guidance and path integration, we use a third method for finding our way.\nAn office worker you approach for help on a Manhattan street comer might say: “Walk\nstraight down Fifth, turn left on 47th, turn right on Park, go through the walkway under the\nHelmsley Building, then cross the street to the MetLife Building into Grand Central.” This\nstrategy, called route following, uses landmarks such as buildings and street names, plus\ndirections straight, turn, go through—for reaching intermediate points. Route following is\nmore precise than guidance or path integration, but if you forget the details and take a\nwrong turn, the only way to recover is to backtrack until you reach a familiar spot, because\nyou do not know the general direction or have a reference landmark for your goal. The\nroute following navigation strategy truly challenges the brain. We have to keep all the\nlandmarks and intermediate directions in our head. It is the most detailed and therefore\nmost reliable method, but it can be undone by routine memory lapses. With path\nintegration, our cognitive memory is less burdened; it has to deal with only a few general\ninstructions and the homing vector. Path integration works because it relies most\nfundamentally on our knowledge of our body’s general direction of movement, and we\nalways have access to these inputs. Nevertheless, people often choose to give route-\nfollowing directions, in part because saying “Go straight that way!” just does not work in our\ncomplex, man made surroundings.\nG. Road Map or Metaphor? On your next visit to Manhattan you will rely on your memory to\nget present geographic information for convenient visual obviously seductive: maps\naround. Most likely you will use guidance, path integration and route following in various\ncombinations. But how exactly do these constructs deliver concrete directions? Do we\nhumans have, as an image of the real world, a kind of road map in our heads?\nNeurobiologists and cognitive psychologists do call the portion of our memory that controls\nnavigation a “cognitive map”. The map metaphor is are the easiest way to inspection. Yet\nthe notion of a literal map in our heads may be misleading; a growing body of research\nimplies that the cognitive map is mostly a metaphor. It may be more like a hierarchical\nstructure of relationships.\n \n2",
