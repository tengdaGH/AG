  "passage_text": "Reading Practice\nREFLECTING ON THE MIRROR\nIn all likelihood the first mirrors would have simply been pools of water that reflected the\nimage of the one who looked into it. Nature’s mirror, while cheap and readily accessible,\nmust have also been quite frustrating with the slightest disturbance on the surface of the\nwater making it difficult to see clearly. It is not altogether clear when the first man-made\nmirrors were produced but mirrors made of brass are mentioned in the Bible, and after that\nmirrors of bronze were in common use among the ancient Egyptians, Romans and Greeks.\nIn addition to bronze, the Greeks and Romans experimented with polished silver to\nproduce simple mirrors.\nCrude forms of glass mirrors were first made in Venice in 1300. Small sheets of glass were\ncut from disks made by a spinning process. When this glass was backed with a covering of\ntin or lead, a ‘mirror’ resulted. During the early periods of their development, mirrors were\nrare and expensive. France had glass factories but only in Venice, Italy was the secret of\nmirror foiling know n. The chemical process of coating a glass surface with metallic silver\nwas discovered by German chemist Justus von Liebig in 1835, and this advance\ninaugurated the modern techniques of mirror making.\nBy the end of the 17th century mirrors were made in Britain and the manufacture of mirrors\ndeveloped subsequently into an important industry in many other European countries.\nPeople wore them in their hats, or set them like jewels in their rings. Society glittered and\nshone like the firmament. A little later on, America was gripped by the mirror craze, only\nthis time they wore interested in larger mirrors. In house after house in residential districts\nand eastern cities there could be found one long mirror after another placed between two\nfront parlour windows.\nIn the manufacture of mirrors today, plate glass is cut to size, and all blemishes are\nremoved by polishing with rouge. The glass is scrubbed and flushed with a reducing\nsolution before silver is applied. The glass is then placed on a hollow, cast-iron tabletop,\ncovered with felt, and kept warm by steam. A solution of silver nitrate is poured on the\nglass and left undisturbed for about 1 hour. The silver nitrate is reduced to a metallic silver\nand a lustrous deposit of silver gradually forms. The deposit is dried, coated with shellac,\nand painted. Most present-day mirrors therefore, are made up of these layers. Glass is\nused on top because it is smooth, clear, and protects the reflective surface. A mirror needs\nto be very smooth in order for the best reflection to occur.\nMirrors may have plane or curved surfaces. A curved mirror is concave or convex\ndepending on whether the reflecting surface faces toward the centre of the curvature or\naway from it. Curved mirrors in ordinary usage have surfaces of varying shapes. Perhaps\nthe most common is spherical. Spherical mirrors produce images that are magnified or\nreduced – exemplified, by mirrors for applying facial makeup and by rear-view mirrors for\nvehicles. Cylindrical mirrors are another common type of shape. These focus a parallel\nbeam flight to a linear focus. A paraboloidal mirror is one which is often used to focus\nparallel rays to a sharp focus, as in a telescope mirror, or to produce a parallel beam from a\nsource at its focus, such as a searchlight. A less common but useful shape is the\nellipsoidal. Such a mirror will reflect light from one of its two focal points to the other.\nWhile the mirror is the focus of the production, the frame plays an important albeit slightly\nlesser role as the anchor by which the mirror is affixed to its proper place. From the late\n \n1\n\n17th century onward, mirrors and their frames played an increasingly important part in the\ndecoration of rooms. Complementing the shiny reflective mirror, the early frames were\nusually of ivory, silver, ebony, or tortoiseshell or were veneered with walnut, olive, and\nlaburnum. Needlework and bead frames were also to be found. Craftsmen such as Grinling\nGibbons often produced elaborately carved mirror frames to match a complete decorative\nensemble. The tradition soon became established of incorporating a mirror into the space\nover the mantelpiece; many of the early versions of these mirrors, usually known\nas overmantels, were enclosed in glass frames. The architectural structure of which these\nmirrors formed a part became progressively more elaborate. Focusing heavily on the effect\ncreated by mirrors, 18th century designers such as the English brothers Robert and James\nAdam created fireplace units stretching from the hearth to the ceiling. Oil the whole, mirror\nframes reflected the general taste of the time and were often changed to accommodate\nalterations in taste – frames usually being cheaper and hence more easily replaced than\nthe mirror itself.\nBy the end of the 18th century, painted decoration largely supplanted carving on mirrors,\nthe frames being decorated with floral patterns or classical ornaments. At the same time\nthe French started producing circular mirrors. Usually surrounded by a neoclassical gilt\nframe that sometimes supported candlesticks, these mirrors enjoyed great popularity well\ninto the 19thImproved skill in mirror making also made possible die introduction of the\ncheval glass, a freestanding full-length mirror, supported on a frame with four feet. These\nwere mainly used for dressing purposes, though occasionally they had a decorative\nfunction. New, cheaper techniques of mirror production in the 19th century led to a great\nproliferation in their use. Not only were they regularly incorporated into pieces of furniture –\nsuch as wardrobes and sideboards – they were also used in everything from high-powered\ntelescopes to decorative schemes in public places. Their popularity continues today.\nThrough them, infants are able to develop an awareness of their individuality through\n‘mirror games’.
