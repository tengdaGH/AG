  "passage_text": "Reading Practice\n \n \nWhat is a dinosaur?\n \nA. Although the name dinosaur is derived from the Greek for \"terrible lizard\", dinosaurs\nwere not, in fact, lizards at all. Like lizards, dinosaurs are included in the class Reptilia, or\nreptiles, one of the five main classes of Vertebrata, animals with backbones. However, at\nthe next level of classification, within reptiles, significant differences in the skeletal anatomy\nof lizards and dinosaurs have led scientists to place these groups of animals into two\ndifferent superorders: Lepidosauria, or lepidosaurs, and Archosauria, or archosaurs.\nB. Classified as lepidosaurs are lizards and snakes and their prehistoric ancestors.\nIncluded among the archosaurs, or \"ruling reptiles\", are prehistoric and modern crocodiles,\nand the now extinct thecodonts, pterosaurs and dinosaurs. Palaeontologists believe that\nboth dinosaurs and crocodiles evolved, in the later years of the Triassic Period (c. 248-208\nmillion years ago), from creatures called pseudosuchian thecodonts. Lizards, snakes and\ndifferent types of thecodont are believed to have evolved earlier in the Triassic Period from\nreptiles known as eosuchians.\n \nC.  The most important skeletal differences between dinosaurs and other archosaurs are in\nthe bones of the skull, pelvis and limbs. Dinosaur skulls are found in a great range of\nshapes and sizes, reflecting the different eating habits and lifestyles of a large and varied\ngroup of animals that dominated life on Earth for an extraordinary 165 million years.\nHowever, unlike the skulls of any other known animals, the skulls of dinosaurs had two long\nbones known as vomers. These bones extended on either side of the head, from the front\nof the snout to the level of the holes on the skull known as the antorbital fenestra, situated\nin front of the dinosaur's orbits or eyesockets.\n  \nD. All dinosaurs, whether large or small, quadrupedal or bidepal, fleet-footed or slow-\nmoving, shared a common body plan. Identification of this plan makes it possible to\ndifferentiate dinosaurs from any other types of animal, even other archosaurs. Most\nsignificantly, in dinosaurs, the pelvis and femur had evolved so that the hind limbs were\nheld vertically beneath the body, rather than sprawling out to the sides like the limbs of a\nlizard. The femur of a dinosaur had a sharply in-turned neck and a ball-shaped head, which\nslotted into a fully open acetabulum or hip socket. A supra-acetabular crest helped prevent\ndislocation of the femur. The position of the knee joint, aligned below the acetabulum,\nmade it possible for the whole hind limb to swing backwards and forwards. This unique\ncombination of features gave dinosaurs what is known as a \"fully improved gait\". Evolution\nof this highly efficient method of walking also developed in mammals, but among reptiles it\noccurred only in dinosaurs.\n \nE. For the purpose of further classification, dinosaurs are divided into two orders:\nSaurischia, or saurischian dinosaurs, and Ornithischia, or ornithischian dinosaurs. This\ndivision is made on the basis of their pelvic anatomy. All dinosaurs had a pelvic girdle with\neach side comprised of three bones: the pubis, ilium and ischium. However, the orientation\nof these bones follows one of two patterns. In saurischian dinosaurs, also known as lizard-\nhipped dinosaurs, the pubis points forwards, as is usual in most types of reptile. By\ncontrast, in ornithischian, or bird-hipped, dinosaurs, the pubis points backwards towards\nthe rear of the animal, which is also true of birds.\nF. Of the two orders of dinosaurs, the Saurischia was the larger and the first to evolve. It is\ndivided into two suborders: Therapoda, or therapods, and Sauropodomorpha, or\n \n1\n\nsauropodomorphs. The therapods, or \"beast feet\", were bipedal, predatory carnivores.\nThey ranged in size from the mighty Tyrannosaurus rex, 12m long, 5.6m tall and weighing\nan estimated 6.4 tonnes, to the smallest known dinosaur, Compsognathus, a mere 1.4m\nlong and estimated 3kg in weight when fully grown. The sauropodomorphs, or \"lizard feet\nforms\", included both bipedal and quadrupedal dinosaurs. Some sauropodomorphs were\ncarnivorous or omnivorous but later species were typically herbivorous. They included\nsome of the largest and best-known of all dinosaurs, such as Diplodocus, a huge\nquadruped with an elephant-like body, a long, thin tail and neck that gave it a total length of\n27m, and a tiny head.\n \nG.  Ornithischian dinosaurs  were bipedal or quadrupedal herbivores. They are now usually\ndivided into three suborders: Ornithipoda, Thyreophora and Marginocephalia. The\nornithopods, or \"bird feet\", both large and small, could walk or run on their long hind legs,\nbalancing their body by holding their tails stiffly off the ground behind them. An example is\nIguanodon, up to 9m long, 5m tall and weighing 4.5 tonnes. The thyreophorans, or \"shield\nbearers\", also known as armoured dinosaurs, were quadrupeds with rows of protective\nbony spikes, studs, or plates along their backs and tails. They included Stegosaurus, 9m\nlong and weighing 2 tonnes.\nH. The marginocephalians, or \"margined heads\", were bipedal or quadrupedal\nornithschians with a deep bony frill or narrow shelf at the back of the skull. An example is\nTriceratops, a rhinoceros-like dinosaur, 9m long, weighing 5.4 tonnes and bearing a\nprominent neck frill and three large horns.\n \n2",
