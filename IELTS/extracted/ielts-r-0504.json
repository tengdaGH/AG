  "passage_text": "Reading Practice\n \nThe Invention of Television\nThe question “Who invented television?” is simple enough, but the answer is surprisingly\ncontroversial. No one person was responsible for producing what we think of as television\ntoday and the credit is due to various inventors.\nThe Scotsman, John Logie Baird, is considered by many to be the inventor of television. He\nshowed early signs of his inventing ingenuity by setting up a telephone exchange to\nconnect his house to those of his friends near by. His first interest in television came in\n1903, after he read a German book on the photoelectric properties of selenium. In 1873,\nthis element was discovered to have the capacity to generate a current based on the\namount of light applied to it. Working initially in Hastings, England, Baird famously created\nan apparatus using an old hatbox he bought in a used goods store, a pair of scissors, some\nneedles, some bicycle light lenses and an old tea chest. Baird also used a Nipkow disk,\ncreated by German inventor, Paul Nipkow, and a lot of his work was based on the previous\nwork by German, Arthur Korn. In February 1924, Baird demonstrated moving silhouette\nimages on a ‘television’. Later that year, after nearly destroying the house and nearly killing\nhimself with an electric shock, Baird moved to London, where he gave the first public\ndisplay of his invention. On 2 October 1925, Baird used an office assistant, William\nTaynton, to move for his transmitted pictures, and Taynton became the first person to be\ntelevised moving and in full tonal range. Baird is also later credited with demonstrating the\nfirst images on colour television, on 3rd July 1928, although the credit for being the inventor\nof colour television is again disputed. Another first for Baird was transmitting the first\ntelevision pictures across the Atlantic in 1928. Although Baird was well known for his\ninvention, he also became famous for refusing an offer of £100,000 for the shares in his\ncompany, which was an enormous sum at that time. Baird famously said that he would not\nbe able to sleep at night, knowing he had that much money.\nPhilo Farnsworth successfully demonstrated electronic television in San Francisco, in 1927,\nusing a different system. Farnsworth realised that a picture could be dissected by a simple\ntelevision camera into a series of lines of electricity. The lines would be transmitted so\nquickly that the eyes would merge the lines. Then, an image dissector, which Farnsworth\ncreated, would change those lines back into a picture. The Russian inventor, Vladimir\nZworykin, built on this work and it was Zworykin’s designs that were eventually used by the\nBBC in the UK to replace Baird’s system.\nBaird’s initial work would not have been successful without the previous work of Paul\nNipkow. Nipkow came up with the idea of ‘scanning’ a television image by using a spinning\ndisk with a spiral of small pinholes. When spun at a high rate of speed, each hole would\nallow light to fall on a selenium cell on the other side of the disk. The amount of voltage the\ncell generated would depend on the amount of light reflected from the object being\nphotographed. One rotation of the disk equalled one frame of “video”. At the place where\nthe signal was received, the process would be reversed. A similar disk spun in sync and a\nneon lamp reacted to the changes in voltage with the speed required to keep up with the\nspinning disk and projected the images onto a screen. Although Nipkow created the disk\nand acquired a patent for his invention, he did not create the apparatus to project images.\nThe patent expired after 15 years, as no one was interested then in the work. Baird’s first\npractical television systems used an electro-mechanical picture scanning method, the\nmethod that Nipkow had helped create with his disk. Nipkow became a celebrated scientist\n \n1\n\n \nin Germany for his work, but the mechanical nature of the Nipkow Disk caused the\ninvention to fade to obscurity with the use of the cathode ray tube.\n \nArthur Korn was another German scientist working in the same field as Baird and Nipkow\nand it was his work that allowed the development of Nipkow’s work that in turn led to\nBaird’s breakthroughs. Korn’s early work was focused on the transmission of visual\ntelegraphic transmission, using his developments in amplification tube technology. He sent\na picture of the German Crown Prince 1800 kilometres in 1906 and sent a picture of the\nPope across the Atlantic in 1923. Korn’s work was celebrated and, from 1928, the German\npolice used his technology to send photographs and fingerprints.\nFinally, another American, Charles Francis Jenkins, has a claim to be the inventor of\ntelevision. Jenkins, who at the time was very well known for inventing the motion picture\nprojector, first transmitted a silhouette picture from one room to another in 1922. Jenkins\nfounded a broadcasting company in 1928, but the crash of 1929 forced him out of\nbusiness. Most people agree that Baird gave his first public demonstration of television a\ncouple years earlier than Jenkins, but this is disputed in some places.\nIt is plain to see why any claim to be the inventor of television is said to be controversial. In\nmany cases, the answer to the question, “Who invented television?”, often just depends on\nfrom which country the person answering the question is.\n \n2",
