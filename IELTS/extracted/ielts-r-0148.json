  "passage_text": "Reading Practice\n \nElnino and Seabirds\nA Rhythm of the seasons cannot always be relied upon. At times the tropical Pacific Ocean\nand large expanses of the global atmosphere seem to be marching to the beat of a\ndifferent drummer, disrupting the normal patterns of countless species of plants and\nanimals along with hundreds of millions of human beings. So they want anticipate these\noccasional lapses in the march of the seasons and help societies plan accordingly,\nscientists are seeking to understand these competing rhythms: the strongest of which is the\nalternation between the “normal climate” and a different but still recurrent set of climatic\nconditions in the Pacific region called El Nino.\n \nB Seabirds are prominent and highly visible components of marine ecosystems that will be\naffected by global climate change. The Bering Sea region is particularly important to\nseabirds; populations there are larger and more diverse than in any similar region in North\nAmerica—over 90% of seabirds breeding in the continental United States are found in this\nregion. Seabirds, so named because they spend at least 80% of their lives at sea, are\ndependent upon marine resources for food. As prey availability changes in response to\nclimatically driven factors such as surface sea temperature and extent of sea ice, so will\npopulations of seabirds be affected.\nC Seabirds are valued as indicators of healthy marine ecosystems and provide a “vicarious\nuse value” or existence value—people appreciate and value seabirds simply because they\nare there and enjoy them through venues such as pictures, nature programs, and written\naccounts without ever directly observing seabirds in their native environment. A direct\nmeasure of this value is demonstrated by Federal legislation that established specific\nnational wildlife refuges to protect seabirds and international treaty obligations that provide\nadditional protection for seabirds. Seabirds are also an important subsistence resource for\nmany who live within the Bering Sea Region. Furthermore, the rich knowledge base about\nseabirds makes them a valuable resource as indicator species for measurement of change\nin the marine environment.\nD The most abundant breeding species in Alaska are northern fulmars, storm-petrels,\nkittiwakes, murres, auklets and puffins. These species also form the largest colonies.\nFulmars, storm-petrels and kittiwakes are surface feeders, picking their prey from the\nsurface or just below the surface; murres, auklets, and puffins dive for their food. Fulmars\nnest primarily on island groups in and around the Bering Sea. They take a wide variety of\nprey (e.g., fish, squid, zooplankton, jellyfish) from the surface or just below the surface.\nStorm-petrels are strictly nocturnal and nest below ground in either burrows or crevices\nbetween rocks. They forage on zooplankton and squid; in some areas they are dependent\nupon small fish such as capelin and sand lance caught at the surface. Black-legged\nkittiwakes are widespread throughout Alaska, Canada and Eurasia while red-legged\nkittiwakes are found only in the Bering Sea region. Both are surface feeders although\nblack-legged kittiwakes feed primarily on small fish and forage over the continental shelf\nand shelf break; red-legged kittiwakes feed primarily on myctophids and will forage beyond\nthe shelf break.\nE Marine mammals have exhibited similar signs of food stress in recent years. Harbor\nseals at Tugidak Island in the Gulf of Alaska declined by about 85% between 1976 and\n \n1\n\n \n1988 . Steller sea lion populations declined by 36% in the Gulf of Alaska between 1977 and\n1985 , and by another 59% between 1985 and . Northern fur seals declined about 35% by\n1986 from their average numbers in the 1970s, although numbers had rebounded\nsomewhat (20%) by 1990 . Associated with the declines in Steller sea lions are declines in\nbirth rate, fewer breeding females, fewer pups, decreased adult body condition, decreased\njuvenile survival, and a change in population age structure.\nF Walker noticed that monsoon seasons with low-index conditions are often marked by\ndrought in Australia, Indonesia, India, and parts of Africa. He also claimed that low-index\nwinters tend to be unusually mild in western Canada. One of his British colleagues chided\nhim in print for suggesting that climatic conditions over such widely separated regions of\nthe globe could be linked. In his reply Walker predicted, correctly, that an explanation\nwould be forthcoming, but that it would require a knowledge of wind patterns above ground\nlevel, which were not routinely being observed at that time.\nG The need for long-term time series It seems obvious that without good baseline data\nornithologists are doomed to be surprised by the arrival of El Nino every few years. Even\nwhen ornithologists and ecologists are at hand to take advantage of an incoming El Nino,\nlack of preexisting data, and of monitoring afterwards, makes it difficult 134 F.M. Jaksic &\nJ.M. Farina to understand responses of birds to the successive El Nino, La Nina, and\n“normal” years. Indeed, according to Jaksic, during the last century there were 12 El Nino\nyears and 12 La Nina years, thus leaving about 76 ‘normal’ years in between. Thus, by\nheavily concentrating attention on only 12% of the time span El Nino, and of neglecting\npossibly another 12% , ornithologists are essentially ignoring what happens during 76% of\nthe time. This situation may be remedied only as long as data are logged on a regular or\ncontinuous basis, that is, as long-term time series. The recipe prescribed by Schreiber &\nSchreiber to understand El Nino, effects on birds still stands: ‘…carry out long-term studies\nthat will shed further light on the interactions between global atmospheric cycles,\noceanographic phenomena, and avian populations.’\nH Populations of seabirds in Alaska are larger and more diverse than any similar region in\nthe Northern Hemisphere. The extensive coastal estuaries and offshore waters of Alaska\nprovide breeding, feeding and migrating habitats for 66 species of seabirds. At least 38\nspecies of seabirds, over 50 million individuals, breed in Alaska. Eight Alaskan species\nbreed only here and in adjacent Siberia. Five additional species range through the North\nPacific, but their populations are concentrated in Alaska. In addition to breeding grounds,\nAlaskan waters also provide important wintering habitat for birds that breed in Canada and\nEurasia. Shearwaters, which breed in the southern hemisphere, are the most numerous\nspecies in Alaskan waters during the summer.\nI As another indication that food has been limiting in recent years, several largescale die-\noffs of seabirds, mostly surface-feeding species, have been observed in the Gulf of Alaska\nduring the last decade, most notably in 1983, 1989and 1993 . But Hatch thinks that it is too\nearly to decide the these die-offs reports are somehow connected with effect of El nino.\nByrd and Tobish believe that high rainfall can affect survival of chicks in earthen burrows,\nand incidence of big storms with high winds during the chick-rearing period can cause\nmortality for chicks of species nesting on cliff-ledges, but this view has not been considered\nas convincing evidence.\n \n2",
