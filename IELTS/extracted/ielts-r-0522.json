  "passage_text": "Reading Practice\n \nThe nature and aims of archaelogy\nArchaeology is partly the discovery of the treasures of the past, partly the careful work of\nthe scientific analyst, partly the exercise of the creative imagination. It is toiling in the sun\non an excavation in the Middle East, it is working with living Inuit in the snows of Alaska,\nand it is investigating the sewers of Roman Britain. But it is also the painstaking task of\ninterpretation, so that we come to understand what these things mean for the human story.\nAnd it is the conservation of the world's cultural heritage against looting and careless harm.\nArchaeology, then, is both a physical activity out in the field, and an intellectual pursuit in\nthe study or laboratory. That is part of its great attraction. The rich mixture of danger and\ndetective work has also made it the perfect vehicle for fiction writers and film-makers, from\nAgatha Christie with Murder in Mesopotamia to Stephen Spielberg with Indiana Jones.\nHowever far from reality such portrayals are, they capture the essential truth that\narchaeology is an exciting quest - the quest for knowledge about ourselves and our past.\n \nBut how does archaeology relate to disciplines such as anthropology and history, that are\nalso concerned with the human story? Is archaeology itself a science? And what are the\nresponsibilities of the archaeologist in today's world?\nAnthropology, at its broadest, is the study of humanity - our physical characteristics as\nanimals and our unique non-biological characteristics that we call culture. Culture in this\nsense includes what the anthropologist, Edward Tylor, summarised in 1871 as 'knowledge,\nbelief, art, morals, custom and any other capabilities and habits acquired by man as a\nmember of society'. Anthropologists also use the term 'culture’ in a more restricted sense\nwhen they refer to the ‘culture1 of a particular society, meaning the non-biological\ncharacteristics unique to that society, which distinguish it from other societies.\nAnthropology is thus a broad discipline - so broad that it is generally broken down into three\nsmaller disciplines: physical anthropology, cultural anthropology and archaeology.\nPhysical anthropology, or biological anthropology as it is also called, concerns the study of\nhuman biological or physical characteristics and how they evolved. Cultural anthropology -\nor social anthropology - analyses human culture and society. Two of its branches are\nethnography (the study at first hand of individual living cultures) and ethnology (which sets\nout to .compare cultures using ethnographic evidence to derive general principles about\nhuman society).\nArchaeology is the ‘past tense of cultural anthropology’. Whereas cultural anthropologists\nwill often base their conclusions on the experience of living within contemporaly\ncommunities, archaeologists study past societies primarily through their material remains -\nthe buildings, tools, and other artefacts that constitute what is known as the material culture\nleft over from former societies.\nNevertheless, one of the most important tasks for the archaeologist today is to know how to\ninterpret material culture in human terms. How were those pots used? Why are some\ndwellings round and others square? Here the methods of archaeology and ethnography\noverlap. Archaeologists in recent decades have developed ‘ethnoarchaeology’, where, like\nethnographers, they live among contemporary communities, but with the specific purpose\nof learning how such societies use material culture - how they make their tools and\nweapons, why they build their settlements where they do, and so on. Moreover,\n \n1\n\narchaeology has an active role to play in the field of conservation. Heritage studies\nconstitutes a developing field, where it is realised that the world's cultural heritage is a\ndiminishing resource which holds different meanings for different people.\nIf, then, archaeology deals with the past, in what way does it differ from history? In the\nbroadest sense, just as archaeology is an aspect of anthropology, so too is it a part of\nhistory - where we mean the whole history of humankind from its beginnings over three\nmillion years ago. Indeed, for more than ninety-nine per cent of that huge span of time,\narchaeology - the study of past material culture - is the only significant source of\ninformation. Conventional historical sources begin only with the introduction of written\nrecords around 3,000 BC in western Asia, and much later in most other parts of the world.\nA commonly drawn distinction is between pre-history, i.e. the period before written records\n- and history in the narrow sense, meaning the study of the past using written evidence. To\narchaeology, which studies all cultures and periods, whether with or without writing, the\ndistinction between history and pre-history is a convenient dividing line that recognises the\nimportance of the written word, but in no way lessens the importance of the useful\ninformation contained in oral histories.\nSince the aim of archaeology is the understanding of humankind, it is a humanistic study,\nand since it deals with the human past, it is a historical discipline. But it differs from the\nstudy of written history in a fundamental way. The material the archaeologist finds does not\ntell us directly what to think. Historical records make statements, offer opinions and pass\njudgements. The objects the archaeologists discover, on the other hand, tell us nothing\ndirectly in themselves. In this respect, the practice of the archaeologist is rather like that of\nthe scientist, who collects data, conducts experiments, formulates a hypothesis, tests the\nhypothesis against more data, and then, in conclusion, devises a model that seems best to\nsummarise the pattern observed in the data. The archaeologist has to develop a picture of\nthe past, just as the scientist has to develop a coherent view of the natural world. \n \n2",
