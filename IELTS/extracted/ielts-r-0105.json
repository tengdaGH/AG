  "passage_text": "Reading Practice\n \nCommunication in Science\nA\nScience plays an increasingly significant role in people’s lives, making the faithful\ncommunication of scientific developments more important than ever. Yet such\ncommunication is fraught with challenges that can easily distort discussions, leading to\nunnecessary confusion and misunderstandings.\nB\nSome problems stem from the esoteric nature of current research and the associated\ndifficulty of finding sufficiently faithful terminology. Abstraction and complexity are not signs\nthat a given scientific direction is wrong, as some commentators have suggested, but are\ninstead a tribute to the success of human ingenuity in meeting the increasingly complex\nchallenges that nature presents. They can, however, make communication more difficult.\nBut many of the biggest challenges for science reporting arise because in areas of evolving\nresearch, scientists themselves often only partly understand the full implications of any\nparticular advance or development. Since that dynamic applies to most of the scientific\ndevelopments that directly affect people’s lives global warming, cancer research, diet\nstudies – learning how to overcome it is critical to spurring a more informed scientific\ndebate among the broader public.\nC\nAmbiguous word choices are the source of some misunderstandings. Scientists often\nemploy colloquial terminology, which they then assign a specific meaning that is impossible\nto fathom without proper training. The term “relativity,” for example, is intrinsically\nmisleading. Many interpret the theory to mean that everything is relative and there are no\nabsolutes. Yet although the measurements any observer makes depend on his coordinates\nand reference frame, the physical phenomena he measures have an invariant description\nthat transcends that observer’s particular coordinates. Einstein’s theory of relativity is really\nabout finding an invariant description of physical phenomena. True, Einstein agreed with\nthe idea that his theory would have been better named “Invarianten theorie.” But the term\n“relativity” was already entrenched at the time for him to change. \nD\n“The uncertainty principle” is another frequently abused term. It is sometimes interpreted as\na limitation on observers and their ability to make measurements.\nE\nBut it is not about intrinsic limitations on any one particular measurement; it is about the\ninability to precisely measure particular pairs of quantities simultaneously? The first\ninterpretation is perhaps more engaging from a philosophical or political perspective. It’s\njust not what the science is about.\nF\nEven the word “theory” can be a problem. Unlike most people, who use the word to\n \n1\n\ndescribe a passing conjecture that they often regard as suspect, physicists have very\nspecific ideas in mind when they talk about theories. For physicists, theories entail a\ndefinite physical framework embodied in a set of fundamental assumptions about the world\nthat lead to a specific set of equations and predictions – ones that are borne out by\nsuccessful predictions. Theories aren’t necessarily shown to be correct or complete\nimmediately. Even Einstein took the better part of a decade to develop the correct version\nof his theory of general relativity. But eventually both the ideas and the measurements\nsettle down and theories are either proven correct, abandoned or absorbed into other,\nmore encompassing theories.\nG\n“Global warming” is another example of problematic terminology. Climatologists predict\nmore drastic fluctuations in temperature and rainfall – not necessarily that every place will\nbe warmer. The name sometimes subverts the debate, since it lets people argue that their\nwinter was worse, so how could there be global warming? Clearly “global climate change”\nwould have been a better name. But not all problems stem solely from poor word choices.\nSome stem from the intrinsically complex nature of much of modern science. Science\nsometimes transcends this limitation: remarkably, chemists were able to detail the precise\nchemical processes involved in the destruction of the ozone layer, making the evidence\nthat chlorofluorocarbon gases (Freon, for example) were destroying the ozone layer\nindisputable.\nH\nA better understanding of the mathematical significance of results and less insistence on a\nsimple story would help to clarify many scientific discussions. For several months, Harvard\nwas tortured months, Harvard was tortured by empty debates over the relative intrinsic\nscientific abilities of men and women. One of the more amusing aspects of the discussion\nwas that those who believed in the differences and those who didn’t use the same\nevidence about gender-specific special ability? How could that be? The answer is that the\ndata shows no substantial effects. Social factors might account for these tiny differences,\nwhich in any case have an unclear connection to scientific ability. Not much of a headline\nwhen phrased that way, is it? Each type of science has its own source of complexity and\npotential for miscommunication. Yet there are steps we can take to improve public\nunderstanding in all cases. The first would be to inculcate greater understanding and\nacceptance of indirect scientific evidence. The information from an unmanned space\nmission is no less legitimate than the information from one in which people are on board.\nI\nThis doesn’t mean questioning an interpretation, but it also doesn’t mean equating indirect\nevidence with blind belief, as people sometimes suggest. Second, we might need different\nstandards for evaluating science with urgent policy implications than research with the\npurely theoretical value. When scientists say they are not certain about their predictions, it\ndoesn’t necessarily mean they’ve found nothing substantial. It would be better if scientists\nwere more open about the mathematical significance of their results and if the public didn’t\ntreat math as quite so scary; statistics and errors, which tell us the uncertainty in a\nmeasurement, give us the tools to evaluate new developments fairly.\nJ\n \n2\n\nBut most important, people have to recognize that science can be complex. If we accept\nonly simple stories, the description will necessarily be distorted. When advances are subtle\nor complicated, scientists should be willing to go the extra distance to give proper\nexplanations and the public should be more patient about the truth. Even so, some\ndifficulties are unavoidable. Most developments reflect work in progress, so the story is\ncomplex because no one yet knows the big picture.\n \n3",
