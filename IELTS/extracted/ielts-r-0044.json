  "passage_text": "Reading Practice\n \nAssessing the risk\nA\nAs a title for a supposedly unprejudiced debate on scientific progress, “Panic attack:\ninterrogating our obsession with risk” did not bode well. Held last week at the Royal\nInstitution in London, the event brought together scientists from across the world to ask\nwhy society is so obsessed with risk and to call for a “more rational” approach. “We seem\nto be organising society around the grandmotherly maxim of ‘better safe than sorry’,”\nexclaimed Spiked, the online publication that organised the event. “What are the\nconsequences of this overbearing concern with risks?”\nB\nThe debate was preceded by a survey of 40 scientists who were invited to describe how\nawful our lives would be if the “precautionary principle” had been allowed to prevail in the\npast. Their response was: no heart surgery or antibiotics, and hardly any drugs at all; no\naeroplanes, bicycles or high-voltage power grids; no pasteurisation, pesticides or\nbiotechnology; no quantum mechanics; no wheel; no “discovery” of America. In short, their\nmessage was: no risk, no gain.\nC\nThey have absolutely missed the point. The precautionary principle is a subtle idea. It has\nvarious forms, but all of them generally include some notion of cost-effectiveness. Thus the\npoint is not simply to ban things that are not known to be absolutely safe. Rather, it says:\n“Of course you can make no progress without risk. But if there is no obvious gain from\ntaking the risk, then don’t take it.”\nD\nClearly, all the technologies listed by the 40 well-chosen savants were innately risky at their\ninception, as all technologies are. But all of them would have received the green light under\nthe precautionary principle because they all had the potential to offer tremendous benefits\n– the solutions to very big problems – if only the snags could be overcome.\nE\nIf the precautionary principle had been in place, the scientists tell us, we would not have\nantibiotics. But of course, we would – if the version of the principle that sensible people\nnow understand had been applied. When penicillin was discovered in the 1920s, infective\nbacteria were laying waste to the world. Children died from diphtheria and whooping cough,\nevery open-drain brought the threat of typhoid, and any wound could lead to septicaemia\nand even gangrene.\nF\nPenicillin was turned into a practical drug during the Second World War when the many\npestilences that result from were threatened to kill more people than the bombs. Of course\nantibiotics were a priority. Of course, the risks, such as they could be perceived, were\nworth taking.\n \n1\n\nG\nAnd so with the other items on the scientists’ list: electric light bulbs, blood transfusions.\nCAT scans, knives, the measles vaccine – the precautionary principle would have\nprevented all of them, they tell us. But this is just plain wrong. If the precautionary principle\nhad been applied properly, all these creations would have passed muster, because all\noffered incomparable advantages compared to the risks perceived at the time.\nH\nAnother issue is at stake here. Statistics are not the only concept people use when\nweighing up risk. Human beings, subtle and evolved creatures that we are, do not survive\nto three-score years and ten simply by thinking like pocket calculators. A crucial issue is the\nconsumer’s choice. In deciding whether to pursue the development of new technology, the\nconsumer’s right to choose should be considered alongside considerations of risk and\nbenefit. Clearly, skiing is more dangerous than genetically modified tomatoes. But people\nwho ski choose to do so; they do not have skiing thrust upon them by portentous experts of\nthe kind who now feel they have the right to reconstruct our crops. Even with skiing, there\nis the matter of cost-effectiveness to consider: skiing, I am told, is exhilarating. Where is the\nexhilaration in GM soya?\nI\nIndeed, in contrast to all the other items on Spiked’s list, GM crops stand out as an\nexample of a technology whose benefits are far from clear. Some of the risks can at least\nbe defined. But in the present economic climate, the benefits that might accrue from them\nseem dubious. Promoters of GM crops believe that the future population of the world\ncannot be fed without them. That is untrue. The crops that really matter are wheat and rice,\nand there is no GM research in the pipeline that will seriously affect the yield of either. GM\nis used to make production cheaper and hence more profitable, which is an extremely\nquestionable ambition.\nJ\nThe precautionary principle provides the world with a very important safeguard. If it had\nbeen in place in the past it might, for example, have prevented insouciant miners from\npolluting major rivers with mercury. We have come to a sorry pass when scientists, who\nshould above all be dispassionate scholars, feel they should misrepresent such a principle\nfor the purposes of commercial and political propaganda. People at large continue to\nmistrust science and the high technologies it produces partly because they doubt the\nwisdom of scientists. On such evidence as this, these doubts are fully justified.\n \n2",
