  "passage_text": "Reading Practice\n \n \n \nAnts Could Teach Ants\n \nThe ants are tiny and usually nest between rocks in the south coast of England.\nTransformed into research subjects at the University of Bristol, they raced along a tabletop\nforaging for food -and then, remarkably, returned to guide others. Time and again, followers\ntrailed behind leaders, darting this way and that along the route, presumably to memorize\nland- marks. Once a follower got its bearings, it tapped the leader with its antennae,\nprompting the lesson to literally proceed to the next step. The ants were only looking for\nfood but the researchers said the careful way the leaders led followers -thereby turning\nthem into leaders in their own right -marked the Temnothorax albipennis ant as the very\nfirst example of a non-human animal exhibiting teaching behavior.\n\"Tandem running is an example of teaching, to our knowledge the first in a non-human\nanimal, that involves bidirectional feedback between teacher and pupil,\" remarks Nigel\nFranks, professor of animal behavior and ecology, whose paper on the ant educators was\npublished last week in the journal Nature.\nNo sooner was the paper published, of course, than another educator questioned it. Marc\nHauser, a psychologist and biologist and one of the scientists who came up with the\ndefinition of teaching, said it was unclear whether the ants had learned a new skill or\nmerely acquired new information.\nLater, Franks took a further study and found that there were even races between leaders.\nWith the guidance of leaders, ants could find food faster. But the help comes at a cost for\nthe leader, who normally would have reached the food about four times faster if not\nhampered by a follower. This means the hypothesis that the leaders deliberately slowed\ndown in order to pass the skills on to the followers seems potentially valid. His ideas were\nadvocated by the students who carried out the video project with him.\nOpposing views still arose, however. Hauser noted that mere communication of information\nis commonplace in the animal world. Consider a species, for example, that uses alarm calls\nto warn fellow members about the presence of a predator. Sounding the alarm can be\ncostly, because the animal may draw the attention of the predator to itself. But it allows\nothers to flee to safety. “Would you call this teaching?” wrote Hauser. “The caller incurs a\ncost. The naive animals gain a benefit and new knowledge that better enables them to\nlearn about the predator’s location than if the caller had not called. This happens\nthroughout the animal kingdom, but we don’t call it teaching, even though it is clearly\ntransfer of information.”\nTim Caro, a zoologist, presented two cases of animal communication. He found that\ncheetah mothers that take their cubs along on hunts gradually allow their cubs to do more\nof the hunting -going, for example, from killing a gazelle and allowing young cubs to eat to\nmerely tripping the gazelle and letting the cubs finish it off. At one level, such behavior\nmight be called teaching -except the mother was not really teaching the cubs to hunt but\nmerely facilitating various stages of learning. In another instance, birds watching other birds\nusing a stick to locate food such as insects and so on, are observed to do the same thing\nthemselves while finding food later.\nPsychologists study animal behavior in part to understand the evolutionary roots of human\nbehavior, Hauser said. The challenge in understanding whether other animals truly teach\n \n1\n\none another, he added, is that human teaching involves a “theory of mind” -teachers are\naware that students don’t know something. He questioned whether Franks’s leader ants\nreally knew that the follower ants were ignorant. Could they simply have been following an\ninstinctive rule to proceed when the followers tapped them on the legs or abdomen? And\ndid leaders that led the way to food -only to find that it had been removed by the\nexperimenter -incur the wrath of followers? That, Hauser said, would suggest that the\nfollower ant actually knew the leader was more knowledgeable and not merely following an\ninstinctive routine itself.\nThe controversy went on, and for a good reason. The occurrence of teaching in ants, if\nproven to be true, indicates that teaching can evolve in animals with tiny brains. It is\nprobably the value of information in social animals that determines when teaching will\nevolve rather than the constraints of brain size.\nBennett Galef Jr., a psychologist who studies animal behavior and social learning at\nMcMaster University in Canada, maintained that ants were unlikely to have a “theory of\nmind” -meaning that leader and followers may well have been following instinctive routines\nthat were not based on an understanding of what was happening in another ant’s brain. He\nwarned that scientists may be barking up the wrong tree when they look not only for\nexamples of humanlike behavior among other animals but humanlike thinking that\nunderlies such behavior. Animals may behave in ways similar to humans without a similar\ncognitive system, he said, so the behavior is not necessarily a good guide into how humans\ncame to think the way they do.\n \n2",
