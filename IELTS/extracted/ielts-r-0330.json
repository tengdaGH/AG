  "passage_text": "Reading Practice\n \nPacific navigation and voyaging\nHow people migrated to the Pacific islands\nThe many tiny islands of the Pacific Ocean had no human population until ancestors of\ntoday’s islanders sailed from Southeast Asia in ocean-going canoes approximately 2,000\nyears ago. At the present time, the debate continues about exactly how they migrated such\nvast distances across the ocean, without any of the modern technologies we take for\ngranted.\nAlthough the romantic vision of some early twentieth-century writers of fleets of heroic\nnavigators simultaneously setting sail had come to be considered by later investigators to\nbe exaggerated, no considered assessment of Pacific voyaging was forthcoming until 1956\nwhen the American historian Andrew Sharp published his research. Sharp challenged the\n‘heroic vision’ by asserting that the expertise of the navigators was limited, and that the\nsettlement of the islands was not systematic, being more dependent on good fortune by\ndrifting canoes. Sharp’s theory was widely challenged, and deservedly so. If nothing else,\nhowever, it did spark renewed interest in the topic and precipitated valuable new research.\nSince the 1960s a wealth of investigations has been conducted, and most of them,\nthankfully, have been of the ‘non-armchair’ variety. While it would be wrong to denigrate all\n‘armchair’ research - that based on an examination of available published materials - it has\nturned out that so little progress had been made in the area of Pacific voyaging because\nmost writers relied on the same old sources - travelers’ journals or missionary narratives\ncompiled by unskilled observers. After Sharp, this began to change, and researchers\nconducted most of their investigations not in libraries, but in the field.\nIn 1965, David Lewis, a physician and experienced yachtsman, set to work using his own\nunique philosophy: he took the yacht he had owned for many years and navigated through\nthe islands in order to contact those men who still find their way at sea using traditional\nmethods. He then accompanied these men, in their traditional canoes, on test voyages\nfrom which all modern instruments were banished from sight, though Lewis secretly used\nthem to confirm the navigator’s calculations. His most famous such voyage was a return\ntrip of around 1,000 nautical miles between two islands in midocean. Far from drifting, as\nproposed by Sharp, Lewis found that ancient navigators would have known which course to\nsteer by memorizing which stars rose and set in certain positions along the horizon and this\ngave them fixed directions by which to steer their boats.\nThe geographer Edwin Doran followed a quite different approach. He was interested in\nobtaining exact data on canoe sailing performance, and to that end employed the latest\nelectronic instrumentation. Doran traveled on board traditional sailing canoes in some of\nthe most remote parts of the Pacific, all the while using his instruments to record canoe\nspeeds in different wind strengths - from gales to calms - the angle canoes could sail\nrelative to the wind. In the process, he provided the first really precise attributes of\ntraditional sailing canoes.\nA further contribution was made by Steven Horvath. As a physiologist, Horvath’s interest\nwas not in navigation techniques or in canoes, but in the physical capabilities of the men\nthemselves. By adapting standard physiological techniques, Horvath was able to calculate\nthe energy expenditure required to paddle canoes of this sort at times when there was no\n \n1\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nwind to fill the sails, or when the wind was contrary. He concluded that paddles, or perhaps\nlong oars, could indeed have propelled for long distances what were primarily sailing\nvessels.\n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \nFinally, a team led by p Wall Garrard conducted important research, in this case by making\ninvestigations while remaining safely in the laboratory. Wall Garrard’s unusual method was\nto use the findings of linguists who had studied the languages of the Pacific islands, many\nof which are remarkably similar although the islands where they are spoken are sometimes\nthousands of kilometres apart. Clever adaptation of computer simulation techniques\npioneered in other disciplines allowed him to produce convincing models suggesting the\nmigrations were indeed systematic, but not simultaneous. Wall Garrard proposed the\nmigrations should be seen not as a single journey made by a massed fleet of canoes, but\nas a series of ever more ambitious voyages, each pushing further into the unknown ocean.\nWhat do we learn about Pacific navigation and voyaging from this research? Quite\ncorrectly, none of the researchers tried to use their findings to prove one theory or another;\nexperiments such as these cannot categorically confirm or negate a hypothesis. The\nstrength of this research lay in the range of methodologies employed. When we splice\ntogether these findings we can propose that traditional navigators used a variety of canoe\ntypes, sources of water and navigation techniques, and it was this adaptability which was\ntheir greatest accomplishment. These navigators observed the conditions prevailing at sea\nat the time a voyage was made and altered their techniques accordingly. Furthermore, the\ncanoes of the navigators were not drifting helplessly at sea but were most likely part of a\nsystematic migration; as such, the Pacific peoples were able to view the ocean as an\navenue, not a barrier, to communication before any other race on Earth. Finally, one\nunexpected but most welcome consequence of this research has been a renaissance in\nthe practice of traditional voyaging. In some groups of islands in the Pacific today young\npeople are resurrecting the skills of their ancestors, when a few decades ago it seemed\nthey would be lost forever.\n \n2",
