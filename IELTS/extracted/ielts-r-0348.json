  "passage_text": "Reading Practice\n \nPsychology and personality ASSESSMENT\nA\nOur daily lives are largely made up of contacts with other people, during which we are\nconstantly making judgments of their personalities and accommodating our behaviour to\nthem in accordance with these judgments. A casual meeting of neighbours on the street,\nan employer giving instructions to an employee, a mother telling her children how to\nbehave, a journey in a train where strangers eye one another without exchanging a word –\nall these involve mutual interpretations of personal qualities.\nB\nSuccess in many vocations largely depends on skill in sizing up people. It is important not\nonly to such professionals as the clinical psychologist, the psychiatrist or the social worker,\nbut also to the doctor or lawyer in dealing with their clients, the businessman trying to\noutwit his rivals, the salesman with potential customers, the teacher with his pupils, not to\nspeak of the pupils judging their teacher. Social life, indeed, would be impossible if we did\nnot. to some extent, understand, and react to the motives and qualities of those we meet;\nand clearly we are sufficiently accurate for most practical purposes, although we also\nrecognize that misinterpretations easily arise – particularly on the pare of others who judge\nus!\nC\nErrors can often be corrected as we go along. But whenever we are pinned down to a\ndefinite decision about a person, which cannot easily be revised through his ‘feed-back’,\nthe Inadequacies of our judgments become apparent. The hostess who wrongly thinks that\nthe Smiths and the Joneses will get on well together can do little to retrieve the success of\nher party. A school or a business may be saddled for years with an undesirable member of\nstaff, because the selection committee which interviewed him for a quarter of an hour\nmisjudged his personality.\nD\nJust because the process is so familiar and taken for granted, It has aroused little scientific\ncuriosity until recently. Dramatists, writers and artists throughout the centuries have\nexcelled in the portrayal of character, but have seldom stopped to ask how they, or we, get\nto know people, or how accurate is our knowledge. However, the popularity of such\nunscientific systems as Lavater’s physiognomy in the eighteenth century, Gall’s phrenology\nin the nineteenth, and of handwriting interpretations by graphologists, or palm-readings by\nGypsies, show that people are aware of weaknesses in their judgments and desirous of\nbetter methods of diagnosis. It is natural that they should turn to psychology for help, in the\nbelief that psychologists are specialists in ‘human nature’.\nE\nThis belief is hardly justified: for the primary aim of psychology had been to establish the\ngeneral laws and principles underlying behaviour and thinking, rather than to apply these to\nconcrete problems of the individual person. A great many professional psychologists still\nregard it as their main function to study the nature of learning, perception and motivation in\n \n1\n\nthe abstracted or average human being, or in lower organisms, and consider it premature\nto put so young a science to practical uses. They would disclaim the possession of any\nsuperior skill in judging their fellow-men. Indeed, being more aware of the difficulties than is\nthe non-psychologist, they may be more reluctant to commit themselves to definite\npredictions or decisions about other people. Nevertheless, to an increasing extent\npsychologists are moving into educational, occupational, clinical and other applied fields,\nwhere they are called upon to use their expertise for such purposes as fitting the education\nor job to the child or adult,and the person to the job,Thus a considerable proportion of their\nactivities consists of personality assessment.\nF\nThe success of psychologists in personality assessment has been limited, in comparison\nwith what they have achieved in the fields of abilities and training, with the result that most\npeople continue to rely on unscientific methods of assessment. In recent times there has\nbeen a tremendous amount of work on personality tests, and on carefully controlled\nexperimental studies of personality. Investigations of personality by Freudian and other\n‘depth’ psychologists have an even longer history. And yet psychology seems to be no\nnearer to providing society with practicable techniques which are sufficiently reliable and\naccurate to win general acceptance. The soundness of the methods of psychologists in the\nfield of personality assessment and the value of their work are under constant fire from\nother psychologists, and it is far from easy to prove their worth.\nG\nThe growth of psychology has probably helped responsible members of society to become\nmore aware of the difficulties of assessment. But it is not much use telling employers,\neducationists and judges how inaccurately they diagnose the personalities with which they\nhave to deal unless psychologists are sure that they can provide something better. Even\nwhen university psychologists themselves appoint a new member of staff, they almost\nalways resort to the traditional techniques of assessing the candidates through interviews,\npast records, and testimonials, and probably make at least as many bad appointments as\nother employers do. However, a large amount of experimental development of better\nmethods has been carried out since 1940 by groups of psychologists in the Armed\nServices and in the Civil Service, and by such organizations as the (British) National\nInstitute of Industrial Psychology and the American Institute of Research.\n \n2",
