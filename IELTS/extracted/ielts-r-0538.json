  "passage_text": "Reading Practice\nThe reconstruction of community in Talbot Park,\nAuckland\n \nA. An architecture of disguise is almost complete at Talbot Park in the heart of Auckland’s\nGlen Innes. The place was once described as a state housing ghetto, rife with crime,\nvandalism and other social problems. But today after a $48 million urban renewal\nmakeover, the site is home to 700 residents — 200 more than before — and has people\nregularly inquiring whether they can buy or rent there. “It doesn’t look like social housing,”\nHousing New Zealand housing services manager Dene Busby says of the tidy brick and\nweatherboard apartments and townhouses which would look just as much at home in\n“there is no reason why public housing should look cheap in my view,” says Design Group\narchitect Neil of the eight three-bedroom terrace houses his firm designed.\nB. Talbot Park is a triangle of government-owned land bounded by Apirana Ave, Pilkington\nRd and Point England Rd. In the early 1960s it was developed for state housing built\naround a linear park that ran through the middle. Initially, there was a strong sense of a\nfamily-friendly community. Former residents recall how the Talbot Park reserve played a\nbig part in their childhoods — a place where the kids in the block came together to play\nsoftball, cricket, tiggy, leapfrog and bullrush. Sometimes they’d play “Maoris against\nPakehas” but without any animosity. “It was all just good fun”, says Georgie Thompson in\nBen Schrader’s We Call it Home: A History of State Housing in New Zealand. “We had\nrespect for our neighbours and addressed them by title Mr. and Mrs. soand-so,” she\nrecalls.\nC. Quite what went wrong with Talbot Park is not clear. We call it Home Records that the\ncommunity began to change in the late 1970s as more Pacific Islanders and Europeans\nmoved in. The new arrivals didn’t readily integrate with the community, a “them and us”\nmentality developed, and residents interacted with their neighbours less. What was clear\nwas the buildings were deteriorating and becoming dilapidated, petty crime was on the rise\nand the reserve — focus of fond childhood memories — had become a wasteland and was\nconsidered unsafe.\nD. But it wasn’t until 2002 that Housing New Zealand decided the properties needed\nupgrading. The master renewal plan didn’t take advantage of the maximum\naccommodation density allowable (one unit per 100 sq metres ) but did increase density to\none emit per 180 sq m by refurbishing all 108 star flat units, removing the multis and\nbuilding 111 new home. The Talbot strategy can be summed up as mix, match and\nmanage. Mix up the housing with variety plans from a mix of architects, match house styles\nto what7 s built by the private sector, match tenants to the mix, and manage their\noccupancy. Inevitably cost comes into the equation.” If you’re going to build low cost\nhomes, you’ve got to keep them simple and you can’t afford a fancy bit on them. ” says\nMichael Thompson of Architectus which designed the innovative threelevel Atrium\napartments lining two sides of a covered courtyard. At $300,000 per two bedroom unit, the\nbuilding is more expensive but provides for independent disabled accommodation as well\n \n1\n\n \nas offering solar hot water heating and rainwater collection for toilet cisterns and outside\ntaps.\nE. The renewal project budget at $1.5 million which will provide park pathways, planting,\nplaygrounds, drinking fountains, seating, skateboard rails, a half-size basketball hard court,\nand a pavilion. But if there was any doubt this is a low socio-economic area, the\ndemographics for the surrounding Tamaki area are sobering. Of the 5000 households\nthere, 55 percent are state houses, 28 per cent privately owned (compared to about 65\npercent nationally) and 17 percent are private rental. The area has a high concentration of\nhouseholds with incomes in the $5000 to $15,000 range and very few with an income over\n$70,000. That’s in sharp contrast to the more affluent suburbs like Kohimarama and St\nJohn’s that surround the area.\nF. “The design is for people with different culture background,” says architect James\nLunday of Common Ground which designed the 21 large family homes. “Architecturally we\ndecided to be relatively conservative — nice house in its own garden with a bit of space\nand good indoor outdoor flow.” There’s a slight reflection of the whare and a Pacific fale,\nbut not overplayed “The private sector is way behind in urban design and sustainable\nfutures,” says Bracey. “Redesigning sheets and parks is a big deal and very difficult to do.\nThe private sector won’t do it, because It’s so hard.”\nG. There’s no doubt good urban design and good architecture play a significant part in the\nscheme. But probably more important is a new standard of social control. Housing New\nZealand calls it “intensive tenancy management”. Others view it as social engineering. “It’s\na model that we are looking at going forward,” according to Housing New Zealand’s central\nAuckland regional manager Graham Bodman.1 The focus is on frequent inspections,\nhelping tenants to get to know each other and trying to create an environment of respect for\nneighbours, ” says Bodman. That includes some strict rules — no loud parties after 10 pm,\nno dogs, no cats in the apartments, no washing hung over balcony rails and a requirement\nto mow lawns and keep the property tidy. Housing New Zealand has also been active in\norganising morning teas and sheet barbecues for residents to meet their neighbours. “IVs\nall based on the intensification,” says Community Renewal project manager Stuart Bracey.\n“We acknowledge if you are going to put more people living closer together, you have to\nactually help them to live closer together because it creates tension — especially for people\nthat aren’t used to it.”\n \n2",
