It has been suggested that the swarms of feral pigeons are all descended from\nbirds which escaped from dovecotes in the early medieval period; they found a natural\nhabitat in the crannies and ledges of buildings as did their ancestors, the rock doves, amid\nthe sea-girt cliffs. ‘They nest in small colonies,’ one observer has written, ‘usually high up\nand inaccessible’ above the streets of London as if the streets were indeed a sea. A man\nfell from the belfry of St Stephens Walbrook in 1277 while in quest of a pigeon’s nest, while\nthe Bishop of London complained in 1385 of ‘malignant persons’ who threw stones at the\npigeons resting in the city churches. So pigeons were already a familiar presence, even if\nthey were not treated with the same indulgence as their more recent successors. A\nmodicum of kindness to these creatures seems to have been first shown in the late\nnineteenth century, when they were fed oats rather than the customary stale bread.\nFrom the end of the nineteenth century, wood pigeons also migrated into the city; they\nwere quickly urbanised, increasing both in numbers and in tameness. ‘We have frequently\nseen them on die roofs of houses,’ wrote the author of Bird Life in London in 1893,\napparently as much at home as any dovecote pigeon.’ Those who look up today may\nnotice their ‘fly-lines’ in the sky. from Lincoln’s Inn Fields over Kingsway and Trafalgar\nSquare to Battersea, with other lines to Victoria Park and to Kenwood. The air of London is\nfilled with such ‘fly-lines’, and to trace the paths of the birds would be to envisage the city in\nan entirely different form; then it would seem linked and unified by thousands of\nthoroughfares and small paths of energy, each with its own history of use.\nThe sparrows move quickly in public places, and they arc now so much part of London\nthat they have been adopted by the native population as the sparred; a friend was known to\nCockneys as a ‘cocksparrer’ in tribute to a bird which is sweet and yet watchful, blessed\nwith a dusky plumage similar to that of the London dust, a plucky little bird darting in and\nout of the city’s endless uproar. They are small birds which can lose body heat very quickly,\nso they are perfectly adapted to the ‘heat island’ of London. They will live in any small\ncranny or cavity, behind drainpipes or ventilation shafts, or in public statues, or holes in\nbuildings; in that sense diet are perfectly suited to a London topography. An ornithologist\nwho described the sparrow as peculiarly attached to man’ said it never now breeds at any\ndistance from an occupied building’. This sociability, bred upon the fondness of the\nLondoner, is manifest in many ways. One naturalist, W.H. Hudson, has described how any\nstranger in a green space or public garden will soon find that ‘several sparrows are keeping\nhim company … watching his every movement, and if he sits down on a chair or a bench\nseveral of them will come close to him, and hop this way and that before him, uttering a\nlittle plaintive note of interrogation — Have you got nothing for us? They have also been\ndescribed as die urchins of the streets — ‘thievish, self-assertive and pugnacious’ — a\ncondition which again may merit the attention and admiration of native Londoners.\nRemarkably attached to their surroundings, they rarely create ‘fly-lines’ across the city;\nwhere they are born, like other Londoners, they stay.\nThere are some birds, such as the robin and the chaffinch, which are less approachable\nand trustful in the city than in the country. Other species, such as the mallard, grow\nincreasingly shyer as they leave London. There has been a severe diminution of the\n \n1\n\nnumber of sparrows, while blackbirds are more plentiful. Swans and ducks have also\nincreased in number. Some species, however, have all but vanished. The rooks of London\nare, perhaps, the most notable of the disappeared, their rookeries destroyed by building\nwork or by tree-felling.

The burial ground of St Deinstalls in the East and the college garden of\nthe Ecclesiastical Court in Doctors’ Commons, the turrets of the Tower of London and the\ngardens of Grays Inn, were once such localities.
