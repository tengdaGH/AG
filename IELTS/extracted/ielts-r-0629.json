For the better\npart of a century, most biologists have been reluctant to use those words, mindful of a\nprinciple of evolution that says ‘evolution cannot run backwards. But as more and more\nexamples come to light and modern genetics enters the scene, that principle is having to\nbe rewritten. Not only are evolutionary throwbacks possible, they sometimes play an\nimportant role in the forward march of evolution.                                                           \nThe technical term for an evolutionary throwback is an ‘atavism’, from the Latin atavus,\nmeaning forefather. The word has ugly connotations thanks largely to Cesare Lombroso, a\n19th-century Italian medic who argued that criminals were born not made and could be\nidentified by certain physical features that were throwbacks to a primitive, sub-human state.\nWhile Lombroso was measuring criminals, a Belgian palaeontologist called Louis Dollo was\nstudying fossil records and coming to the opposite conclusion. In 1890 he proposed that\nevolution was irreversible: that ‘an organism is unable to return, even partially, to a\nprevious stage already realised in the ranks of its ancestors. Early 20th-century biologists\ncame to a similar conclusion, though they qualified it in terms of probability, stating that\nthere is no reason why evolution cannot run backwards -it is just very unlikely. And so the\nidea of irreversibility in evolution stuck and came to be known as ‘Dollo’s law.\nIf Dollo’s law is right, atavisms should occur only very rarely, if at all. Yet almost since the\nidea took root, exceptions have been cropping up. In 1919, for example, a humpback whale\nwith a pair of leglike appendages over a metre long, complete with a full set of limb bones,\nwas caught off Vancouver Island in Canada. Explorer Roy Chapman Andrews argued at\nthe time that the whale must be a throwback to a land-living ancestor. ‘I can see no other\nexplanation, he wrote in 1921.\nSince then, so many other examples have been discovered that it no longer makes sense\nto say that evolution is as good as irreversible. And this poses a puzzle: how can\ncharacteristics that disappeared millions of years ago suddenly reappear?\nIn 1994, Rudolf Raff and colleagues at Indiana University in the USA decided to use\ngenetics to put a number on the probability of evolution going into reverse. They reasoned\nthat while some evolutionary changes involve the loss of genes and are therefore\nirreversible, others may be the result of genes being switched off. If these silent genes are\nsomehow switched back on, they argued, longlost traits could reappear.\nRaff’s team went on to calculate the likelihood of it happening. Silent genes accumulate\nrandom mutations, they reasoned, eventually rendering them useless. So how long can a\ngene survive in a species if it is no longer used? The team calculated that there is a good\nchance of silent genes surviving for up to 6 million years in at least a few individuals in a\npopulation, and that some might survive as long as 10 million years. In other words,\nthrowbacks are possible, but only to the relatively recent evolutionary past.\nAs a possible example, the team pointed to the mole salamanders of Mexico and\nCalifornia. Like most amphibians these begin life in a juvenile ‘tadpole’ state, then\nmetamorphose into the adult form – except for one species, the axolotl, which famously\n \n1\n\nlives its entire life as a juvenile. The simplest explanation for this is that the axolotl lineage\nalone lost the ability to metamorphose, while others retained it. From a detailed analysis of\nthe salamanders’ family tree, however, it is clear that the other lineages evolved from an\nancestor that itself had lost the ability to metamorphose. In other words, metamorphosis in\nmole salamanders is an atavism. The salamander example fits with Raff’s 10million-year\ntime frame.\nMore recently, however, examples have been reported that break the time limit, suggesting\nthat silent genes may not be the whole story. In a paper published last year, biologist\nGunter Wagner of Yale University reported some work on the evolutionary history of a\ngroup of South American lizards called Bachia. Many of these have minuscule limbs; some\nlook more like snakes than lizards and a few have completely lost the toes on their hind\nlimbs. Other species, however, sport up to four toes on their hind legs. The simplest\nexplanation is that the toed lineages never lost their toes, but Wagner begs to differ.\nAccording to his analysis of the Bachia family tree, the toed species re-evolved toes from\ntoeless ancestors and, what is more, digit loss and gain has occurred on more than one\noccasion over tens of millions of years.\nSo what’s going on? One possibility is that these traits are lost and then simply reappear, in\nmuch the same way that similar structures can independently arise in unrelated species,\nsuch as the dorsal fins of sharks and killer whales. Another more intriguing possibility is\nthat the genetic information needed to make toes somehow survived for tens or perhaps\nhundreds of millions of years in the lizards and was reactivated. These atavistic traits\nprovided an advantage and spread through the population, effectively reversing evolution.\nBut if silent genes degrade within 6 to million years, how can long-lost traits be reactivated\nover longer timescales? The answer may lie in the womb. Early embryos of many species\ndevelop ancestral features. Snake embryos, for example, sprout hind limb buds. Later in\ndevelopment these features disappear thanks to developmental programs that say ‘lose the\nleg’. If for any reason this does not happen, the ancestral feature may not disappear,\nleading to an atavism. \n \n2",
