  "passage_text": "Reading Practice\n \nYoung children's sense of identity\nA\nA sense of self develops in young children by degrees. The process can usefully be\nthought of in terms of the gradual emergence of two somewhat separate features: the self\nas a subject, and the self as an object. William James introduced the distinction in 1892,\nand contemporaries of his, such as Charles Cooley, added to the developing debate. Ever\nsince then psychologists have continued building on the theory.\nB\nAccording to James, a child's first step on the road to self-understanding can be seen as\nthe recognition that he or she exists. This is an aspect of the self that he labelled 'self-as-\nsubject', and he gave it various elements. These included an awareness of one's own\nagency (i.e. one's power to act), and an awareness of one's distinctiveness from other\npeople. These features gradually emerge as infants explore their world and interact with\ncaregivers. Cooley (1902) suggested that a sense of the self-as-subject was primarily\nconcerned with being able to exercise power. He proposed that the earliest examples of\nthis are an infant's attempts to control physical objects, such as toys or his or her own\nlimbs. This is followed by attempts to affect the behaviour of other people. For example,\ninfants learn that when they cry or smile someone responds to them.\nC\nAnother powerful source of information for infants about the effects they can have on the\nworld around them is provided when others mimic them. Many parents spend a lot of time,\nparticularly in the early months, copying their infant's vocalizations and expressions. In\naddition, young children enjoy looking in mirrors, where the movements they can see are\ndependent upon their own movements.\nThis is not to say that infants recognize the reflection as their own image (a later\ndevelopment). However, Lewis and Brooks-Gunn (1979) suggest that infants' developing\nunderstanding that the movements they see in the mirror are contingent on their own, leads\nto a growing awareness that they are distinct from other people. This is because they, and\nonly they, can change the reflection in the mirror.\nD\nThis understanding that children gain of themselves as active agents continues to develop\nin their attempts to co-operate with others in play. Dunn (1988) points out that it is in such\nday-to-day relationships and interactions that the child's understanding of his- or herself\nemerges. Empirical investigations of the self-as-subject in young children are, however,\nrather scarce because of difficulties of communication: even if young infants can reflect on\ntheir experience, they certainly cannot express this aspect of the self directly.\nE\nOnce children have acquired a certain level of self-awareness, they begin to place\nthemselves in a whole series of categories, which together play such an important part in\ndefining them uniquely as 'themselves'. This second step in the development of a full sense\n \n1\n\nof self is what James called the 'self-as-object'. This has been seen by many to be the\naspect of the self which is most influenced by social elements, since it is made up of social\nroles (such as student, brother, colleague) and characteristics which derive their meaning\nfrom comparison or interaction with other people (such as trustworthiness, shyness,\nsporting ability).\nF\nCooley and other researchers suggested a close connection between a person's own\nunderstanding of their identity and other people's understanding of it. Cooley believed that\npeople build up their sense of identity from the reactions of others to them, and from the\nview they believe others have of them. He called the self-as-object the 'looking-glass self',\nsince people come to see themselves as they are reflected in others. Mead (1934) went\neven further, and saw the self and the social world as inextricably bound together: 'The self\nis essentially a social structure, and it arises in social experience ... it is impossible to\nconceive of a self arising outside of social experience.'\nG\nLewis and Brooks-Gunn argued that an important developmental milestone is reached\nwhen children become able to recognize themselves visually without the support of seeing\ncontingent movement. This recognition occurs around their second birthday. In one\nexperiment, Lewis and Brooks-Gunn (1979) dabbed some red powder on the noses of\nchildren who were playing in front of a mirror, and then observed how often they touched\ntheir noses. The psychologists reasoned that if the children knew what they usually looked\nlike, they would be surprised by the unusual red mark and would start touching it. On the\nother hand, they found that children of 15 to 18 months are generally not able to recognize\nthemselves unless other cues such as movement are present.\nH\nFinally, perhaps the most graphic expressions of self-awareness in general can be seen in\nthe displays of rage which are most common from 18 months to 3 years of age. In a\nlongitudinal study of groups of three or four children, Bronson (1975) found that the\nintensity of the frustration and anger in their disagreements increased sharply between the\nages of 1 and 2 years. Often, the children's disagreements involved a struggle over a toy\nthat none of them had played with before or after the tug-of-war: the children seemed to be\ndisputing ownership rather than wanting to play with it. Although it may be less marked in\nother societies, the link between the sense of 'self' and of 'ownership' is a notable feature of\nchildhood in Western societies.\n \n2",
