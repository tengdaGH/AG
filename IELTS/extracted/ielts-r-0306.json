  "passage_text": "Reading Practice\n \nNature or Nurture?\nA\nA few years ago, in one of the most fascinating and disturbing experiments in behavioural\npsychology, Stanley Milgram of Yale University tested 40 subjects from all walks of life for\ntheir willingness to obey instructions given by a ‘leader’ in a situation in which the subjects\nmight feel a personal distaste for the actions they were called upon to perform. Specifically,\nMilgram told each volunteer 'teacher-subject' that the experiment was in the noble cause of\neducation, and was designed to test whether or not punishing pupils for their mistakes\nwould have a positive effect on the pupils' ability to learn.\nB\nMilgram’s experimental set-up involved placing the teacher-subject before a panel of thirty\nswitches with labels ranging from '15 volts of electricity (slight shock)' to ‘450 volts (danger\n- severe shock)' in steps of 15 volts each. The teacher-subject was told that whenever the\npupil gave the wrong answer to a question, a shock was to be administered, beginning at\nthe lowest level and increasing in severity with each successive wrong answer. The\nsupposed 'pupil' was in reality an actor hired by Milgram to simulate receiving the shocks\nby emitting a spectrum of groans, screams and writhings together with an assortment of\nstatements and expletives denouncing both the experiment and the experimenter. Milgram\ntold the teacher-subject to ignore the reactions of the pupil, and to administer whatever\nlevel of shock was called for. as per the rule governing the experimental situation of the\nmoment.\nC\nAs the experiment unfolded, the pupil would deliberately give the wrong answers\nto questions posed by the teacher, thereby bringing on various electrical punishments,\neven up to the danger level of 300 volts and beyond. Many of the teacher-subjects balked\nat administering the higher levels of punishment, and turned to Milgram with questioning\nlocks and/or complaints about continuing the experiment. In these situations, Milgram\ncalmly explained that the teacher-subject was to ignore the pupil's cries for mercy and carry\non with the experiment. If the subject was still reluctant to proceed, Milgram said that it was\nimportant for the sake of the experiment that the procedure be followed through to the end.\nHis final argument was, ‘You have no other choice. You must go on.' What Milgram was\ntrying to discover was the number of teacher-subjects who would be willing to administer\nthe highest levels of shock, even in the face of strong persona! and moral revulsion against\nthe rules and conditions of the experiment.\nD\nPrior to carrying out the experiment, Milgram explained his idea to a group of 39\npsychiatrists and asked them to predict the average percentage of people in an ordinary\npopulation who would be willing to administer the highest shock level of 450 volts. The\noverwhelming consensus was that virtually all the teacher-subjects would refuse to obey\nthe experimenter. The psychiatrists felt that 'most subjects would not go beyond 150 volts'\nand they further anticipated that only four per cent would go up to 300 volts. Furthermore,\nthey thought that only a lunatic fringe of about one in 1.000 would give the highest shock of\n \n1\n\n450 volts.\nE\nWhat were the actual results? Well, over 60 per cent of the teacher-subjects continued to\nobey Milgram up to the 450-volt limit! In repetitions of the experiment in other countries, the\npercentage of obedient teacher-subjects was even higher, reaching 85 per cent in one\ncountry How can we possibly account for this vast discrepancy between what calm,\nrational, knowledgeable people predict in the comfort of their study and what pressured,\nflustered, but cooperative teachers’ actually do in the laboratory of real life?\nF\nOne’s first inclination might be to argue that there must be some sort of built-in animal\naggression instinct that was activated by the experiment, and that Milgram’s teacher-\nsubjects were just following a genetic need to discharge this pent-up primal urge onto the\npupil by administering the electrical shock. A modern hard-core sociobiologist might even\ngo so far as to claim that this aggressive instinct evolved as an advantageous trait, having\nbeen of survival value to our ancestors in their struggle against the hardships of life on the\nplains and in the caves, ultimately finding its way into our genetic make-up as a remnant of\nour ancient animal ways.\nG\nAn alternative to this notion ot genetic programming is to see the teacher-subjects' actions\nas a result of the social environment under which the experiment was carried out. As\nMilgram himself pointed out. Most subjects in the experiment see their behaviour in a larger\ncontext that is benevolent and useful to society - the pursuit of scientific truth. The\npsychological laboratory has a strong claim to legitimacy and evokes trust and confidence\nin those who perform there. An action such as shocking a victim, which in isolation appears\nevil, acquires a completely different meaning when placed in this setting.’\nH\nThus, in this explanation the subject merges his unique personality and personal and moral\ncode with that of larger institutional structures, surrendering individual properties like\nloyalty, self-sacrifice and discipline to the service of malevolent systems of authority.\nI\n \nHere we have two radically different explanations for why so many teacher-subjects were\nwilling to forgo their sense of personal responsibility for the sake of an institutional authority\nfigure. The problem for biologists, psychologists and anthropologists is to sort out which of\nthese two polar explanations is more plausible. This, in essence, is the problem of modem\nsociobiology - to discover the degree to which hard-wired genetic programming dictates, or\nat least strongly biases, the interaction of animals and humans with their environment, that\nis, their behaviour. Put another way. sociobiology is concerned with elucidating the\nbiological basis of all behaviour.\n \n2",
