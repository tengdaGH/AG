  "passage_text": "Reading Practice\n \n \nShould space be explored by robots or by humans?\n \nA The advisability of humans participating directly in space travel continues to cause many\ndebates. There is no doubt that the presence of people on board a space vehicle makes its\ndesign much more complex and challenging, and produces a large increase in costs, since\nsafety requirements are greatly increased, and the technology providing necessities for\nhuman passengers such as oxygen, food water must be guaranteed. Moreover, the\nsystems required are bulky and costly, and their complexity increases for long-duration\nmissions. Meanwhile, advances in electronics and computer science allow increasingly\ncomplex tasks to be entrusted to robots, and unmanned space probes are becoming\nlighter, smaller and more convenient.\nB However, experience has shown that the idea of humans in space is popular with the\npublic. Humans can also be useful; there are many cases when only direct intervention by\nan astronaut or cosmonaut can correct the malfunction of an automatic device. Astronauts\nand cosmonauts have proved that they can adapt to conditions of weightlessness and work\nin space without encountering too many problems, as was seen in the operations to repair\nand to upgrade the Hubble Space Telescope. One human characteristic which is\nparticularly precious in space missions, and which so far is lacking in robots, is the ability to\nperform a great variety of tasks. In addition, robots are not good at reacting to situations\nthey have not been specifically prepared for. This is especially important in the case of\ndeep space missions. While, in the case of the Moon, it is possible for someone on Earth to\n'tele-operate' a robotic device such as a probe, as the two-way link time is only a couple of\nseconds, on Mars the two- way link time is several minutes, so sending instructions from\nEarth is more difficult.\n \nC Many of the promises of artificial intelligence are still far from being fulfilled. The\nconstruction of machines simulating human logical reasoning moves towards ever more\ndistant dates. The more the performance of computers improves, the more we realise how\ndifficult it is to build machines which display logical abilities. In the past it was confidently\npredicted that we would soon have fully automated factories in which all operations were\nperformed without any human intervention, and forecasts of the complete substitution of\nworkers by robots in many production areas were made. Today, these perspectives are\nbeing revised. It seems that all machines, even the smartest ones, must cooperate with\nhumans. Rather than replacing humans, the present need appears to be for an intelligent\nmachine capable of helping a human operator without replacing him or her. The word\n'cobot', from 'collaborative robot', has been invented to designate this type.\n \nD A similar trend is also apparent in the field of space exploration. Tasks which were in the\npast entrusted only to machines are now performed by human beings, sometimes with the\naim of using simpler and less costly devices, sometimes to obtain better performance. In\nmany cases, to involve a person in the control loop is a welcome simplification which may\nlower the cost of a mission without compromising safety. Many operations originally\ndesigned to be performed under completely automatic control can be performed more\nefficiently by astronauts, perhaps helped by their 'cobots'. The human-machine relationship\nmust evolve towards a closer collaboration.\nE One way this could happen is by adopting the Mars Outposts approach, proposed by the\nPlanetary Society. This would involve sending a number of robotic research stations to\n \n1\n\nMars, equipped with permanent communications and navigational systems. They would\nperform research, and establish the infrastructure needed to prepare future landing sites for\nthe exploration of Mars by humans. It has also been suggested that in the most difficult\nenvironments, as on Venus or Jupiter, robots could be controlled by human beings located\nin spaceships which remain in orbit around the planet. In this case the link time for\ncommunication between humans and robots would be far less than it would be from Earth.\nF But if space is to be more than a place to build automatic laboratories or set up industrial\nenterprises in the vicinity of our planet, the presence of humans is essential. They must\nlearn how to voyage through space towards destinations which will be not only scientific\nbases but also places to live. If space is a frontier, that frontier must see the presence of\npeople. So the aim for humankind in the future will be not just the exploration of space, but\nits colonisation. The result of exploring and living in space may be a deep change in the\nviews which humankind has of itself. And this process is already under way. The images of\nEarth taken from the Moon in the Apollo programme have given humankind a new\nconsciousness of its fragility, its smallness, and its unity. These impressions have triggered\na realisation of the need to protect and preserve it, for it is the place in the solar system\nmost suitable for US and above all it is the only place we have, at least for now.\n \n2",
