  "passage_text": "Reading Practice\n \nABSENTEEISM IN NURSING: A LONGITUDINAL STUDY\nAbsence from work is a costly and disruptive problem for any organisation.\nThe cost of absenteeism in Australia has been put at 1.8 million hours per day or $1400\nmillion annually. The study reported here was conducted in the Prince William Hospital in\nBrisbane, Australia, where, prior to this time, few active steps had been taken to measure,\nunderstand or manage the occurrence of absenteeism.\nNursing Absenteeism\nA prevalent attitude amongst many nurses in the group selected for study was that there\nwas no reward or recognition for not utilising the paid sick leave entitlement allowed them\nin their employment conditions. Therefore, they believed they may as well take the days\noff sick or otherwise. Similar attitudes have been noted by James (1989), who noted that\nsick leave is seen by many workers as a right, like annual holiday leave.\nMiller and Norton (1986), in their survey of 865 nursing personnel, found that 73 per cent\nfelt they should be rewarded for not taking sick leave, because some employees always\nused their sick leave. Further, 67 per cent of nurses felt that administration was not\nsympathetic to the problems shift work causes to employees' personal and social lives.\nOnly 53 per cent of the respondents felt that every effort was made to schedule staff fairly.\nIn another longitudinal study of nurses working in two Canadian hospitals, Hacket Bycio\nand Guion (1989) examined the reasons why nurses took absence from work. The most\nfrequent reason stated for absence was minor illness to self. Other causes, in decreasing\norder of frequency, were illness in family, family social function, work to do at home and\nbereavement.\nMethod\nIn an attempt to reduce the level of absenteeism amongst the 250 Registered an Enrolled\nNurses in the present study, the Prince William management introduced three different, yet\npotentially complementary, strategies over 18 months.\nStrategy 1: Non-financial (material) incentives\nWithin the established wage and salary system it was not possible to use hospital funds to\nsupport this strategy. However, it was possible to secure incentives from local businesses,\nincluding free passes to entertainment parks, theatres, restaurants, etc. At the end of each\nroster period, the ward with the lowest absence rate would win the prize.\nStrategy 2 Flexible fair rostering\nWhere possible, staff were given the opportunity to determine their working schedule within\nthe limits of clinical needs.\nStrategy 3: Individual absenteeism and counselling\nEach month, managers would analyse the pattern of absence of staff with excessive sick\nleave (greater than ten days per year for full-time employees). Characteristic patterns of\npotential 'voluntary absenteeism' such as absence before and after days off, excessive\n \n1\n\nweekend and night duty absence and multiple single days off were communicated to all\nward nurses and then, as necessary, followed up by action.\nResults\nAbsence rates for the six months prior to the Incentive scheme ranged from 3.69 per cent\nto 4.32 per cent. In the following six months they ranged between 2.87 per cent and 3.96\nper cent. This represents a 20 per cent improvement. However, analysing the absence\nrates on a year-to-year basis, the overall absence rate was 3.60 per cent in the first year\nand 3.43 per cent in the following year. This represents a 5 per cent decrease from the first\nto the second year of the study. A significant decrease in absence over the two-year period\ncould not be demonstrated.\nDiscussion\nThe non-financial incentive scheme did appear to assist in controlling absenteeism in the\nshort term. As the scheme progressed it became harder to secure prizes and this\ncontributed to the program's losing momentum and finally ceasing. There were mixed\nresults across wards as well. For example, in wards with staff members who had long-term\ngenuine illness, there was little chance of winning, and to some extent the staff on those\nwards were disempowered. Our experience would suggest that the long-term effects of\nincentive awards on absenteeism are questionable.\nOver the time of the study, staff were given a larger degree of control in their rosters. This\nled to significant improvements in communication between managers and staff. A similar\neffect was found from the implementation of the third strategy. Many of the nurses had not\nrealised the impact their behaviour was having on the organisation and their colleagues but\nthere were also staff members who felt that talking to them about their absenteeism was\n'picking' on them and this usually had a negative effect on management—employee\nrelationships.\nConclusion\nAlthough there has been some decrease in absence rates, no single strategy or\ncombination of strategies has had a significant impact on absenteeism per se.\nNotwithstanding the disappointing results, it is our contention that the strategies were not in\nvain. A shared ownership of absenteeism and a collaborative approach to problem solving\nhas facilitated improved cooperation and communication between management and staff. It\nis our belief that this improvement alone, while not tangibly measurable, has increased the\nability of management to manage the effects of absenteeism more effectively since this\nstudy.\nThis article has been adapted and condensed from the article by G.
