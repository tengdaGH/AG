  "passage_text": "Reading Practice\n \nMAKING TIME FOR SCIENCE\nChronobiology might sound a little futuristic - like something from a science fiction novel,\nperhaps - but it’s actually a field of study that concerns one of the oldest processes life on\nthis planet has ever known: short-term rhythms of time and their effect on flora and fauna.\nThis can take many forms. Marine life, for example, is influenced by tidal patterns. Animals\ntend to be active or inactive depending on the position of the sun or moon. Numerous\ncreatures, humans included, are largely diurnal - that is, they like to come out during the\nhours of sunlight. Nocturnal animals, such as bats and possums, prefer to forage by night.\nA third group are known as crepuscular: they thrive in the low- light of dawn and dusk and\nremain inactive at other hours.\nWhen it comes to humans, chronobiologists are interested in what is known as the\ncircadian rhythm. This is the complete cycle our bodies are naturally geared to undergo\nwithin the passage of a twenty-four hour day. Aside from sleeping at night and waking\nduring the day, each cycle involves many other factors such as changes in blood pressure\nand body temperature. Not everyone has an identical circadian rhythm. ‘Night people’, for\nexample, often describe how they find it very hard to operate during the morning, but\nbecome alert and focused by evening. This is a benign variation within circadian rhythms\nknown as a chronotype.\nScientists have limited abilities to create durable modifications of chronobiological\ndemands. Recent therapeutic developments for humans such as artificial light machines\nand melatonin administration can reset our circadian rhythms, for example, but our bodies\ncan tell the difference and health suffers when we breach these natural rhythms for\nextended periods of time. Plants appear no more malleable in this respect; studies\ndemonstrate that vegetables grown in season and ripened on the tree are far higher in\nessential nutrients than those grown in greenhouses and ripened by laser.\nKnowledge of chronobiological patterns can have many pragmatic implications for our day-\nto-day lives. While contemporary living can sometimes appear to subjugate biology - after\nall, who needs circadian rhythms when we have caffeine pills, energy drinks, shift work and\ncities that never sleep? - keeping in synch with our body clock is important.\nThe average urban resident, for example, rouses at the eye-blearing time of 6.04 a.m.,\nwhich researchers believe to be far too early. One study found that even rising at 7.00 a.m.\nhas deleterious effects on health unless exercise is performed for 30 minutes afterward.\nThe optimum moment has been whittled down to 7.22 a.m.; muscle aches, headaches and\nmoodiness were reported to be lowest by participants in the study who awoke then.\nOnce you’re up and ready to go, what then? If you’re trying to shed some extra pounds,\ndieticians are adamant: never skip breakfast. This disorients your circadian rhythm and\nputs your body in starvation mode. The recommended course of action is to follow an\nintense workout with a carbohydrate-rich breakfast; the other way round and weight loss\nresults are not as pronounced.\nMorning is also great for breaking out the vitamins. Supplement absorption by the body is\nnot temporal-dependent, but naturopath Pam Stone notes that the extra boost at breakfast\nhelps us get energised for the day ahead. For improved absorption, Stone suggests pairing\n \n1\n\nsupplements with a food in which they are soluble and steering clear of caffeinated\nbeverages. Finally, Stone warns to take care with storage; high potency is best for\nabsorption, and warmth and humidity are known to deplete the potency of a supplement.\nAfter-dinner espressos are becoming more of a tradition - we have the Italians to thank for\nthat - but to prepare for a good night’s sleep we are better off putting the brakes on caffeine\nconsumption as early as 3 p.m. With a seven hour half-life, a cup of coffee containing 90\nmg of caffeine taken at this hour could still leave 45 mg of caffeine in your nervous system\nat ten o’clock that evening. It is essential that, by the time you are ready to sleep, your body\nis rid of all traces.\nEvenings are important for winding down before sleep; however, dietician Geraldine\nGeorgeou warns that an after-five carbohydrate-fast is more cultural myth than\nchronobiological demand. This will deprive your body of vital energy needs. Overloading\nyour gut could lead to indigestion, though. Our digestive tracts do not shut down for the\nnight entirely, but their work slows to a crawl as our bodies prepare for sleep. Consuming a\nmodest snack should be entirely sufficient.\n \n2",
