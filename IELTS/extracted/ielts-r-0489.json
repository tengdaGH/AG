  "passage_text": "Reading Practice\n \nThe history of glass\nFrom our earliest origins, man has been making use of glass. Historians have discovered\nthat a type of natural glass - obsidian - formed in places such as the mouth of a volcano as\na result of the intense heat of an eruption melting sand - was first used as tips for spears.\nArchaeologists have even found evidence of man-made glass which dates back to 4000\nBC; this took the form of glazes used for coating stone beads. It was not until 1500 BC,\nhowever, that the first hollow glass container was made by covering a sand core with a\nlayer of molten glass.\nGlass blowing became the most common way to make glass containers from the first\ncentury BC. The glass made during this time was highly coloured due to the impurities of\nthe raw material. In the first century AD, methods of creating colourless glass were\ndeveloped, which was then tinted by the addition of colouring materials. The secret of glass\nmaking was taken across Europe by the Romans during this century. However, they\nguarded the skills and technology required to make glass very closely, and it was not until\ntheir empire collapsed in 476 AD that glass-making knowledge became widespread\nthroughout Europe and the Middle East. From the 10th century onwards, the Venetians\ngained a reputation for technical skill and artistic ability in the making of glass bottles, and\nmany of the city’s craftsmen left Italy to set up glassworks throughout Europe.\nA major milestone in the history of glass occurred with the invention of lead crystal glass by\nthe English glass manufacturer George Ravenscroft (1632 - 1683). He attempted to\ncounter the effect of clouding that sometimes occurred in blown glass by introducing lead to\nthe raw materials used in the process. The new glass he created was softer and easier to\ndecorate, and had a higher refractive index, adding to its brilliance and beauty, and it\nproved invaluable to the optical industry. It is thanks to Ravenscroft’s invention that optical\nlenses, astronomical telescopes, microscopes and the like became possible.\nIn Britain, the modem glass industry only really started to develop after the repeal of the\nExcise Act in 1845. Before that time, heavy taxes had been placed on the amount of glass\nmelted in a glasshouse, and were levied continuously from 1745 to 1845. Joseph Paxton’s\nCrystal Palace at London’s Great Exhibition of 1851 marked the beginning of glass as a\nmaterial used in the building industry. This revolutionary new building encouraged the use\nof glass in public, domestic and horticultural architecture. Glass manufacturing techniques\nalso improved with the advancement of science and the development of better technology.\nFrom 1887 onwards, glass making developed from traditional mouth-blowing to a semi-\nautomatic process, after factory- owner HM Ashley introduced a machine capable of\nproducing 200 bottles per hour in Castleford, Yorkshire, England - more than three times\nquicker than any previous production method. Then in 1907, the first fully automated\nmachine was developed in the USA by Michael Owens - founder of the Owens Bottle\nMachine Company (later the major manufacturers Owens- Illinois) - and installed in its\nfactory. Owens’ invention could produce an impressive 2,500 bottles per hour Other\ndevelopments followed rapidly, but it | was not until the First World War when Britain\nbecame cut off from essential glass suppliers, that glass became part of the scientific\nsector. Previous to this, glass had been seen as a craft rather than a precise science.\nToday, glass making is big business. It has become a modem, hi-tech industry operating in\na fiercely competitive global market where quality, design and service levels are critical to\n \n1\n\nmaintaining market share. Modem glass plants are capable of making millions of glass\ncontainers a day in many different colours, with green, brown and clear remaining the most\npopular. Few of us can imagine modem life without glass. It features in almost every aspect\nof our lives - in our homes, our cars and whenever we sit down to eat or drink. Glass\npackaging is used for many products, many beverages are sold in glass, as are numerous\nfoodstuffs, as well as medicines and cosmetics.\nGlass is an ideal material for recycling, and with growing consumer concern for green\nissues, glass bottles and jars are becoming ever more popular. Glass recycling is good\nnews for the environment. It saves used glass containers being sent to landfill. As less\nenergy is needed to melt recycled glass than to melt down raw materials, this also saves\nfuel and production costs. Recycling also reduces the need for raw materials to be\nquarried, thus saving precious resources.\n \n2",
