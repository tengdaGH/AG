The medical world appears to be divided on the effects of the sun upon the human body.\nFrom statements like, “There is no known relationship between a tan and health” to\n“perhaps sun-tanned skin absorbs the ultraviolet rays and converts them into helpful\nenergy”, there are some things which are still the topic of research. Doctors agree on one\nof the benefits of the sun – vitamin D.\nIt is well known that vitamin D is acquired from the direct rays of the sun – an entirely\nseparate miracle from sun tanning. The sun’s ultraviolet rays penetrate only a tiny amount\ninto the human skin, but in the process, they irradiate an element in the skin called\nergosterol, which is a substance that stores up reserves of vitamin D received from the sun.\nThis is both healthy and beneficial for human skin.\nB. All around the Western World, people have developed an obsession with the sun. In\nmany western countries, a suntan has become the trade-mark of a healthy, active, outdoor\nperson. The basic reddish hue just beneath the surface of our skin is the outward reflection\nof the millions of red corpuscles flowing through tiny blood vessels. This is most noticeable\nin the pure skin of a baby which can change in a moment from porcelain white (with anger\nor a switch in temperature) to crimson. In Caucasians, this colouring is somewhat hidden\nby an acquired layer of sun-made pigment, which varies in tone according to the\ncomplexion and occupation of the individual.\nC. Locale plays a big part in the effectiveness of the suntan. Mountain tops and beaches\nare nonpareil sun spas because they receive far purer sunlight than the rest of the land.\nUrban areas with their smoke and smog act as a filter removing all the healthy properties of\nthe sun. Perhaps the seashore is best of all, with its air estimated to have at least a fifth of\na per cent more oxygen than inland ether – free of city and inland dust, tars, pollen, and\nallergens.\nD. The sun has long been called nature’s greatest health giver and healer and has played a\nchief role at health resorts ever since August Rollier, the Swiss father of heliotherapy,\nopened his first high-Alps sanatorium in 1903. Dr. W. W. Coblenz suggests that the sun\ncure is a major factor in the treatment of at least 23 skin diseases, ranging from acne and\neczema to ulcers and wounds. Another specialist, Dr. Richard Kovacs writes, “Sun\ntreatment is often helpful to persons suffering from general debility – repeated colds,\nrespiratory diseases, influenza and the like”.\n \nAfter a long winter, the return to the sun writes Dr. Leonard Dodds, the British sunlight\nscholar, “is a general stimulus to the body, more potent if applied after a period when it has\nbeen lacking which gradually loses its effect if exposure is over prolonged, even when not\nexcessive”.\nE. Over many years of study, dermatologists have proven that excessive exposure to\nsunlight for years is responsible for a large proportion of skin cancer amongst the\npopulation. Those with the greatest chance of doing permanent damage to their skin are\nthe year-round outdoor workers – 90% of which occurs on the heavily exposed hands and\nface. The first line of defense against permanent sun damage is the skin’s own natural fatty\nmatter and sweat, which combine to form an oily acid surface shield against the ultraviolet\n \n1\n\nrays.\nAt the beach, the saltwater washes away this natural oily coat, the hot sun overworks the\nsweat glands so that the excess becomes ineffective and the dry wind and hot sun\ncombine to dehydrate the skin itself. Over the years, women have shown far greater\nwisdom in the care of their skin than men. Since the ladies of ancient Egypt first began to\napply the fat of the so-called sacred temple cats to their faces, women have been tireless in\nwaging this battle against damage to the skin from the sun. Both sexes now contribute\nannually to a multi-million dollar global sunscreen business.\nF. Other pans of the human body which tend to suffer from exposure to the sun are the\neyes and hair. Many years ago, optometrists undertook studies in America to examine the\ninfluence of the sun upon the eyes by studying Atlantic City lifeguards and found that even\na few hours in the bright sun without sunglasses could cause a significant loss of vision – a\nloss that might take several weeks from which to recover.\nSo gradual was the change that the lifeguards were unaware that their sight had been\naffected. The solution to this problem was to introduce sunglasses as a standard part of the\nlifeguard uniform. These were dark enough to absorb the sun’s harmful UV rays and most\nof its infrared and ultraviolet rays.\nG. Of a lesser impact is the effect of the sun upon the hair. The penalty of the sun parching\nis a brittle dryness. Haircare professionals recommend a nutritional cream treatment with a\nsubstance containing lanolin to bring your hair back its natural softness, these usually\ncome in the form of leave-in conditioners, and should be applied frequently, just as you\nwould a sunscreen for the skin. Or, easier still, wear a hat. Wearing a hat has a dual effect:\nit protects the hair and helps to prevent the most dangerous of outdoor afflictions:\nsunstroke.\n \n2",
