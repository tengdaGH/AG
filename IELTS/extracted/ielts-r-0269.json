  "passage_text": "Reading Practice\n \nMaking a change How easy is it for us to change our\nlives - and why?\nIn 1990, a young American named Christopher McCandless gave up his career plans, left\nbehind everyone he knew, including his family, and went off on an adventure. He was 22 at\nthe time. In an act of kindness, he donated all his savings to the famous charity, Oxfam\nInternational, and hitchhiked his way through America to Alaska. His decisions were so\nunusual for his age that Jon Krakauer wrote a book about them called Into the Wild, and\nSean Penn directed a film that had the same title.\nOf course, this is an unusual story. Most college graduates would not do quite the same\nthing. However, studies do show that in teenage years, people are more likely to try out\nnew experiences. Instead of following the family career path, for example, and working his\nway up the same organisation like his grandfather did, a 15-year-old may dream about\nbecoming a traveller - only to find in his early 20s that this fascination with new places is\ndeclining and change is less attractive. This age-related trend can be observed in all\ncultures.\nThe reason why people all over the world become less keen to change as they get older\nmay be because people’s lives generally follow similar patterns and involve similar\ndemands. Most people, wherever they are, aim to find a job and a partner. As they get\nolder, they may have young children to look after and possibly elderly family members.\nThese responsibilities cannot be achieved without some degree of consistency, which\nmeans that new experiences and ideas may not have a place in the person’s life. New\nexperiences may bring excitement but also insecurity, and so most people prefer to stay\nwith the familiar.\nHowever, not every individual is the same. One toddler may want to play a different game\nevery day and get fed up if nothing changes at the nursery. Another may seek out and play\nwith the same children and toys on every visit. Young children who avoid new experiences\nwill grow up to be more conventional than others. Psychologists argue that those who have\nmore open personalities as children are more open than others might be when they are\nolder. They also suggest that young men have a greater interest in novelty than women,\nalthough, as they age, this desire for new experiences fades more quickly than it does in\nwomen.\nThe truth is that, as we get older, we prefer the things we know. We tend to order the same\nmeals in restaurants, sit on the same side of the train when we commute to work, go on\nholiday to the same places and construct our day in the same way. If you are older than 20,\nremember that your openness to new experiences is slowly declining.\nSo you are better off making a new start today than postponing it until later.\n \n1",
