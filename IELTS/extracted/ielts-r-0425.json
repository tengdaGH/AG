  "passage_text": "Reading Practice\n \nTelepathy\nCan human beings communicate by thought alone? For more than a century the issue of\ntelepathy has divided the scientific community, and even today it still sparks bitter\ncontroversy among top academics \nSince the 1970s, parapsychologists at leading universities and research institutes around\nthe world have risked the derision of sceptical colleagues by putting the various claims for\ntelepathy to the test in dozens of rigorous scientific studies. The results and\ntheir implications are dividing even the researchers who uncovered them.\nSome researchers say the results constitute compelling evidence that telepathy is genuine.\nOther parapsychologists believe the field is on the brink of collapse, having tried to produce\ndefinitive scientific proof and failed. Sceptics and advocates alike do concur on one issue,\nhowever: that the most impressive evidence so far has come from the so-called 'ganzfeld'\nexperiments, a German term that means 'whole field'. Reports of telepathic experiences\nhad by people during meditation led parapsychologists to suspect that telepathy might\ninvolve 'signals' passing between people that were so faint that they were usually swamped\nby normal brain activity. In this case, such signals might be more easily detected by those\nexperiencing meditation-like tranquillity in a relaxing 'whole field' of light, sound and\nwarmth.\nThe ganzfeld experiment tries to recreate these conditions with participants sitting in soft\nreclining chairs in a sealed room, listening to relaxing sounds while their eyes are covered\nwith special filters letting in only soft pink light. In early ganzfeld experiments, the telepathy\ntest involved identification of a picture chosen from a random selection of four taken from a\nlarge image bank. The idea was that a person acting as a 'sender' would attempt to beam\nthe image over to the 'receiver' relaxing in the sealed room.\nOnce the session was over, this person was asked to identify which of the four images had\nbeen used. Random guessing would give a hit-rate of 25 per cent; if telepathy is\nreal, however, the hit-rate would be higher. In 1982, the results from the first ganzfeld\nstudies were analysed by one of its pioneers, the American parapsychologist Charles\nHonorton. They pointed to typical hit-rates of better than 30 per cent - a small effect, but\none which statistical tests suggested could not be put down to chance.\nThe implication was that the ganzfeld method had revealed real evidence for telepathy. But\nthere was a crucial flaw in this argument - one routinely overlooked in more conventional\nareas of science. Just because chance had been ruled out as an explanation did not prove\ntelepathy must exist; there were many other ways of getting positive results. These ranged\nfrom 'sensory leakage' - where clues about the pictures accidentally reach the receiver - to\noutright fraud. In response, the researchers issued a review of all the ganzfeld studies done\nup to 1985 to show that 80 per cent had found statistically significant evidence. However,\nthey also agreed that there were still too many problems in the experiments which could\nlead to positive results, and they drew up a list demanding new standards for future\nresearch.\nAfter this, many researchers switched to autoganzfeld tests - an automated variant of the\ntechnique which used computers to perform many of the key tasks such as the\nrandom selection of images. By minimising human involvement, the idea was to minimise\n \n1\n\nthe risk of flawed results. In 1987, results from hundreds of autoganzfeld tests were studied\nby Honorton in a 'meta-analysis', a statistical technique for finding the overall results from\na set of studies. Though less compelling than before, the outcome was still impressive.\nYet some parapsychologists remain disturbed by the lack of consistency between individual\nganzfeld studies. Defenders of telepathy point out that demanding impressive evidence\nfrom every study ignores one basic statistical fact: it takes large samples to detect small\neffects. If, as current results suggest, telepathy produces hit-rates only marginally above\nthe 25 per cent expected by chance, it's unlikely to be detected by a typical ganzfeld study\ninvolving around 40 people: the group is just not big enough. Only when many studies are\ncombined in a meta-analysis will the faint signal of telepathy really become apparent. And\nthat is what researchers do seem to be finding.\nWhat they are certainly not finding, however, is any change in attitude of mainstream\nscientists: most still totally reject the very idea of telepathy. The problem stems at least\nin part from the lack of any plausible mechanism for telepathy.\nVarious theories have been put forward, many focusing on esoteric ideas from theoretical\nphysics. They include 'quantum entanglement', in which events affecting one group of\natoms instantly affect another group, no matter how far apart they may be. While physicists\nhave demonstrated entanglement with specially prepared atoms, no-one knows if it also\nexists between atoms making up human minds. Answering such questions would transform\nparapsychology. This has prompted some researchers to argue that the future lies not in\ncollecting more evidence for telepathy, but in probing possible mechanisms. Some work\nhas begun already, with researchers trying to identify people who are particularly\nsuccessful in autoganzfeld trials. Early results show that creative and artistic people do\nmuch better than average: in one study at the University of Edinburgh, musicians achieved\na hit-rate of 56 per cent. Perhaps more tests like these will eventually give the researchers\nthe evidence they are seeking and strengthen the case for the existence of telepathy.\n \n2",
