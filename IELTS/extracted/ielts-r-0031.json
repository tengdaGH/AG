  "passage_text": "Reading Practice\n \nAntarctic Research\nA\nA little over a century ago, men of the ilk of Scott, Shackleton and Mawson battled against\nAntarctica’s blizzards, cold and deprivation. In the name of Empire and in an age of heroic\ndeeds they created an image of Antarctica that was to last well into the 20th century – an\nimage of remoteness, hardship, bleakness and isolation that was the province of only the\nmost courageous of men. The image was one of a place removed from everyday reality, of\na place with no apparent value to anyone.\nB\nAs we enter the 21st century, our perception of Antarctica has changed. Although\nphysically Antarctica is no closer and probably no warmer, and to spend time there still\ndemands a dedication not seen in ordinary life, the continent and its surrounding ocean are\nincreasingly seen to an integral part of Planet Earth, and a key component in the Earth\nSystem. Is this because the world seems a little smaller these days, shrunk by TV and\ntourism, or is it because Antarctica really does occupy a central spot on Earth’s mantle?\nScientific research during the past half-century has revealed – and continues to reveal –\nthat Antarctica’s great mass and low temperature exert a major influence on climate and\nocean circulation, factors which influence the lives of millions of people all over the globe.\nC\nAntarctica was not always cold. The slow break-up of the super-continent Gondwana with\nthe northward movements of Africa, South America, India and Australia eventually created\nenough space around Antarctica for the development of an Antarctic Circumpolar Current\n(ACC), that flowed from west to east under the influence of the prevailing westerly winds.\nAntarctica cooled, its vegetation perished, glaciation began and the continent took on its\npresent-day appearance. Today the ice that overlies the bedrock is up to 4km thick, and\nsurface temperatures as low as – 89.2deg C have been recorded. The icy blast that howls\nover the ice cap and out to sea – the so-called katabatic wind – can reach 300 km/hr,\ncreating fearsome wind-chill effects.\n \nD\nOut of this extreme environment come some powerful forces that reverberate around the\nworld. The Earth’s rotation, coupled to the generation of cells of low pressure off the\nAntarctic coast, would allow Astronauts a view of Antarctica that is as beautiful as it is\nawesome. Spinning away to the northeast, the cells grow and deepen, whipping up the\nSouthern Ocean into the mountainous seas so respected by mariners. Recent work is\nshowing that the temperature of the ocean may be a better predictor of rainfall in Australia\nthan is the pressure difference between Darwin and Tahiti – the Southern Oscillation Index.\nBy receiving more accurate predictions, graziers in northern Queensland are able to avoid\noverstocking in years when rainfall will be poor. Not only does this limit their losses but it\nprevents serious pasture degradation that may take decades to repair. CSIRO is\ndeveloping this as a prototype forecasting system, but we can confidently predict that as\nwe know more about the Antarctic and the Southern Ocean we will be able to enhance and\nextend our predictive ability.\nE\n \n1\n\nThe ocean’s surface temperature results from the interplay between deep-water\ntemperature, air temperature and ice. Each winter between 4 and 19 million square km of\nsea ice form, locking up huge quantities of heat close to the continent. Only now can we\nstart to unravel the influence of sea ice on the weather that is experienced in southern\nAustralia. But in another way, the extent of sea ice extends its influence far beyond\nAntarctica. Antarctic krill – the small shrimp-like crustaceans that are the staple diet for\nbaleen whales, penguins, some seals, flighted sea birds and many fish – breed well in\nyears when sea ice is extensive and poorly when it is not. Many species of baleen whales\nand flighted sea birds migrate between the hemispheres and when the krill are less\nabundant they do not thrive.\nF\nThe circulatory system of the world’s oceans is like a huge conveyor belt, moving water\nand dissolved minerals and nutrients from one hemisphere to the other, and from the\nocean’s abyssal depths to the surface. The ACC is the longest current in the world and has\nthe largest flow. Through it, the deep flows of the Atlantic, Indian and Pacific Oceans are\njoined to form part of single global thermohaline circulation. During winter, the howling\nkatabatics sometimes scour the ice off patches of the sea’s surface leaving large ice-locked\nlagoons, or ‘polynyas’. Recent research has shown that as fresh sea ice forms, it is\ncontinuously stripped away by the wind and maybe blown up to 90km in a single day. Since\nonly freshwater freezes into ice, the water that remains becomes increasingly salty and\ndense, sinking until it spills over the continental shelf. Coldwater carries more oxygen than\nwarm water, so when it rises, well into the northern hemisphere, it reoxygenates and\nrevitalises the ocean. The state of the northern oceans and their biological productivity owe\nmuch to what happens in the Antarctic.\n \n2",
