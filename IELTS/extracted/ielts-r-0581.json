  "passage_text": "Reading Practice\n \nTickling and Laughter\nA\nThe fingers of an outstretched aim are nearing your body; you bend away folding your\ntorso, bending your head to your shoulder in hopes that you don’t get tickled; but the\ninevitable occurs: yon arc tickled and in hysterics, you chuckle, titter, and burst into\nuncontrollable laughter. Why do we laugh when we are tickled?\nB\n \nTickling is caused by a light sensation across our skin. At times the light sensation can\ncause itching; however, most of the time it causes giggling. If a feather is gently moved\nacross the surface of the skin, it can also cause tickling and giggling. Heavy laughter is\ncaused by someone or something placing repeated pressure on a person and tickling a\nparticular area. The spots tickled often are feet, toes, sides, underarms, and neck which\ncause a great deal of laughter. Yngve Zotterman from Karolinska Institute has found that\ntickling sensations involve signals from nerve fibers. These nerve fibers are associated with\npain and touch. Also, Zotterman has discovered tickling sensations to be associated not\nonly with nerve fibers but also with sense of touch because people who have lost pain\nsensations still laugh when tickled. But really, why do we laugh? Why are we not able to\ntickle ourselves? What part of the brain is responsible for laughter and humor? Why do we\nsay some people have no sense of humor?\nC\nResearch has shown that laughter is more than just a person’s voice and movement and\nthat it requires the coordination of many muscles throughout the body. Laughter also\nincreases blood pressure and heart rate, changes breathing, reduces levels of certain\nneurochemicals (catecholamines, hormones) and provides a boost to dying immune\nsystem. Can laughter improve health? It may be a good way for people to relax because\nmuscle tension is reduced after laughing. Human tests have found some evidence that\nhumorous videos and tapes can reduce feelings of pain, prevent negative stress reactions\nand boost the brain’s biological battle against infection.\nD\nResearchers believe we process humor and laughter through a complex pathway of brain\nactivity that encompasses three main brain components. In one new study, researchers\nused imaging equipment to photograph die brain activity of healthy volunteers while they\nunderwent a sidesplitting assignment of reading written jokes, viewing cartoons from The\nNew Yorker magazine as well as “The Far Side” and listening to digital recordings of\nlaughter. Preliminary results indicate that the humor-processing pathway includes parts of\nthe frontal lobe brain area, important for cognitive processing the supplementary motor\narea, important for movement; and the nucleus accumbens, associated with pleasure.\nInvestigations support the notion that parts of the frontal lobe are involved in humor.\nSubjects’ brains were imaged while they were listening to jokes. An area of the frontal lobe\nwas activated only when they thought a joke was funny. In a study that compared healthy\nindividuals with people who had damage to their frontal lobes, the subjects with damaged\nfrontal lobes were more likely to choose wrong punch lines to written jokes and didn’t laugh\n \n1\n\nor smile as much at funny cartoons or jokes.\nE\nEven though we may know more about what parts of the brain are responsible for humor, it\nis still hard to explain why we don’t laugh or giggle when we tickle ourselves. Darwin\ntheorized within “The Expressions of the Emotions in Man and Animals” that there was a\nlink between tickling and laughter because of the anticipation of pleasure. Because we\ncannot tickle ourselves and have caused laughter, Darwin speculated surprise from\nanother person touching a sensitive spot must have caused laughter. Some scientists\nbelieve that laughing caused by tickling is a built-in reflex even babies have. If we tickle\nourselves in the same spot as our friend tickled us, we do not laugh as we did previously.\nThe information sent to our spinal cord and brain should be exactly the same. Apparently,\nfor tickling to work, the brain needs tension and surprise. When we tickle ourselves, we\nknow exactly what will happen…there is no tension or surprise. How the brain uses this\ninformation about tension and surprise is still a mystery, but there is some evidence that\nthe cerebellum may be involved. Because one part of the brain tells another: “It’s just you.\nDon’t get excited”. Investigations suggest that during self-tickling, the cerebellum tells an\narea called the somatosensory cortex what sensation to expect, and that dampens the\ntickling sensation. It looks as if the killjoy is found in the cerebellum. Further explorations to\nunderstand tickling and laughter were conducted by Christenfeld and Harris. Within ‘The\nMystery of Ticklish Laughter and “Can a Machine Tickleyn they explained that people\nlaughed equally whether tickled by a machine or by a person. The participants were not\naware that who or what was tickling them. However, the laughter was equally resounded. It\nis suggested that tickling response is a reflex, which, like Darwin suggested earlier, is\ndependent on the element of surprise.\nF\nDamage to any one part of the brain may affect one’s overall ability to process humor.\nPeter Derks, a professor of psychology, conducted his research with a group of scientists\nat NASA-Langley in Hampton. Using a sophisticated electroencephalogram (EEG), they\nmeasured the brain activity of 10 people exposed to humorous stimuli. How quickly our\nbrain recognizes the incongruity that deals with most humor and attaches an abstract\nmeaning to it determines whether we laugh. However, different people find different jokes\nfunny. That can be due to a number of factors, including differences in personality,\nintelligence, mental state and probably mood. But according to Derks, the majority of\npeople recognize when a situation is meant to be humorous. In a series of experiments, he\nnoticed that several patients recovering from brain injuries could not distinguish between\nsomething funny and something not.\nG\nDr Shibata of the University of Rochester School of Medicine said our neurons get tickled\nwhen we hear a joke. The brain’s ‘Tunny bone” is located at the right frontal lobe just above\nthe right eye and appears critical to our ability to recognize a joke. Dr Shibata gave his\npatients MRI scans to measure brain activity, trying to find out what part of the brain is\nparticularly active while telling the punch line of a joke as opposed to the rest of the joke\nand funny cartoons in comparison to parts of the cartoons that are not funny. The jokes\n“tickled” the frontal lobes. The scans also showed activity in the nucleus accumbens, which\nis likely related to our feeling of mirth after hearing a good joke and our “addiction” to\n \n2\n\nhumor. While his research was about humor, the results could help lead to answers and\nsolutions to depression. Parts of the brain that are active during humor are actually\nabnormal in patients with depression. Eventually, brain scans might be used to assess\npatients with depression and other mood disorders. The research may also explain why\nsome stroke victims lose their sense of humor or suffer from other personality changes.\nThe same part of the brain is also associated with social and emotional judgment and\nplanning.\n \n3",
