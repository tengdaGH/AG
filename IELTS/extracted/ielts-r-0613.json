  "passage_text": "Reading Practice\nWater Treatment 2: Reed Bed\nIn recent years, it has been shown that plants, more accurately roots, play a crucial part in\npurifying dirty water before it enters seas and rivers. In 15th-century Britain, dirty water was\npurified by passing through the wetlands. People began to realize that the “natural” way of\nwater purification was effective. Nowadays subsurface flow wetlands (SSFW) are a\ncommon alternative in Europe for the treatment of wastewater in rural areas, Mainly in the\nlast 10 to 12 years there has been a significant growth in the number and size of the\nsystems in use. The conventional mechanism of water\npurification used in big cities where there are large volumes of water to be purified is\ninappropriate in rural areas.\n \nThe common reed has the ability to transfer oxygen from its leaves, down through its stem\nand rhizomes, and out via its root system. As a result of this action, a very high population\nof microorganisms occurs in the root system, in zones of aerobic, anoxic, and anaerobic\nconditions. As the waste water moves very slowly through the mass of reed roots, this\nliquid can be successfully treated. The reason why they are so effective is often because\nwithin the bed’s root sector, natural biological, physical and chemical processes interact\nwith one another to degrade or remove a good range of pollutants.\nDirty water from households, farms and factories consume a lot of oxygen in the water,\nwhich will lead to the death of aquatic creatures. Several aquatic plants are important in\npurifying water. They not only absorb carbon dioxide and release oxygen into the water,\nimproving the environment for fish, but absorb nutrients from the welter as well. Britain and\nthe G.S. differ in their preference of plants to purify water. Bulrushes (Scirpus spp.) and\nrushes (Juncus spp.) are excellent water purifiers. They remove excess nutrients from the\nwater as well as oil and bacteria such as Escherichia coli and Salmonella. However, algae\ngrow freely in summer and die off in winter. Their remains foul the bottom of the pool.\nArtificial reed beds purify water in both horizontal and downflow ways. The reeds succeed\nbest when a dense layer of root hairs has formed. It takes three years for the roots to fully\ndevelop. Which type of wetland a certain country applies varies widely depending on the\ncountry in Europe and its main lines of development. Besides the development of\nhorizontal or vertical flow wetlands for wastewater treatment, the use of wetlands for sludge\ntreatment has been very successful in Europe. Some special design lines offer the\nretention of microbiological organisms in constructed wetlands, the treatment of agricultural\nwastewater, treatment of some kinds of industrial wastewater, and the control of diffuse\npollution.\nIf the water is slightly polluted, a horizontal system is used. Horizontal-flow wetlands may\nbe of two types: free-water surface-flow (FWF) or sub-surface water-flow (SSF). In the\nformer the effluent flows freely above the sand/gravel bed in which the reeds etc. are\nplanted; in the latter effluent passes through the sand/gravel bed. In FWF-type wetlands,\neffluent is treated by plant stems, leaves and rhizomes. Such FWF wetlands are densely\n \n1\n\n \n \nplanted and typically have water-depths of less than 0.4m. However, dense planting can\nlimit the diffusion of oxygen into the water.\nThese systems work particularly well for low strength effluents or effluents that have\nundergone some forms of pretreatment and play an invaluable role in tertiary treatment and\nthe polishing of effluents. The horizontal reed flow system uses a long reed bed, where the\nliquid slowly flows horizontally through. The length of the reed bed is about 100 meters.\nThe downside of horizontal reed beds is that they use up lots of land space and they do\ntake quite a long time to produce clean water.\n \nA vertical flow (downflow) reed bed is a sealed, gravel filled trench with reeds growing in it.\nThe reeds in a downflow system are planted in a bed 60cm deep. In vertical flow reed\nbeds, the wastewater is applied to the top of the reed bed, flows down through a rhizome\nzone with sludge as a substrate, then through a root zone with sand as a substrate,\nfollowed by a layer of gravel for drainage, and is collected in an under drainage system of\nlarge stones.\nThe effluent flows onto the surface of the bed and percolates slowly through the different\nlayers into an outlet pipe, which leads to a horizontal flow bed where it is cleaned by\nmillions of bacteria, algae, fungi, and microorganisms that digest the waste, including\nsewage. There is no standing water so there should be no unpleasant smells.\nVertical flow reed bed systems are much more effective than horizontal flow reedbeds not\nonly in reducing biochemical oxygen demanded (BOD) and suspended solids (SS) levels\nbut also in reducing ammonia levels and eliminating smells. Usually considerably smaller\nthan horizontal flow beds, they are capable of handling muc stronger effluents which\ncontain heavily polluted matters and have a longer lifetime value. A vertical reed bed\nsystem works more efficiently than a horizontal reed bed system, but it requires more\nmanagement, and its reed beds are often operated for a few days then rested, so several\nbeds and a distribution system are needed.\nThe natural way of water purification has many advantages over the conventional\nmechanism. The natural way requires less expenditure for installation, operation and\nmaintenance. Besides, it looks attractive and can improve the surrounding landscape.\nReed beds are natural habitats found in floodplains, waterlogged depressions and\nestuaries. The natural bed systems are a biologically proved, an environmentally friendly\nand visually unobtrusive way of treating wastewater, and have the extra virtue of frequently\nbeing better than mechanical wastewater treatment systems.\nOver the medium to long term reed bed systems are, in most cases, more cost effective to\ninstall than any other wastewater treatment.
