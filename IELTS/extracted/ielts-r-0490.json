  "passage_text": "Reading Practice\n \nThe history of jeans\nThe first people to wear jeans were sailors in the 16th century. Sailors were gone for a long\ntime. They had to do hard work outside in bad weather. Often their clothes had holes in\nthem, got thinner or lost color. They needed something strong against wear and tear. Their\nclothes had to last longer and stay in good condition. They found this type of cloth during\ntheir trip to India. It was made of thick cotton and was called dungaree. It was dyed indigo.\nIndians use the indigo plant to color this type of cloth in factories. Sailors bought dungaree\ncloth in outside markets, cut it and wore it on their trips home.\nThe first jeans were made in Genoa. Genoa is a city in Italy. In the 16th century, Genoa\nwas very powerful. Its sailors traveled all around the world. The Genoa city decided to\nmake better pants for their sailors. They used the dungaree cloth because it was sturdy\nand strong. The new pants were called 'geanos' or 'jeanos'. Sailors could use it in both wet\nand dry weather. They could roll up the pants when cleaning the ship. To clean the pants,\nthey put them inside a net, threw it in the ocean and dragged the net behind the ship. This\nis when they realized their color changes to white. This is how bleached jeans were\ninvented.\nLater French workers in Nimes also made jeans. They used a different type of cloth called\ndenim. But it was also sturdy and dyed blue, like the jeanos. In 1872, there was a small\ncloth merchant in Germany. His name was Levi Strauss. He bought and sold denim from\nFrance but Levi Strauss got into trouble and had to go away to America. In New York Levi\nlearned how to sew. When he moved to San Francisco, he met many gold diggers. These\nmen went to find gold in rivers. The weather was often bad and the men were only thin\npants. Levi started to cut pants out of denim. He sold these jeans to the gold diggers, and\nthey loved them. Soon all factory workers and farmers were wearing jeans too. They were\ncomfortable and easy to take care of and cheap.\nIn 1950, popular movie and music stars like Elvis Presley and James Dean started wearing\njeans. Those jeans were really tight and parents didn't like them. But they caught on with\nteenagers. Jeans became so popular because they meant freedom. Teenagers wanted to\nbe independent and to make their own rules. In 1960 they started to decorate their jeans\nwith flowers and colorful designs, or to tear and rip the jeans.\nBut in 1980 jeans became very expensive. Famous fashion designers like Calvin Klein\nbegan making designer jeans. They put their name on these jeans. Young people wanted\nto wear certain brands to show their style. There was a lot of pressure to keep up with the\ntrend. Everybody wanted to be fashionable. Jeans were considered the uniform of youth.\nYou had to wear jeans to be in style.\n \n1",
