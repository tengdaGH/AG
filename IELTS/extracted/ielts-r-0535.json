  "passage_text": "Reading Practice\n \nThe Problem of Scarce Resources\nSection A\nThe problem of how health-care resources should be allocated or apportioned, so that they\nare distributed in both, the most just and most efficient way, is not a new one. Every health\nsystem in an economically developed society is faced with the need to decide (either\nformally or informally) what proportion of the community’s total resources should be spent\non health-care; how resources are to be apportioned; what diseases and disabilities and\nwhich forms of treatment are to be given priority; which members of the community are to\nbe given special consideration in respect of their health needs; and which forms of\ntreatment are the most cost-effective.\nSection B\nWhat is new is that, from the 1950s onwards, there have been certain general changes in\noutlook about the finitude of resources as a whole and of health-care resources in\nparticular, as well as more specific changes regarding the clientele of health-care\nresources and the cost to the community of those resources. Thus, in the 1950s and\n1960s, there emerged an awareness in Western societies that resources for the provision\nof fossil fuel energy were finite and exhaustible and that the capacity of nature or the\nenvironment to sustain economic development and population was also finite. In other\nwords, we became aware of the obvious fact that there were ‘limits to growth’. The new\nconsciousness that there were also severe limits to health-care resources was part of this\ngeneral revelation of the obvious. Looking back, it now seems quite incredible that in the\nnational health systems that emerged in many countries in the years immediately after the\n1939-45 World War, it was assumed without question that all the basic health needs of any\ncommunity could be satisfied, at least in principle; the ‘invisible hand’ of economic progress\nwould provide.\nSection C\nHowever, at exactly the same time as this new realisation of the finite character of health-\ncare resources was sinking in, an awareness of a contrary kind was developing in Western\nsocieties: that people have a basic right to health-care as a necessary condition of a proper\nhuman life. Like education, political and legal processes and institutions, public order,\ncommunication, transport and money supply, health-care came to be seen as one of the\nfundamental social facilities necessary for people to exercise their other rights as\nautonomous human beings. People are not in a position to exer- | cise personal liberty and\nto be self-determining if they are poverty-stricken, or deprived of basic education, or do not\nlive within a context of law and order. In the same way, basic health-care is a condition of\nthe exercise of autonomy.\nSection D\nAlthough the language of ‘rights’ sometimes leads to confusion, by the late 1970s it was\nrecognised in most societies that people have a right to health-care (though there has been\nconsiderable resistance in the United States to the idea that there is a formal right to\nhealth-care). It is also accepted that this right generates an obligation or duty for the state\nto ensure that adequate health-care resources are provided out of the public purse. The\n \n1\n\nstate has no obligation to provide a health-care system itself, but to ensure that such a\nsystem is provided. Put another way, basic health-care is now recognised as a ‘public\ngood’, rather than a ‘private good’ that one is expected to buy for oneself. As the 1976\ndeclaration of the World Health Organisation put it: ‘The enjoyment of the highest attainable\nstandard of health is one of the fundamental rights of every human being without distinction\nof race, religion, political belief, economic or social condition.’ As has just been remarked,\nin a liberal society basic health is seen as one of the indispensable conditions for the\nexercise of personal autonomy.\n \n \nSection E\nJust at the time when it became obvious that health-care resources could not possibly meet\nthe demands being made upon them, people were demanding that their fundamental right\nto health-care be satisfied by the state. The second set of more specific changes that have\nled to the present concern about the distribution of health-care resources stems from the\ndramatic rise in health costs in most OECD1 countries, accompanied by large-scale\ndemographic and social changes which have meant, to take one example, that elderly\npeople are now major (and relatively very expensive) consumers of health-care resources.\nThus in OECD countries as a whole, health costs increased from 3.8% of GDP1 2 in 1960\nto 7% of GDP in 1980, and it has been predicted that the proportion of health costs to GDP\nwill continue to increase. (In the US the current figure is about 12% of GDP, and in\nAustralia about 7.8% of GDP)\n \nAs a consequence, during the 1980s a kind of doomsday scenario (analogous to similar\ndoomsday extrapolations about energy needs and fossil fuels or about population\nincreases) was projected by health administrators, economists and politicians, i In this\nscenario, ever-rising health costs were matched against static or declining resources.\n \n1Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development\n2Gross Domestic Product\n \n2",
