  "passage_text": "Reading Practice\n \nInside the mind of a fan: How watching sport affects the\nbrain\nA\nAt about the same time that the poet Homer invented the epic here, the ancient Greeks\nstarted a festival in which men competed in a single race, about 200 metres long. The\nwinner received a branch of wild olives. The Greeks called this celebration the Olympics.\nThrough the ancient sprint remains, today the Olympics are far more than that. Indeed, the\nGames seem to celebrate the dream of progress as embodied in the human form. That the\nGames are intoxicating to watch is beyond question. During the Athens Olympics in 2004,\n3.4 billion people, half the world, watched them on television. Certainly, being a spectator is\na thrilling experience: but why?\nB\nIn 1996, three Italian neuroscientists, Giacomo Rizzolatti, Leonardo Forgassi and Vittorio\nGallese, examined the premotor cortex of monkeys. The discovered that inside these\nprimate brains there were groups of cells that ‘store vocabularies of motor actions’. Just as\nthere are grammars of movement. These networks of cells are the bodily ‘sentences’ we\nuse every day, the ones our brain has chosen to retain and refine. Think, for example,\nabout a golf swing. To those who have only watched the Master’s Tournament on TV,\ngolfing seems easy. To the novice, however, the skill of casting a smooth arc with a lop-\nside metal stick is virtually impossible. This is because most novices swing with their\nconsciousness, using an area of brain next to the premotor cortex. To the expert, on the\nother hand, a perfectly balanced stroke is second nature. For him, the motor action has\nbecome memorized, and the movements are embedded in the neurons of his premotor\ncortex. He hits the ball with the tranquility of his perfected autopilot.\nC\nThese neurons in the premotor cortex, besides explaining why certain athletes seem to\npossess almost unbelievable levels of skill, have an even more amazing characteristic, one\nthat caused Rizzolatti, Fogassi and Gallese to give them the lofty title ‘mirror neurons’.\nThey note, The main functional characteristic of mirror neurons is that they become active\nboth when the monkey performs a particular action (for example, grasping an object or\nholding it) and, astonishingly, when it sees another individual performing a similar action.’\nHumans have an even more elaborate mirror neuron system. These peculiar cells mirror,\ninside the brain, the outside world: they enable us to internalize the actions of another. In\norder to be activated, though, these cells require what the scientists call ‘goal-orientated\nmovements’. If we are staring at a photograph, a fixed image of a runner mid-stride, our\nmirror neurons are totally silent. They only fire when the runner is active: running, moving\nor sprinting.\nD\nWhat these electrophysiological studies indicate is that when we watch a golfer or a runner\nin action, the mirror neurons in our own premotor cortex light up as if we were the ones\ncompeting. This phenomenon of neural mirror was first discovered in 1954, when two\nFrench physiologists, Gastaut and Berf, found that the brains of humans vibrate with two\n \n1\n\ndistinct wavelengths, alpha and mu. The mu system is involved in neural mirroring. It is\nactive when your bodies are still, and disappears whenever we do something active, like\nplaying a sport or changing the TV channel. The surprising fact is that the mu signal is also\nquiet when we watch someone else being active, as on TV, these results are the effect of\nmirror neurons.\nE\nRizzolatti, Fogassi and Gallese call the idea for mirror neurons the ‘direct matching\nhypothesis’. They believe that we only understand the movement of sports stars when we\n‘map the visual representation of the observed action onto our motor representation of the\nsame action’. According to this theory, watching an Olympic athlete ‘causes the motor\nsystem of the observer to resonate. The “motor knowledge” of the observer is used to\nunderstand the observed action.’ But mirror neurons are more than just the neural basis for\nour attitude to sport. It turns out that watching a great golfer makes us better golfers, and\nwatching a great sprinter actually makes us run faster. This ability to learn by watching is a\ncrucial skill. From the acquisition of language as infants to learning facial expressions,\nmimesis (copying) is an essential part of being conscious. The best athletes are those with\na premotor cortex capable of imagining the movements of victory, together with the\nphysical properties to make those movements real.\nF\nBut how many of us regularly watch sports in order to be a better athlete? Rather, we\nwatch sport for the feeling, the human drama. This feeling also derives from mirror\nneurons. By letting spectators share in the motions of victory, they also allow us to share in\nits feelings. This is because they are directly connected to the amygdale, one of the main\nbrain regions involved in emotion. During the Olympics, the mirror neurons of whole nations\nwill be electrically identical, their athletes causing spectators to feel, just for a second or\ntwo, the same thing. Watching sports brings people together. Most of us will never run a\nmile in under four minutes, or hit a home run. Our consolation comes in watching, when we\ngather around the TV, we all feel, just for a moment, what it is to do something perfectly.\n \n2",
