  "passage_text": "Reading Practice\n \n \nThe Sweet Scent of Success\n \nA Innovation and entrepreneurship, in the right mix, can bring spectacular results and\npropel a business ahead of the pack. Across a diverse range of commercial successes,\nfrom the Hills Hoist clothes line to the Cochlear ear implant, it is hardto generalize beyond\nsaying the creators tapped into something consumers could not wait to get their hands on.\nHowever, most ideas never make it to the market. Some ideas that innovators are spruiking\nto potential investors include new water-saving shower heads, a keyless locking system,\nping-pong balls that keep pollution out of rainwater tanks, making teeth grow from\nstemcells inserted in the gum, and technology to stop LPG tanks from exploding. Grant\nKearney, chief executive of the Innovation Xchange, which connects businesses to\ninnovation networks, says he hears of great business ideas that he knows will never get on\nthe market. “Ideas by themselves are absolutely useless,”he says. “An idea only becomes\ninnovation when it is connected to the right resources and capabilities\".\n \nB One of Australia’s latest innovation successes stems from a lemon-scented bath-room\ncleaner called Shower Power, the formula for which was concocted in afactory in Yatala,\nQueensland. In 1995, Tom Quinn and John Heron bought a struggling cleaning products\nbusiness, OzKleen, for 250,000. It was selling 100 different kinds of cleaning products,\nmainly in bulk. The business was in bad shape, the cleaning formulas were ineffective and\nenvironmentally harsh, and there were few regular clients. Now Shower Power is claimed\nto be the top-selling bathroom cleaning product in the country. In the past 12 months\n,almost four million bottles of OzKleen’s Power products have been sold and the company\nforecasts 2004 sales of 10 million bottles. The company’s, sales in2003 reached $11\nmillion, with 700k of business being exports. In particular, Shower Power is making big\ninroads on the British market.\n \nC OzKleen’s turnaround began when Quinn and Heron hired an industrial chemist to\nrevitalize the product line. Market research showed that people werelooking for a better\ncleaner for the bathroom, universally regarded as the hardest room in the home to clean.\nThe company also wanted to make the product formulas more environmentally friendly One\nof Tom Quinn’s sons, Peter, aged 24 at the time, began working with the chemist on the\nformulas, looking at the potential for citrus-based cleaning products. He detested all the\nchlorine-based cleaning products that dominated the market. “We didn’t want to use\nchlorine, simple as that,”he says. “It offers bad working conditions and there’s no money in\nit.”Peter looked at citrus ingredients, such as orange peel, to replace the petroleum by-\nproducts in cleaners. He is credited with finding the Shower Power formula. “The head,”he\nsays. The company is the recipe is in a vault somewhere and in my sole owner of the\nintellectual property.\nD To begin with, Shower Power was sold only in commercial quantities but Tom Quinn\ndecided to sell it in 750ml bottles after the constant “raves”from customers at their retail\nstore at Beenleigh, near Brisbane. Customers were travel- ling long distances to buy\nsupplies. Others began writing to OzKleen to say how good Shower Power was. “We did a\ndummy label and went to see Woolworths,”Tom Quinn says. The Woolworths buyer took a\nbottle home and was able to remove a stain from her basin that had been impossible to\n \n1\n\nshift. Fromthat point on, she championed the product and OzKleen had its first super-\nmarket order, for a palette of Shower Power worth $3000. “We were over the moon,”says\nOzKleen’s financial controller, Belinda McDonnell.\n \nE  Shower Power was released in Australian supermarkets in 1997 and becamethe top-\nselling product in its category within six months. It was all hands on deck cat the factory,\nlabeling and bottling Shower Power to keep up with demand. OzKleen ditched all other\nproducts and rebuilt the business around Shower Power. This stage, recalls McDonnell,\nwas very tough. “It washandto-mouth, cashflow was very difficult,”she says. OzKleen had\nto pay new-line fees to supermarket chains, which also squeezed margins.\n \nF OzKleen’s next big break came when the daughter of a Coles Myer executive 1 used the\nproduct while on holidays in Queensland and convinced her father that Shower Power\nshould be in Coles supermarkets. Despite the product success, Peter Quinn says the\ncompany was wary of how long the sales would last and hesitated to spend money on\nupgrading the manufacturing process. As a result, he remembersjtang periods of working\nround the clock to keep up with orders. Small tanks were still being used, so batches were\nsmall and bottles were labelled and filled manually. The privately owned OzKleen relied on\ncash flow to expand. “The equipment could not keep up with demand,” Peter Quinn says.\nEventually a new bottling machine was bought for $50,000 in the hope of streamlining\nproduction, but he says: “We got ripped off.” Since then, he has been developing a new\nautomated bottling machine that can control the amount of foam produced in the liquid, so\nthat bottles can be filled more effectively - “I love coming up with new ideas.” The machine\nis being patented.\nG Peter Quinn says OzKleen’s approach to research and development is open slather. “If I\nneed it, I get it. It is about doing something simple that no one else is doing. Most of these\nthings are just sitting in front of people ... it’s just seeing the opportunities.” With a tried and\ntested product, OzKleen is expanding overseas and developing more Power-brand\nhousehold products. Tom Quinn, who previously ran a real estate agency, says: “We are\ncompeting with the same market all over the world, the cleaning products are sold\neverywhere.” Shower Power, known as Bath Power in Britain, was launched four years ago\nwith the help of an export development grant from the Federal Government. “We wanted to\ndo it straight away because we realised we had the same opportunities worldwide.”\nOzKleen is already number three in the British market, and the next stop is France. The\nPower range includes cleaning products for carpets, kitchens and pre-wash stain removal.\nThe Quinn and Heron families are still involved. OzKleen has been approached with offers\nto buy the company, but Tom Quinn says he is happy with things as they are. “We’re\nhaving too much fun.”\n \n2",
