  "passage_text": "Reading Practice\n \nInternal and External Marketing\nA\nEmployees need to hear the same messages that you send out to the marketplace. At\nmost companies, however, internal and external communications are often mismatched.\nThis can be very confusing, and it threatens employees’ perceptions of the company’s\nintegrity: They are told one thing by management but observe that a different message is\nbeing sent to the public. One health insurance company, for instance, advertised that the\nwelfare of patients was the company’s number one priority, while employees were told that\ntheir main goal was to increase the value of their stock options through cost reductions.\nAnd one major financial services institution told customers that it was making a major shift\nin focus from being a financial retailer to a financial adviser, but, a year later, research\nshowed that the customer experience with the company had not changed. It turned out that\ncompany leaders had not made an effort to sell the change internally, so employees were\nstill churning out transactions and hadn’t changed their behavior to match their new adviser\nrole.\nB\nEnabling employees to deliver on customer expectations is important, of course, but it’s not\nthe only reason a company needs to match internal and external messages. Another\nreason is to help push the company to achieve goals that might otherwise be out of reach.\nIn 1997, when IBM launched its e-business campaign (which is widely credited for turning\naround the company’s image), it chose to ignore research that suggested consumers were\nunprepared to embrace IBM as a leader in e-business. Although to the outside world this\nlooked like an external marketing effort, IBM was also using the campaign to align\nemployees around the idea of the Internet as the future of technology. The internal\ncampaign changed the way employees thought about everything they did, from how they\nnamed products to how they organized staff to how they approached selling. The campaign\nwas successful largely because it gave employees a sense of direction and purpose, which\nin turn restored their confidence in IBM’s ability to predict the future and lead the\ntechnology industry. Today, research shows that people are four times more likely to\nassociate the term “e-business” with IBM than with its nearest competitor, Microsoft.\nC\nThe type of “two-way branding” that IBM did so successfully strengthens both sides of the\nequation. Internal marketing becomes stronger because it can draw on the same “big idea”\nas advertising. Consumer marketing becomes stronger because the messages are\ndeveloped based on employees’ behavior and attitudes, as well as on the company’s\nstrengths and capabilities – indeed, the themes are drawn from the company’s very soul.\nThis process can result in a more distinct advertising idea because marketers are more\nlikely to create a message that’s unique to the company.\nD\nPerhaps even more important, by taking employees into account, a company can avoid\ncreating a message that doesn’t resonate with staff or, worse, one that builds resentment.\nIn 1996, United Airlines shelved its “Come Fly the Friendly Skies” slogan when presented\n \n1\n\nwith a survey that revealed the depth of customer resentment toward the airline industry. In\nan effort to own up to the industry’s shortcomings, United launched a new campaign,\n“Rising,” in which it sought to differentiate itself by acknowledging poor service and\npromising incremental improvements such as better meals. While this was a logical\npremise for the campaign given the tenor of the times, a campaign focusing on customers’\ndistaste for flying was deeply discouraging to the staff. Employee resentment ultimately\nmade it impossible for United to deliver the improvements it was promising, which in turn\nundermined the “Rising” pledge. Three years later, United decided employee opposition\nwas undermining its success and pulled the campaign. It has since moved to a more\ninclusive brand message with the line “United,” which both audiences can embrace. Here,\na fundamental principle of advertising – find and address a customer concern – failed\nUnited because it did not consider the internal market.\nE\nWhen it comes to execution, the most common and effective way to link internal and\nexternal marketing campaigns is to create external advertising that targets both audiences.\nIBM used this tactic very effectively when it launched its e-business campaign. It took out\nan eight-page ad in the Wall Street Journal declaring its new vision, a message directed at\nboth customers and internal stakeholders. This is an expensive way to capture attention,\nbut if used sparingly, it is the most powerful form of communication; in fact, you need do it\nonly once for everyone in the company to read it. There’s a symbolic advantage as well.\nSuch a tactic signals that the company is taking its pledge very seriously; it also signals\ntransparency – the same message going out to both audiences.\nF\nAdvertising isn’t the only way to link internal and external marketing. At Nike, a number of\nsenior executives now hold the additional title of “Corporate Storyteller.” They deliberately\navoid stories of financial successes and concentrate on parables of “just doing it,”\nreflecting and reinforcing the company’s ad campaigns. One tale, for example, recalls how\nlegendary coach and Nike co-founder Bill Bowerman, in an effort to build a better shoe for\nhis team, poured rubber into the family waffle iron, giving birth to the prototype of Nike’s\nfamous Waffle Sole. By talking about such inventive moves, the company hopes to keep\nthe spirit of innovation that characterizes its ad campaigns alive and well within the\ncompany.\nG\nBut while their messages must be aligned, companies must also keep external promises a\nlittle ahead of internal realities. Such promises provide incentives for employees and give\nthem something to live up to. In the 1980s, Ford turned “Quality is Job!” from an internal\nrallying cry into a consumer slogan in response to the threat from cheaper, more reliable\nJapanese cars. It did so before the claim was fully justified, but by placing it in the public\narena, it gave employees an incentive to match the Japanese. If the promise is pushed too\nfar ahead, however, it loses credibility. When a beleaguered British Rail launched a\ncampaign announcing service improvement under the banner “We’re Getting There,” it did\nso prematurely. By drawing attention to the gap between the promise and the reality, it\nprompted destructive press coverage. This, in turn, demoralized staff, who had been\nlegitimately proud of the service advances they had made.\n \n2",
