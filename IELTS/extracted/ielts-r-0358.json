  "passage_text": "Reading Practice\n \n \nReading in a whole new way\n \n \nAs technology improves, how does the act of reading change?\n \n \nReading and writing, like all technologies, are constantly changing. In ancient times,\nauthors often dictated their books. Dictation sounded like an uninterrupted series of words,\nso scribes wrote these down in one long continuous string, justastheyoccurinspeech. For\nthis reason, text was written without spaces between words until the 11th century.\n \nThis continuous script made books hard to read, so only a few people were accomplished\nat reading them aloud to others. Being able to read silently to yourself was considered an\namazing talent; writing was an even rarer skill. In fact, in 15th-century Europe, only one in\n20 adult males could write.\n \nAfter Gutenberg’s invention of the printing press in about 1440, mass-produced books\nchanged the way people read and wrote. The technology of printing increased the number\nof words available, and more types of media, such as newspapers and magazines,\nbroadened what was written about. Authors no longer had to produce scholarly works, as\nwas common until then, but could write, for example, inexpensive, heart-rending love\nstories or publish autobiographies, even if they were unknown.\n \n \nIn time, the power of the written word gave birth to the idea of authority and expertise. Laws\nwere compiled into official documents, contracts were written down and nothing was valid\nunless it was in this form. Painting, music, architecture, dance were all important, but the\nheartbeat of many cultures was the turning pages of a book. By the early 19th century,\npublic libraries had been built in many cities.\n \n \nToday, words are migrating from paper to computers, phones, laptops and game consoles.\nSome 4.5 billion digital screens illuminate our lives. Letters are no longer fixed in black ink\non paper, but flitter on a glass surface in a rainbow of colors as fast as our eyes can blink.\nScreens fill our pockets, briefcases, cars, living-room walls and the sides of buildings. They\nsit in front of us when we work - regardless of what we do. And of course, these newly\nubiquitous screens have changed how we read and write.\nThe first screens that overtook culture, several decades ago - the big, fat, warm tubes of\ntelevision - reduced the time we spent reading to such an extent that it seemed as if\nreading and writing were over. Educators and parents worried deeply that the TV\ngeneration would be unable to write. But the interconnected, cool, thin displays of computer\nscreens launched an epidemic of writing that continues to swell. As a consequence, the\namount of time people spend reading has almost tripled since 1980. By 2008, the World\nWide Web contained more than a trillion pages, and that total grows rapidly every day.\nBut it is not book reading or newspaper reading, it is screen reading. Screens are always\non, and, unlike books, we never stop staring at them. This new platform is very visual, and\nit is gradually merging words with moving images. You might think of this new medium as\nbooks we watch, or television we read. We also use screens to present data, and this\nencourages numeracy: visualising data and reading charts, looking at pictures and symbols\nare all part of this new literacy.\nScreens engage our bodies, too. The most we may do while reading a book is to flip the\npages or turn over a corner, but when we use a screen, we interact with what we see. In\n \n1\n\n \n \nthe futuristic movie Minority Report, the main character stands in front of a screen and\nhunts through huge amounts of information as if conducting an orchestra. Just as it\nseemed strange five centuries ago to see someone read silently, in the future it will seem\nstrange to read without moving your body.\nIn addition, screens encourage more utilitarian (practical) thinking. A new idea or unfamiliar\nfact will cause a reflex to do something: to research a word, to question your screen\n‘friends’ for their opinions or to find alternative views. Book reading strengthened our\nanalytical skills, encouraging us to think carefully about how we feel. Screen reading, on\nthe other hand, encourages quick responses, associating this idea with another, equipping\nus to deal with the thousands of new thoughts expressed every day. For example, we\nreview a movie for our friends while we watch it; we read the owner’s manual of a device\nwe see in a shop before we purchase it, rather than after we get home and discover that it\ncan’t do what we need it to do.\nScreens provoke action instead of persuasion. Propaganda is less effective, and false\ninformation is hard to deliver in a world of screens because while misinformation travels\nfast, corrections do, too. On a screen, it is often easier to correct a falsehood than to tell\none in the first place. Wikipedia works so well because it removes an error in a single click.\nIn books, we find a revealed truth; on the screen, we assemble our own truth from pieces.\nWhat is more, a screen can reveal the inner nature of things. Waving the camera eye of a\nsmartphone over the bar code of a manufactured product reveals its price, origins and even\nrelevant comments by other owners. It is as if the screen displays the object’s intangible\nessence. A popular children’s toy (Webkinz) instills stuffed animals with a virtual character\nthat is ‘hidden’ inside; a screen enables children to play with this inner character online in a\nvirtual world.\nIn the near future, screens will be the first place we’ll look for answers, for friends, for news,\nfor meaning, for our sense of who we are and who we can be.\n \n2",
