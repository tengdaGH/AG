  "passage_text": "Reading Practice\n \n \nAmbergris\n \nA The name ambergris is derived from the Spanish “ambar gris”, ambar meaning amber\nand gris meaning grey, thus the name signifies grey amber. Theuse of ambergris in Europe\nis now entirely confined to perfumery-as a material of perfumery. Its high price varies\nfrom$15 to$25 an ounce, though it formerlyoccupied on inconsiderable place in medicine.\nAmbergris was also decoratedandworn as jewelry, particularly during the RenaissanceIt\noccupies a very important place in the perfumery of the East, and there it is also used in\npharmacy and as a flavouring material in cookery.\n \nB Amber, however, is quite a different substance from ambergris and thisdiscrepancy has\npuzzled some people. Amber is the fossilized resin from trees that was quite familiar to\nEuropeans long before the discovery of the New World, and prized for jewelry. Although\nconsidered a gem, amber is a hard, transparent and wholly-organic material derived from\nthe resin of extinct species of trees. In the dense forests of the Middle Cretaceous and\nTertiary periods, between 10 and 100 million years ago, these resin-bearing trees fell and\nwere carried by rivers to coastal regions. There, the trees and their resins became covered\nwith sediment, and over millions of years the resin hardened into amber.\n \nC Ambergris and amber are related by the fact that both wash up on beaches. Ambergris is\na solid, waxy and flammable substance of a dull 2rey or blackish color, with the shades\nbeing variegated 1ike marble. It possesses a peculiar sweetearthy odour not unlike\nisopropyl alcohol. It is now known to be a morbid secretion formed in the intestines of the\nsperm whale, found in the Atlantic and Pacific oceans. Being a very lightweight material,\nambergris is found floating upon the sea, on the sea coast, or in the sand near the sea\ncoastIt is met with in the Atlantic Ocean, on the coasts Of Brazil and Madagascar; also on\nthe coast Of Africa, of the East Indies, China, Japan, and the Molucca Islands; but most of\nthe ambergris which is brought to England comes from the Bahama Islands. It is also\nsometimes found in the abdomen of whales; it is always in lumps in various shapes and\nsizes, weighing from 1/ 2 oz. to 100 or more lb. A piece which the Dutch East India\nCompany bought from the King of Tydore weighed 182 lb. An American fisherman from\nAntigua found, Inside a whale, about 52 1eagues south-east from the Windward Islands, a\npiece of ambergris which weighed about l 30 lb, and sold for 500 sterling.\n \nD Like many other substances regarding the origin of which there existed some obscurity\nor mystery, ambergris in former times possessed a value, and had properties attributed to\nit, more on account of the source from which it was drawn than from its inherent qualities.\nMany ridiculous hypotheses were started to account for its origin, and among others it was\nconjectured to be the solidified foam of the sea, a fungous growth in the ocean similar to\nthe fungi which form on trees.\nE The true source and character of ambergris was first satisfactorily established by Dr.\nSwediaur in a communication to the Royal Society. It was found by Dr. Swediaur that\nambergris very frequently contained the horny mandibles or beaks of the squid, on which\nthe sperm whales are known to feed. That observation, in connection with the fact of\n \n1\n\n \nambergris being frequently taken from the intestines of the sperm whale, sufficiently proved\nthat the substance is produced by the whale’s intestine as a means of facilitating the\npassage of undigested hard, sharp beaks of squid that the whale has eaten.\n \nF It was further observed that the whales in which ambergris was found were either dead or\nmuch wasted and evidently in a sickly condition. From this it was inferred that ambergris is\nin some way connected with a morbid condition of the sperm whale. Often expelled by\nvomiting, ambergris floats in chunks on the water and is of a deep grey colour, soft\nconsistence, and an offensive, disagreeable smell. Following months to years of photo-\ndegradation andoxidation in the ocean, this precursor gradually hardens, developing a dark\ngrey or black colour, a crusty and waxy texture, and a peculiar odour that is at once sweet,\nearthy, marine, and animalist. Its smell has been described by many as a vastly richer and\nsmoother version of isopropanol without its stinging harshness.\n \nG In that condition its specific gravity ranges from 0.780 to 0.926. It melts at a temperature\nof about 145 F into a fatty yellow resin-like liquidIt is soluble in ether, volatile and fixed oils,\nbut only feebly acted on by acids. By digesting in hot alcohol, a peculiar substance termed\nambrein is obtained. In chemical constitution ambrein very closely resembles cholesterin, a\nprinciple found abundantly in biliary calculi . It is therefore more than probable that\nambergris, from the position in which it is found and its chemical constitution, is a biliary\nconcretion analogous to what is formed in other mammals.\n \nH The industries founded on ambergris resulted in the slaughter of sperm whales  almost to\nextinction. Sperm whales were killed in two massive hunts, the Moby Dick whalers who\nworked mainly between 1740-1 880, and themodem whalers whose operations peaked in 1\n964, when 29,255 were killed. Most recent estimates suggest a global population of about\n360,000 animals down from about 1,100,000 before whaling. In the 20th century, 90% of\nambergris was derived in the processing of killing sperm whales. To this day, ambergris is\nstill the most expensive product in the whole body of sperm whale. Depending on its\nquality, raw ambergris fetches approximately 20 USD per gram. In the United States,\npossession of any part of an endangered species-including ambergris that has washed\nashore-is a violation of the Endangered Species Act of 1978.\nI Historically, the primary commercial use of ambergris has been in fragrancechemistry.\nHowever, it is difficult to get a consistent and reliable supply of high quality ambergris. Due\nto demand for ambergris and its high price, replacement compounds have been sought out\nby the fragrance industry and chemically synthesized. The most important of these is\nAmbrox, which has taken its place as the most widely used amber odorant in perfume\nmanufacture. Procedures for the microbial production of Ambrox have also been devised.\n \n2",
