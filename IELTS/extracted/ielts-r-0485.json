  "passage_text": "Reading Practice\n \nThe History of Bicycles\nThe bicycle was not invented by one individual or in one country. It took nearly 100 years\nand many individuals for the modern bicycle to be born. By the end of those 100 years,\nbicycles had revolutionized the way people travel from place to place.\nBicycles first appeared in Scotland in the early 1800s, and were called velocipedes. These\nearly bicycles had two wheels, but they had no pedals. The rider sat on a pillow and walked\nhis feet along the ground to move his velocipede forward.\nSoon a French inventor added pedals to the front wheel. Instead of walking their vehicles,\nriders used their feet to run the pedals. However, pedaling was hard because velocipedes\nwere very heavy. The framework was made of solid steel tubes and the wooden wheels\nwere covered with steel. Even so, velocipedes were popular among rich young men, who\nraced them in Paris parks.\nBecause of the velocipedes were so hard to ride, no one thought about using them for\ntransportation. People didn’t ride velocipedes to the market or to their jobs. Instead, people\nthought velocipedes were just toys.\nAround 1870, American manufacturers saw that velocipedes were very popular overseas.\nThey began building velocipedes, too, but with one difference. They made the frameworks\nfrom hollow steel tubes. This alteration made velocipedes much lighter, but riders still had\nto work hard to pedal just a short distance. In addition, roads were bumpy so steering was\ndifficult. In fact, most riders preferred indoor tracks where they could rent a velocipede for a\nsmall fee and take riding lessons.\nSubsequent changes by British engineers altered the wheels to make pedaling more\nefficient. They saw that when a rider turned the pedals once, the front wheel turned once. If\nthe front wheel was small, the bicycle traveled just a small distance with each turn. They\nreasoned that if the front wheel were larger, the bicycle would travel a greater distance. So\nthey designed a bicycle with a giant front wheel. They made the rear wheel small. Its\nprimary purpose was to help the rider balance. Balancing was hard because the rider had\nto sit high above the giant front wheel in order to reach the pedals.\n \nThis meant he was in danger of falling off the bicycle and injuring himself if he lost his\nbalance. Despite this inherent danger, “high wheelers” became very popular in England.\nAmerican manufacturers once again tried to design a better bicycle. Their goal was to\nmake a safer bicycle. They substituted a small wheel for the giant front wheel and put the\ndriving mechanism in a r larger rear to wheel. It would be impossible for a rider to pedal the\nrear wheel, so engineers designed a system of foot levers.
