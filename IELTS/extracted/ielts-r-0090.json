  "passage_text": "Reading Practice\n \nChanging our understanding of health\nA\nThe concept of health holds different meanings for different people and groups. These\nmeanings of health have also changed overtime. This change is no more evident than in\nWestern society today, when notions of health and health promotion are being challenged\nand expanded in new ways.\nB\nFor much of recent Western history, health has been viewed in the physical sense only.\nThat is, good health has been connected to the smooth mechanical operation of the body,\nwhile ill health has been attributed to a breakdown in this machine. Health in this sense has\nbeen defined as the absence of disease or illness and is seen in medical terms. According\nto this view, creating health for people means providing medical care to treat or prevent\ndisease and illness. During this period, there was an emphasis on providing clean water,\nimproved sanitation and housing.\nC\nIn the late 1940s the World Health Organisation challenged this physically and medically\noriented view of health. They stated that 'health is a complete state of physical, mental and\nsocial well-being and is not merely the absence of disease' (WHO, 1946). Health and the\nperson were seen more holistically (mind/body/spirit) and not just in physical terms. \nD\nThe 1970s was a time of focusing on the prevention of disease and illness by emphasising\nthe importance of the lifestyle and behaviour of the individual. Specific behaviours which\nwere seen to increase risk of disease, such as smoking, lack of fitness and unhealthy\neating habits, were targeted. Creating health meant providing not only medical health care,\nbut health promotion programs and policies which would help people maintain healthy\nbehaviours and lifestyles. While this individualistic healthy lifestyles approach to health\nworked for some (the wealthy members of society), people experiencing poverty,\nunemployment, underemployment or little control over the conditions of their daily lives\nbenefited little from this approach. This was largely because both the healthy lifestyles\napproach and the medical approach to health largely ignored the social and environmental\nconditions affecting the health of people.\nE\nDuring 1980s and 1990s there has been a growing swing away from seeing lifestyle risks\nas the root cause of poor health. While lifestyle factors still remain important, health is\nbeing viewed also in terms of the social, economic and environmental contexts in which\npeople live. This broad approach to health is called the socio-ecological view of health. The\nbroad socio-ecological view of health was endorsed at the first International Conference of\nHealth Promotion held in 1986, Ottawa, Canada, where people from 38 countries agreed\nand declared that:\nThe fundamental conditions and resources for health are peace, shelter, education, food, a\n \n1\n\nviable income, a stable eco-system, sustainable resources, social justice and equity.\nImprovement in health requires a secure foundation in these basic requirements. (WHO,\n1986)\nIt is clear from this statement that the creation of health is about much more than\nencouraging healthy individual behaviours and lifestyles and providing appropriate medical\ncare. Therefore, the creation of health must include addressing issues such as poverty,\npollution, urbanisation, natural resource depletion, social alienation and poor working\nconditions. The social, economic and environmental contexts which contribute to the\ncreation of health do not operate separately or independently of each other. Rather, they\nare interacting and interdependent, and it is the complex interrelationships between them\nwhich determine the conditions that promote health. A broad socio-ecological view of\nhealth suggests that the promotion of health must include a strong social, economic and\nenvironmental focus.\nF\nAt the Ottawa Conference in 1986, a charter was developed which outlined new directions\nfor health promotion based on the socio-ecological view of health. This charter, known as\nthe Ottawa Charter for Health Promotion, remains as the backbone of health action today.\nIn exploring the scope of health promotion it states that:\nGood health is a major resource for social, economic and personal development and an\nimportant dimension of quality of life. Political, economic, social, cultural, environmental,\nbehavioural and biological factors can all favour health or be harmful to it. (WHO, 1986)\nThe Ottawa Charter brings practical meaning and action to this broad notion of health\npromotion. It presents fundamental strategies and approaches in achieving health for all.\nThe overall philosophy of health promotion which guides these fundamental strategies and\napproaches is one of 'enabling people to increase control over and to improve their health'\n(WHO, 1986).\n \n2",
