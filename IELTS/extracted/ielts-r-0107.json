This article chronicles\nthe design process and research involved in creating Nintendo DS for preschool gamers.\nAfter speaking with our producers who have a keen interest in designing for the DS, we\nfinally agreed on three key goals for our project. First, to understand the range of physical\nand cognitive abilities of preschoolers in the context of handheld system game play;\nsecond, to understand how preschool gamers interact with the DS, specifically how they\ncontrol the different forms of play and game mechanics offered by the games presently on\nthe market for this platform; third, to understand the expectation of preschooler’s parents\nconcerning the handheld systems as well as the purchase and play contexts within which\ngame play occurs. The team of research decided that in-home ethnographies with\npreschoolers and their families would yield comprehensive database with which to give our\nproducers more information and insights, so we start by conducting 26 in-home\nethnographies in three markets across the United States: an East coast urban/suburban\narea, a West coast urban/suburban area, and a Midwest suburban/rural area.\n \nThe subject is this study included 15 girls and 11 boys ranging from 3 years and 3 months\nold to 5 years and 11 months old. Also, because previous research had shown the effects\nof older siblings on game play (demonstrated, for example, by more advanced motor\ncoordination when using a computer mouse), households were employed to have a\ncombination of preschoolers with and without elder peers. In order to understand both\n“experienced” and “new” preschool users of the platform, we divided the sample so that 13\nfamilies owned at least one Nintendo DS and the others did not. For those households that\ndid not own a DS, one was brought to the interview for the kid to play. This allowed us to\nsee both the instinctive and intuitive movements of the new players (and of the more\nexperienced players when playing new games), as well as the learned movements of the\nmore experienced players. Each of those interviews took about 60 to 120 minutes and\nincluded the preschooler, at least one parent, and often siblings and another caregiver.\nThree kinds of information were collected after each interview. From any older siblings and\nthe parents that were available, we gathered data about: the buying decisions surrounding\ngame systems in the household, the family’s typical game play patterns, levels of parental\nmoderation with regard to computer gaming, and the most favorite games play by family\nmembers. We could also understand the ideology of gaming in these homes because of\nthese in-home interviews: what types of spaces were used for game play, how the system\nwere installed, where the handheld play occurred in the house (as well as on-the-go play),\nand the number and type of games and game systems owned. The most important is, we\ngathered the game-playing information for every single kid.\nBefore carrying out the interviews, the research team had closely discussed with the in-\nhouse game producers to create a list of game mechanics and problems tied to\npreschoolers’ motor and cognitive capabilities that were critical for them to understand prior\nto writing the games. These ranged from general dexterity issues related to game\ncontrollers to the effectiveness of in-game instructions to specific mechanics in current\ngames that the producers were interested in implementing for future preschool titles.\n \n1\n\nDuring the interviews, the moderator gave specific guidance to the preschooler through a\nseries of games, so that he or she could observe the interaction and probe both the\npreschooler and his or her parents on feelings, attitudes, and frustrations that arose in the\ndifferent circumstances.\n \nIf the subject in the experiment had previous exposure to the DS system, he or she was\nfirst asked to play his or her favorite game on the machine. This gave the researchers\ninformation about current level of gaming skill related to the complexity of the chosen one,\nallowing them to see the child playing a game with mechanics he or she was already\nfamiliar with. Across the 26 preschoolers, the Nintendo DS selections scope were very\nbroad, including New Super Mario Bros, Sonic Rush, Nintendogs, and Tony Hawk’s\nProving Ground. The interview observed the child play, noting preferences for game\nmechanic and motor interactions with device as well as the complexity level each game\nmechanic was for the tested subject. The researchers asked all of the preschoolers to play\nwith a specific game in consultation with our producers, The Little Mermaid: Ariel’s\nUndersea Adventure. The game was chosen for two major reasons. First, it was one of the\nfew games on the market with characters that appeal to this young age group. Second, it\nincorporated a large variety of mechanics that highlighted the uniqueness of the DS\nplatform, including using the microphone for blowing or singing.\nThe findings from this initial experiment were extensive. After reviewing the outcomes and\ndiscussing the implications for the game design with our internal game production team, we\nthen outlined the designing needs and presented the findings to a firm specializing in game\ndesign. We worked closely with those experts to set the game design for the two\npreschool-targeted DS games under development on what we had gathered.\nAs the two DS games went into the development process, a formative research course of\naction was set up. Whenever we developed new game mechanics, we brought\npreschoolers into our in-house utility lab to test the mechanics and to evaluate both their\nsimplicity, and whether they were engaging. We tested either alpha or beta versions of\ndifferent elements of the game, in addition to looking at overarching game structure. Once\na full version of the DS game was ready, we went back into the field test with a dozen\npreschoolers and their parents to make sure that each of the game elements worked for\nthe children, and that the overall objective of the game was understandable and the\nprocess was enjoyable for players. We also collected parent’s feedback on whether they\nthought the game is appropriate, engaging, and worth the purchase.\n \n2",
