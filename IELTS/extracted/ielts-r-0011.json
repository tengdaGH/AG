Carrier’s\ninvention made it possible to control temperature and humidity levels and so align the\ncolours. The invention also allowed industries such as film, processed food, textiles and\npharmaceuticals to improve the quality of their products.\nIn 1914, the first air-conditioning device was installed in a private house. However, its size,\nsimilar to that of an early computer, meant it took up too much space to come into\nwidespread use, and later models, such as the Weathermaker, which Carrier brought out in\nthe 1920s, cost too much for most people. Cooling for human comfort, rather than industrial\nneed, really took off when three air conditioners were installed in the J.L. Hudson\nDepartment Store in Detroit, Michigan. People crowded into the shop to experience the\nnew invention. The fashion spread from department stores to cinemas, whose income rose\nsteeply as a result of the comfort they provided.\nTo start with, money-conscious employers regarded air conditioning as a luxury. They\nconsidered that if they were paying people to work, they should not be paying for them to\nbe comfortable as well. So in the 1940s and ’50s, the industry started putting out a different\nmessage about its product: according to their research, installing air conditioning increased\nproductivity amongst employees. They found that typists increased their output by 24%\nwhen transferred from a regular office to a cooled one. Another study into office working\nconditions, which was carried out in the late ’50s, showed that the majority of companies\ncited air conditioning as the single most important contributor to efficiency in offices.\nHowever, air conditioning has its critics. Jed Brown, an environmentalist, complains that air\nconditioning is a factor in global warming. Unfortunately, he adds, because air conditioning\nleads to higher temperatures, people have to use it even more.
