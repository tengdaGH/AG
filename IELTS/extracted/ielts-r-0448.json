  "passage_text": "Reading Practice\n \nThe Clipper Races: an era of competition between cargo\nships\nDuring the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, the British East India Company had the\nmonopoly on trade with China and India. This meant that because no rival could legally\nimport tea or other goods from these countries at this time, the company was rarely in a\nhurry to transport its merchandise. Instead, its priority was to minimise costs by carrying as\nmuch as possible on each ship. This meant that its ships - known as East Indiamen - were\nenormous, strong and very slow.\nBy 1800, the average East Indiaman could carry 1,200 tons of merchandise. The trading\npattern for China tea usually meant the East Indiamen set sail from Britain in January,\nsailed round the Cape of Good Hope at the southernmost tip of Africa, and arrived in China\nin September. There they would load up that year's tea harvest, set off again and,\ndepending on the wind and weather, aim to arrive back by the following September. So\neven with favourable sailing conditions, the round trip lasted almost two years, and if\nanything went wrong it could take a lot longer.\nHowever, by 1834 the company had lost its trading monopolies, and tea had become a\nfreely traded item. Having no more use for its great ships, the company sold them off, and\nmany were bought by merchants or their captains, who continued to plough the seas\nbetween Britain and China. But now that tea could be traded freely, a few smart sailors\nbegan to realise that whoever brought each new harvest of tea to Britain first, stood to\nmake the most money.\n \n \nThis was partly because if you were home first, you could sell your shipment of tea before\nyour competitors even arrived, and partly because consumers in Britain in the nineteenth\ncentury believed that the fresher and earlier-picked the tea, the better the resulting drink.\nTea traders now needed faster, sleeker ships to bring their precious cargo back.\nNevertheless, in Britain this idea only caught on slowly, and white the 1840s saw a few\nfaster ships launched, for the time being many merchants remained satisfied with the slow\nbut reliable East Indiamen.\n \n \n \n \n \n \nIn fact it was the Americans who pioneered the first clipper ships. These vessels were fast\nand slender, with a narrow hull that was deeper at the back than at the front and masses of\nsails on tall masts. They earned their name from the way that they clipped off journey times\nBritish merchants resolved to build their own clippers to rival the Americans and the first\nBritish tea clipper, Stornaway, was built in Aberdeen in 1850 More tea clippers were\ndesigned and built in Britain throughout the 1850s and 1860s, they had a narrower beam\nthan their American equivalents, making them less powerful during storms, but faster in\ncalmer weather.\nThere was a great spirit of competition between the British and American ships plying the\ntea trade, but to begin with the Americans had the edge. Then in 1851 a British ship owner,\nRichard Green, built the aptly named clipper Challenger, with the stated intention of beating\nthe American ships. Loaded with tea, Challenger left China for London in 1852 at the same\ntime as the American clipper Challenge, a much larger, older ship, already greatly admired\nfor its speed. Large sums were bet on which would complete the journey first. In the event,\nthe British ship beat its rival to London by two days, amid much jubilation. From then on,\n \n1\n\nsuch international races grew in popularity.\nAfter 1855, American participation in the British tea trade gradually stopped. But even\nwithout the Anglo-American rivalry, the competitive spirit continued. It was really ignited\nwhen new ports were opened up for trade in China. These included Fouchow, which was\nmuch closer to the tea-producing areas than Canton, the port used previously. As a result,\ntea could be loaded onboard earlier and fresher, and the clippers could set off in late May\nor early June - sometimes not even taking time to fill out the official paperwork - racing\nback to Britain whatever the difficulties.\nThey sped down through the South China Sea and into the Indian Ocean, then raced to get\nround the southernmost tip of Africa at the Cape of Good Hope. Then it was north across\nthe vast Atlantic, past the Azores, through the English Channel and into the estuary of the\nRiver Thames. Once there, they would be towed by tugs, up the river and into the docks.\nThe cargo of the winning ship could earn a premium of up to sixpence per pound-and so\nthe captain and crew were rewarded by the owners of the cargo. But the races were about\nmore than just money the crews, about 40 men on each clipper, were expert sailors, proud\nof their ships, and they delighted in competing against each other. Without their\nenthusiasm, the races would never have happened, since getting the ship home as fast as\npossible required the crew to be totally dedicated and to sacrifice much of their rest for the\nduration of the race.\n \n2",
