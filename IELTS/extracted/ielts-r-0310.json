  "passage_text": "Reading Practice\n \nNeuroaesthetics\nAn emerging discipline called neuroaesthetics is seeking to bring scientific objectivity to the\nstudy of art, and has already given us a better understanding of many masterpieces. The\nblurred imagery of Impressionist paintings seems to stimulate the brain's amygdala, for\ninstance. Since the amygdala plays a crucial role in our feelings, that finding might explain\nwhy many people find these pieces so moving.\nCould the same approach also shed light on abstract twentieth-century pieces, from\nMondrian's geometrical blocks of colour, to Pollock's seemingly haphazard\narrangements of splashed paint on canvas? Sceptics believe that people claim to like such\nworks simply because they are famous. We certainly do have an inclination to follow the\ncrowd. When asked to make simple perceptual decisions such as matching a shape to its\nrotated image, for example, people often choose a definitively wrong answer if they see\nothers doing the same. It is easy to imagine that this mentality would have even more\nimpact on a fuzzy concept like art appreciation, where there is no right or wrong answer.\nAngelina Hawley-Dolan, of Boston College, Massachusetts, responded to this debate by\nasking volunteers to view pairs of paintings - either the creations of famous abstract artists\nor the doodles of infants, chimps and elephants. They then had to judge which they\npreferred. A third of the paintings were given no captions, while many were labelled\nincorrectly -volunteers might think they were viewing a chimp's messy brushstrokes when\nthey were actually seeing an acclaimed masterpiece. In each set of trials, volunteers\ngenerally preferred the work of renowned artists, even when they believed it was by an\nanimal or a child. It seems that the viewer can sense the artist's vision in paintings, even if\nthey can't explain why.\nRobert Pepperell, an artist based at Cardiff University, creates ambiguous works that are\nneither entirely abstract nor clearly representational. In one study, Pepperell and\nhis collaborators asked volunteers to decide how'powerful'they considered an artwork to\nbe, and whether they saw anything familiar in the piece. The longer they took to answer\nthese questions, the more highly they rated the piece under scrutiny, and the greater their\nneural activity. It would seem that the brain sees these images as puzzles, and the harder it\nis to decipher the meaning, the more rewarding is the moment of recognition.\nAnd what about artists such as Mondrian, whose paintings consist exclusively of horizontal\nand vertical lines encasing blocks of colour? Mondrian's works are deceptively simple,\nbut eye-tracking studies confirm that they are meticulously composed, and that simpiy\nrotating a piece radically changes the way we view it. With the originals, volunteers'eyes\ntended to stay longer on certain places in the image, but with the altered versions they\nwould flit across a piece more rapidly. As a result, the volunteers considered the altered\nversions less pleasurable when they later rated the work.\nIn a similar study, Oshin Vartanian of Toronto University asked volunteers to compare\noriginal paintings with ones which he had altered by moving objects around within the\nframe. He found that almost everyone preferred the original, whether it was a Van Gogh\nstill life or an abstract by Miro. Vartanian also found that changing the composition of the\npaintings reduced activation in those brain areas linked with meaning and interpretation.\nIn another experiment, Alex Forsythe of the University of Liverpool analysed the visual\n \n1\n\nintricacy of different pieces of art, and her results suggest that many artists use a key level\nof detail to please the brain. Too little and the work is boring, but too much results in a kind\nof 'perceptual overload', according to Forsythe. What's more, appealing pieces both\nabstract and representational, show signs of 'fractals' - repeated motifs recurring in different\nscales, fractals are common throughout nature, for example in the shapes of mountain\npeaks or the branches of trees. It is possible that our visual system, which evolved in the\ngreat outdoors, finds it easier to process such patterns.\nIt is also intriguing that the brain appears to process movement when we see a handwritten\nletter, as if we are replaying the writer's moment of creation. This has led some to\nwonder whether Pollock's works feel so dynamic because the brain reconstructs the\nenergetic actions the artist used as he painted. This may be down to our brain's 'mirror\nneurons', which are known to mimic others' actions. The hypothesis will need to be\nthoroughly tested, however. It might even be the case that we could use neuroaesthetic\nstudies to understand the longevity of some pieces of artwork. While the fashions of the\ntime might shape what is currently popular, works that are best adapted to our visual\nsystem may be the most likely to linger once the trends of previous generations have been\nforgotten.\nIt's still early days for the field of neuroaesthetics - and these studies are probably only a\ntaste of what is to come. It would, however, be foolish to reduce art appreciation to a set of\nscientific laws. We shouldn't underestimate the importance of the style of a particular artist,\ntheir place in history and the artistic environment of their time. Abstract art offers both a\nchallenge and the freedom to play with different interpretations. In some ways, it's not so\ndifferent to science, where we are constantly looking for systems and decoding meaning so\nthat we can view and appreciate the world in a new way.\n \n2",
