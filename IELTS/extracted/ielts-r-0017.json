  "passage_text": "Reading Practice\n \nAlternative Medicine in Australia\nThe first students to study alternative medicine at university level in Australia began their\nfour-year, full-time course at the University of Technology, Sydney, in early 1994. Their\ncourse covered, among other therapies, acupuncture. The theory they learnt is based on\nthe traditional Chinese explanation of this ancient healing art: that it can regulate the flow of\n‘Qi’ or energy through pathways in the body. This course reflects how far some alternative\ntherapies have come in their struggle for acceptance by the medical establishment.\nAustralia has been unusual in the Western world in having a very conservative attitude to\nnatural or alternative therapies, according to Dr Paul Laver, a lecturer in Public Health at\nthe University of Sydney. ‘We’ve had a tradition of doctors being fairly powerful and I guess\nthey are pretty loath to allow any pretenders to their position to come into it.’ In many other\nindustrialized countries, orthodox and alternative medicines have worked ‘hand in glove’ for\nyears. In Europe, only orthodox doctors can prescribe herbal medicine. In Germany, plant\nremedies account for 10% of the national turnover of pharmaceutical. Americans made\nmore visits to alternative therapist than to orthodox doctors in 1990, and each year they\nspend about $US 12 billion on the therapies that have not been scientifically tested.\nDisenchantment with orthodox medicine has seen the popularity of alternative therapies in\nAustralia climb steadily during the past 20 years. In a 1983 national health survey, 1.9% of\npeople said they had contacted a chiropractor, naturopath, osteopath, acupuncturist or\nherbalist in the two weeks prior to the survey. By 1990, this figure had risen to 2.6% of the\npopulation. The 550,000 consultations with alternative therapists reported in the 1990\nsurvey represented about an eighth of the total number of consultations with medically\nqualified personnel covered by the survey, according to Dr Laver and colleagues writing in\nthe Australian Journal of Public Health in 1993. ‘A better educated and less accepting\npublic has become disillusion with the experts in general and increasingly skeptical about\nscience and empirically based knowledge,’ they said. ‘The high standing of professionals,\nincluding doctors, has been eroded as a consequence.’\nRather than resisting or criticizing this trend, increasing numbers of Australian doctors,\nparticularly younger ones, are forming group practices with alternative therapists or taking\ncourses themselves, particularly in acupuncture and herbalism. Part of the incentive was\nfinancial, Dr Laver said. ‘The bottom line is that most general practitioners are business\npeople. If they see potential clientele going elsewhere, they might want to be able to offer a\nsimilar service.’\nIn 1993, Dr Laver and his colleagues published a survey of 289 Sydney people who\nattended eight alternative therapists’ practices in Sydney. These practices offered a wide\nrange of alternative therapies from 25 therapists. Those surveyed had experience chronic\nillnesses, for which orthodox medicine had been able to provide little relief. They\ncommented that they liked the holistic approach of their alternative therapists and the\nfriendly, concerned and detailed attention they had received. The cold, impersonal manner\nof orthodox doctors featured in the survey. An increasing exodus from their clinics, coupled\nwith this and a number of other relevant surveys carried out in Australia, all pointing to\northodox doctors’ inadequacies, have led mainstream doctors themselves to begin to admit\nthey could learn from the personal style of alternative therapists. Dr Patrick Store,\n \n1\n\nPresident of the Royal College of General Practitioners, concurs that orthodox doctors\ncould learn a lot about beside manner and advising patients on preventative health from\nalternative therapists.\nAccording to the Australian Journal of Public Health, 18% of patients visiting alternative\ntherapists do so because they suffer from musculo-skeletal complaints; 12% suffer from\ndigestive problems, which is only 1% more than those suffering from emotional problems.\nThose suffering from respiratory complaints represent 7% of their patients, and candida\nsufferers represent an equal percentage. Headache sufferers and those complaining of\ngeneral ill health represent 6% and 5% of patients respectively, and a further 4% see\ntherapists for general health maintenance.\nThe survey suggested that complementary medicine is probably a better term than\nalternative medicine.
