  "passage_text": "Reading Practice\n \n \nLearning by Examples\n \nA Learning Theory is rooted in the work of Ivan Pavlov, the famous scientist who\ndiscovered and documented the principles governing how animals (humans included) learn\nin the 1900s. Two basic kinds of learning or conditioning occur, one of which is famously\nknown as the classical conditioning. Classical conditioning happens when an animal learns\nto associate a neutral stimulus (signal) with a stimulus that has intrinsic meaning based on\nhow closely in time the two stimuli are presented. The classic example of classical\nconditioning is a dog's ability to associate the sound of a bell (something that originally has\nno meaning to the dog) with the presentation of food (something that has a lot of meaning\nto the dog) a few moments later. Dogs are able to learn the association between bell and\nfood, and will salivate immediately after hearing the bell once this connection has been\nmade. Years of learning research have led to the creation of a highly precise learning\ntheory that can be used to understand and predict how and under what circumstances\nmost any animal will learn, including human beings, and eventually help people figure out\nhow to change their behaviours.\n \nB Role models are a popular notion for guiding child development, but in recent years very\ninteresting research has been done on learning by examples in other animals. If the subject\nof animal learning is taught very much in terms of classical or operant conditioning, it\nplaces too much emphasis on how we allow animals to learn and not enough on how they\nare equipped to learn. To teach a course of mine, I have been dipping profitably into a very\ninteresting and accessible compilation of papers on social learning in mammals, including\nchimps and human children, edited by Heyes and Galef (1996).\n \nC The research reported in one paper started with a school field trip to Israel to a pine\nforest where many pine cones were discovered, stripped to the central core. So the\ninvestigation started with no weighty theoretical intent, but was directed at finding out what\nwas eating the nutritious pine seeds and how they managed to get them out of the cones.\nThe culprit proved to be the versatile and athletic black rat,(Rattus rattus), and the\ntechnique was to bite each cone scale off at its base, in sequence from base to tip following\nthe spiral growth pattern of the cone.\n \nD Urban black rats were found to lack the skill and were unable to learn it even if housed\nwith experienced cone strippers. However, infants of urban mothers cross-fostered by\nstripper mothers acquired the skill, whereas infants of stripper mothers fostered by an\nurban mother could not. Clearly the skill had to be learned from the mother. Further elegant\nexperiments showed that naive adults could develop the skill if they were provided with\ncones from which the first complete spiral of scales had been removed; rather like our new\nphotocopier which you can work out how to use once someone has shown you how to\nswitch it on. In the case of rats, the youngsters take cones away from the mother when she\nis still feeding on them, allowing them to acquire the complete stripping skill.\n \nE A good example of adaptive bearing we might conclude, but let’s see the economies.\nThis was determined by measuring oxygen uptake of a rat stripping a cone in a metabolic\nchamber to calculate energetic cost and comparing it with the benefit of the pine seeds\nmeasured by calorimeter. The cost proved to be less than 10% of the energetic value of the\ncone. An acceptable profit margin.\nF A paper in 1996, Animal Behaviour by Bednekoff and Baida, provides a different view of\n \n1\n\n \nthe adaptiveness of social learning. It concerns the seed caching behaviour of Clark's\nNutcracker (Nucifraga columbiana) and the Mexican Jay (Aphelocoma ultramarina). The\nformer is a specialist, caching 30,000 or so seeds in scattered locations that it will recover\nover the months of winter; the Mexican Jay will also cache food but is much less dependent\nupon this than the Nutcracker. The two species also differ in their social structure: the\nNutcracker being rather solitary while the Jay forages in social groups.\nG The experiment is to discover not just whether a bird can remember where it hid a seed\nbut also if it can remember where it saw another bird hide a seed. The design is slightly\ncomical with a cacher bird wandering about a room with lots of holes in the floor hiding food\nin some of the holes, while watched by an observer bird perched in a cage. Two days later,\ncachers and observers are tested for their discovery rate against an estimated random\nperformance. In the role of cacher, not only the Nutcracker but also the less specialised Jay\nperformed above chance; more surprisingly, however, jay observers were as successful as\njay cachers whereas nutcracker observers did no better than chance. It seems that,\nwhereas the Nutcracker is highly adapted at remembering where it hid its own seeds, the\nsocial living Mexican Jay is more adept at remembering, and so exploiting, the caches of\nothers.\n \n2",
