Jonathan Chapman, a senior lecturer at the University of Brighton, UK, is one of a new\nbreed of “sustainable designers’. Like many of us, they are concerned about the huge\nwaste associated with Western consumer culture and the damage this does to the\nenvironment. Some, like Chapman, aim to create objects we will want to keep rather than\ndiscard. Others are working to create more efficient or durable consumer goods or goods\ndesigned with recycling in mind. The waste entailed in our fleeting relationships with\nconsumer durables is colossal\nB. Domestic power tools, such as electric drills, are a typical example of such waste.\nHowever much DIY the purchaser plans to do, the truth is that these things are thrown\naway having been used, on average, for just ten minutes. Most will serve conscience time,\ngathering dust on a shelf in the garage; people are reluctant to admit that they have wasted\ntheir money. However, the end is inevitable for thousands of years in landfill waste sites. In\nits design, manufacture, packaging, transportation, and disposal, a power tool consumes\nmany times its own weight in resources, all for a shorter active lifespan than that of the\naverage small insect.\nC. To understand why we have become so wasteful, we should look to the underlying\nmotivation of consumers. ‘People own things to give expression to who they are and to\nshow what group of people they feel they belong to’ Chapman says. In a world of mass\nproduction, however, that symbolism has lost much of its potency. For most of human\nhistory, people had an intimate relationship with objects they used or treasured. Often they\nmade the objects themselves, or family members passed them on. For more specialist\nobjects, people relied on expert manufacturers living close by, whom they probably knew\npersonally. Chapman points out that all these factors gave objects a history – a narrative –\nand an emotional connection that today’s mass production cannot match. Without these\npersonal connections, consumerist culture instead of idolizes novelty. We know we can’t\nbuy happiness, but the chance to remake ourselves with glossy, box-fresh products seems\nirresistible. When the novelty fades we simply renew the excitement by buying more new\nstuff: what John Thackara of Doors of Perception, a network for sharing ideas about the\nfuture of design, calls the “schlock of the new”.\nD. As a sustainable designer, Chapman’s solution is what he calls “emotionally durable\ndesign”. Think about your favourite old jeans. They just don’t have the right feel until they\nhave been worn and washed a hundred times, do they? It is like they are sharing your life\nstory. You can fake that look, but it isn’t the same. Chapman says the gradual unfolding of\na relationship like this transforms our interactions with objects into something richer than\nsimple utility. Swiss industrial analyst Walter Stahel, visiting professor at the University of\nSurrey, calls it the “teddy-bear factor”. No matter how ragged and worn a favourite teddy\nbecomes, we don’t rush out and buy another one. As adults, our teddy bear connects us to\nour childhoods, and this protects it from obsolescence Stahel says this is what sustainable\ndesign needs to do.\nE. It is not simply about making durable items that people want to keep. Sustainable design\n \n1\n\nis a matter of properly costing the whole process of production, energy use, and disposal.\n“It is about the design of systems, the design of culture,” says Tim Cooper from the Centre\nfor Sustainable Consumption at Sheffield Hallam University in Britain. He thinks sustainable\ndesign has been “surprisingly slow to take off” but says looming environmental crises and\nresource depletion are pushing it to the top of the agenda.\nF. Thackara agrees. For him, the roots of impending environmental collapse can be\nsummarized in two words: weight and speed. We are making more stuff than the planet\ncan sustain and using vast amounts of energy moving more and more of it around ever\nfaster. The Information Age was supposed to lighten our economies and reduce our impact\non the environment, but the reverse seems to be happening. We have simply added\ninformation technology to the industrial era and hastened the developed world’s\nmetabolism, Thackara argues.\nG. Once you grasp that, the cure is hardly rocket science: minimize waste and energy use,\nstop moving stuff around so much and use people more. EZIO MANZINI, Professor of\nindustrial design at Politecnico di Milano University, Italy, describes the process of moving\nto a post-throwaway society as “changing the engine of an aircraft in mid-flight’ Even so, he\nbelieves it can be done, and he is not alone.\nH. Manzini says a crucial step would be to redesign our globalized world into what he calls\nthe “multi-local society”. His vision is that every resource, from food to electricity\ngeneration, should as far as possible be sourced and distributed locally. These local hubs\nwould then be connected to national and global networks to allow the most efficient use\nand flow of materials.\nI. So what will post-throwaway consumerism look like? For a start, we will increasingly buy\nsustainably designed products. This might be as simple as installing energy-saving light\nbulbs, more efficient washing machines, or choosing locally produced groceries with less\npackaging.\nJ. We will spend less on material goods and more on services. Instead of buying a second\ncar, for example, we might buy into a car-sharing network. We will also buy less and rent a\nwhole lot more: why own things that you hardly use especially things that are likely to be\nupdated all the time? Consumer durables will be sold with plans already in place for their\ndisposal. Electronic goods will be designed to be recyclable, with the extra cost added to\nthe retail price as prepayment. As consumers become increasingly concerned about the\nenvironment, many big businesses are eagerly adopting sustainable design and brushing\nup their green credentials to please their customers and stay one step ahead of the\ncompetition.\n \n2",
