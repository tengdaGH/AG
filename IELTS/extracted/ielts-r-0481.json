  "passage_text": "Reading Practice\n \nThe Great Australian Fence\nA war has been going on for almost a hundred years between the sheep farmers of\nAustralia and the dingo, Australia’s wild dog. To protect their livelihood, the farmers built a\nwire fence, 3,307 miles of continuous wire mesh, reaching from the coast of South\nAustralia all the way to the cotton fields of eastern Queensland, just short of the Pacific\nOcean.\nThe Fence is Australia’s version of the Great Wall of China, but even longer, erected to\nkeep out hostile invaders, in this case hordes of yellow dogs. The empire it preserves is\nthat of the woolgrowers, sovereigns of the world’s second largest sheep flock, after China’s\n- some 123 million head - and keepers of a wool export business worth four billion dollars.\nNever mind that more and more people - conservationists, politicians, taxpayers and\nanimal lovers - say that such a barrier would never be allowed today on ecological grounds.\nWith sections of it almost a hundred years old, the dog fence has become, as\nconservationist Lindsay Fairweather ruefully admits, ‘an icon of Australian frontier\ningenuity’.\nTo appreciate this unusual outback monument and to meet the people whose livelihoods\ndepend on it, I spent part of an Australian autumn travelling the wire. It’s known by different\nnames in different states: the Dog Fence in South Australia, the Border Fence in New\nSouth Wales and the Barrier Fence in Queensland. I would call it simply the Fence.\nFor most of its prodigious length, this epic fence winds like a river across a landscape that,\nunless a big rain has fallen, scarcely has rivers. The eccentric route, prescribed mostly by\nproperty lines, provides a sampler of outback topography: the Fence goes over sand\ndunes, past salt lakes, up and down rock-strewn hills, through dense scrub and across\nbarren plains.\n \n \nThe Fence stays away from towns. Where it passes near a town, it has actually become a\ntourist attraction visited on bus tours. It marks the traditional dividing line between cattle\nand sheep. Inside, where the dingoes are legally classified as vermin, they are shot,\npoisoned and trapped. Sheep and dingoes do not mix and the Fence sends that message\nmile after mile.\nWhat is this creature that by itself threatens an entire industry, inflicting several millions of\ndollars of damage a year despite the presence of the world’s most obsessive fence?\nCousin to the coyote and the jackal, descended from the Asian wolf, Cam's lupus dingo is\nan introduced species of wild dog. Skeletal remains indicate that the dingo was introduced\nto Australia more than 3,500 years ago probably with Asian seafarers who landed on the\nnorth coast. The adaptable dingo spread rapidly and in a short time became the top\npredator, killing off all its marsupial competitors. The dingo looks like a small wolf with a\nlong nose, short pointed ears and a bushy tail. Dingoes rarely bark; they yelp and howl.\nStanding about 22 inches at the shoulder - slightly taller than a coyote - the dingo is\nAustralia’s largest land carnivore.\nThe woolgrowers’ war against dingoes, which is similar to the sheep ranchers’ rage against\ncoyotes in the US, started not long after the first European settlers disembarked in 1788,\nbringing with them a cargo of sheep. Dingoes officially became outlaws in 1830 when\ngovernments placed a bounty on their heads. Today bounties for problem dogs killing\n \n1\n\nsheep inside the Fence can reach $500. As pioneers penetrated the interior with their\nflocks of sheep, fences replaced shepherds until, by the end of the 19th century, thousands\nof miles of barrier fencing crisscrossed the vast grazing lands.\nThe dingo started out as a quiet observer,’ writes Roland Breckwoldt, in A Very Elegant\nAnimal: The Dingo, ‘but soon came to represent everything that was dark and dangerous\non the continent.’ It is estimated that since sheep arrived in Australia, dingo numbers have\nincreased a hundredfold. Though dingoes have been eradicated from parts of Australia, an\neducated guess puts the population at more than a million.\nEventually government officials and graziers agreed that one well-maintained fence, placed\non the outer rim of sheep country and paid for by taxes levied on woolgrowers, should\nsupplant the maze of private netting. By 1960, three states joined their barriers to form a\nsingle dog fence.\nThe intense private battles between woolgrowers and dingoes have usually served to\ndefine the Fence only in economic terms. It marks the difference between profit and loss.\nYet the Fence casts a much broader ecological shadow for it has become a kind of\nterrestrial dam, deflecting the flow of animals inside and out. The ecological side effects\nappear most vividly at Sturt National Park. In 1845, explorer Charles Sturt led an expedition\nthrough these parts on a futile search for an inland sea. For Sturt and other early explorers,\nit was a rare event to see a kangaroo. Now they are ubiquitous for without a native predator\nthe kangaroo population has exploded inside the Fence. Kangaroos are now cursed more\nthan dingoes. They have become the rivals of sheep, competing for water and grass. In\nresponse state governments cull* more than three million kangaroos a year to keep\nAustralia’s national symbol from overrunning the pastoral lands.
