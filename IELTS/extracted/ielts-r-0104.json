  "passage_text": "Reading Practice\n \nCommunicating Styles and Conflict\n \nKnowing your communication style and having a mix of styles on your team can provide a\npositive force for resolving conflict.\n \nA As  far  back  as  Hippocrates’ time  (460-370B.C.),  people  have  tried  to understand\nother people by characterizing them according to personality type or\ntemperament.Hippocrates believed there were four different body fluids that influenced four\nbasic types of temperament. His work was further developed 500 years later by Galen.\nThese days there are any number of self-assessment tools that relate to the basic\ndescriptions developed by Galen, although we no longer believe the source to be the types\nof body fluid that dominate our systems.\n \nB The  values  in  self-assessments  that  help  determine  personality  style. Learning\nstyles, communication styles, conflict-handling styles, or other aspects of individuals is that\nthey help depersonalize conflict in interpersonal relationships. The depersonalization\noccurs when you realize that others aren’t trying to be difficult, but they need different or\nmore information than you do. They’re not intending to be rude: they are so focused on the\ntask they forget about greeting people. They would like to work faster but not at the risk of\ndamaging the relationships needed to get the job done. They understand there is a job to\ndo. But it can only be done right with the appropriate information, which  takes  time  to \ncollect. When  used  appropriately,  understanding communication styles can help resolve\nconflict on teams. Very rarely are conflicts true personality issues. Usually they are issues\nof style, information needs, or focus.\n \nC Hippocrates and later Galen determined there were four basic temperaments: sanguine,\nphlegmatic, melancholic and choleric. These descriptions were developed centuries ago\nand are still somewhat apt, although you could update the wording. In today’s world, they\ntranslate into the four fairly common communication styles described below:\n \nD The sanguine person would be the expressive or spirited style of communication. These\npeople speak in pictures. They invest a lot of emotion and energy in their communication\nand often speak quickly. Putting their whole body into it. They are easily sidetracked onto a\nstory that may or may not illustrate the point they are trying to make. Because of their\nenthusiasm, they are great team motivators. They are concerned about people and\nrelationships. Their high levels of energy can come on strong at times and their focus is\nusually on the bigger picture, which means they sometimes miss the details or the proper\norder of things. These people find conflict or differences of opinion invigorating and love to\nengage in a spirited discussion. They love change and are constantly looking for new and\nexciting adventures.\nE Tile phlegmatic person - cool and persevering - translates into the technical or systematic\ncommunication style. This style of communication is focused on facts and technical details.\nPhlegmatic people have an orderly methodical way of approaching tasks, and their focus is\nvery much on the task, not on the people, emotions, or concerns that the task may evoke.\nThe focus is also more on the details necessary to accomplish a task. Sometimes the\ndetails overwhelm the big picture and focus needs to be brought back to the context of the\ntask. People with this style think the facts should speak for themselves, and they are not as\ncomfortable with conflict. They need time to adapt to change and need to understand both\nthe logic of it and the steps involved.\n \n1\n\n \n \nF Tile melancholic person who is soft hearted and oriented toward doing things for others\ntranslates into the considerate or sympathetic communication style. A person with this\ncommunication style is focused on people and relationships. They are good listeners and\ndo things for other people-sometimes to the detriment of getting things done for\nthemselves. They want to solicit everyone’s opinion and make sure everyone is\ncomfortable with whatever is required to get the job done. At times this focus on others can\ndistract from the task at hand. Because they are so concerned with the needs of others and\nsmoothing over issues, they do not like conflict. They believe that change threatens the\nstatus quo and tends to make people feel uneasy, so people with this communication style,\nlike phlegmatic people need time to consider the changes in order to adapt to them.\n \nG The choleric temperament translates into the bold or direct style of communication.\nPeople with this style are brief in their communication - the fewer words the better. They\nare big picture thinkers and love to be involved in many things at once. They are focused\non tasks and outcomes and often forget that the people involved in carrying out the tasks\nhave needs. They don’t do detail work easily and as a result can often underestimate how\nmuch time it takes to achieve the task. Because they are so direct, they often seem forceful\nand can be very intimidating to others. They usually would welcome someone challenging\nthem. But most other styles are afraid to do so. They also thrive on change, the more the\nbetter.\nH A well-functioning team should have all of these communication styles for true\neffectiveness. All teams need to focus on the task, and they need to take care of\nrelationships in order to achieve those tasks. They need the big picture perspective or the\ncontext of their work, and they need the details to be identified and taken care of for\nsuccess. We all have aspects of each style within us. Some of us can easily move from\none style to another and adapt our style to the needs of the situation at hand-whether the\nfocus is on tasks or relationships. For others, a dominant style is very evident, and it is\nmore challenging to see the situation from the perspective of another style. The work\nenvironment can influence communication styles either by the type of work that is required\nor by the predominance of one style reflected in that environment. Some people use one\nstyle at work and another at home.\nThe good news about communication styles is that we have the ability to develop flexibility\nin our styles. The greater the flexibility we have, the more skilled we usually are at handling\npossible and actual conflicts. Usually it has to be relevant to us to do so, either because we\nthink it is important or because there are incentives in our environment to encourage it. The\nkey is that we have to want to become flexible with our communication style. As Henry\nFord said, “Whether you think you can or you can’t, you’re right!”\n \n2",
