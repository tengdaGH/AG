  "passage_text": "Reading Practice\n \nMind Music\nScientists investigate 'earworms', the music we can't get out of our head\nA Ever had a song stuck in your head, playing on an endless loop? Scientists call them\n'involuntary musical images', or 'earworms, and a wave of new research is shining light on\nwhy they occur and what can be learned from them. Some neuroscientists and cognitive\npsychologists are studying earworms to explore the mysteries of memory and the part of\nthe brain that is beyond our conscious control. The idea that we have full control over our\nthought processes is an illusion,' says psychologist Lauren Stewart, who founded the\nmaster's program in music, mind and brain at Goldsmiths, University of London, UK, where\nrecent research has taken place. Researchers haven't been able to watch what happens in\nthe brain when earworms occur, because they happen unpredictably. Much of what is\nknown about them comes from surveys, questionnaires, diaries and lab experiments.\nB A Goldsmiths study published in the journal Memory and Cognition this year showed that\nthe singing we hear in our heads tends to be true to actual recordings. Researchers had 17\nvolunteers tap to the beat of any earworm they heard during a four-day period while a\ndevice attached to their wrist recorded their movements. The tapping tempos were within\n10% of the tempos of the original recordings. Another Goldsmiths study, published this\nyear in Consciousness and Cognition, found that people who report hearing earworms\noften, and find them most intrusive, have slightly different brain structures, with more gray\nmatter in areas associated with processing emotions.\nC Studies also show that the music in our heads often starts playing during times of 'low\ncognitive load', such as while showering, getting dressed, walking, or doing chores. Dr\nStewart likens earworms to 'sonic screen savers' that keep the mind entertained while it is\notherwise unoccupied. She and her colleagues tested that theory by having volunteers\nlisten to songs and giving them various tasks afterwards. The volunteers who sat idly for\nthe next five minutes were the most likely to report hearing the music m their heads. Dr\nStewart observed that the more challenging the activity, the less likely the volunteers were\nto hear the music. Diary studies also show songs tend to match people's moods and\ntherefore they are not random. If you are energized and upbeat, an earworm that occurs is\nlikely to be uptempo too.\nD Songs the brain fixates on are usually those it has been exposed to recently, surveys\nshow, which is why tunes getting heavy radio play frequently top the earworm charts. Even\ntunes you may have heard but didn't pay attention to can worm their way into your\nsubconscious, says Ira Hyman, a psychologist at Western Washington University in\nBellingham, USA. In an unpublished study there, participants who listened to music while\ndoing other tasks were more likely to report that the songs returned as earworms later on,\ncompared with participants who simply listened.\nE Some earworms are just fragments of a song that repeat like a broken record. So, when\nthe mind hits a part of a song it can't remember, it loops back rather than moving on. That\ncould make an earworm even more entrenched, Dr Hyman says. According to a theory\nknown as the Zeigarik effect, named for a Soviet psychologist, Bluma Zeigarnik, unfinished\nthoughts and activities weigh on the mind more heavily than those that are completed,\nalthough experiments exposing students to interrupted songs have yielded mixed results.\n \n1\n\nF Researchers say they can't pinpoint a spot in the brain where earworms live. Imaging\nstudies by Andrea Halpern at Bucknell University, in Lewisburg, USA, have shown that\ndeliberately imagining music and actually listening to music activate many of the same\nneurological networks. Dr Halpern's earlier studies showed that when subjects listened to\nthe first few notes of familiar music, areas in the right frontal and superior temporal portions\nof the brain became activated, along with the supplementary motor area at the top, which is\ntypically involved in remembering sequences. When the same subjects listened to\nunfamiliar music and were asked to recall it, there was activity in the left frontal portions of\nthe brain instead.\nG One factor that makes some songs stick might be repetition. 'Repetition leads to\nfamiliarity which leads to anticipation, which is satisfied by hearing the song,' says John\nSeabrook, author of The Song Machine: Inside the Hit Factory, about how producers pump\npop songs full of aural \"hooks', the punchy melodic phrases designed to target the brain\nand leave it wanting more. The researchers are comparing the melodic structure of 100\noften-mentioned songs with 100 similarly popular songs that weren't cited as earworms, to\nassess the difference. Songs with earworm potential appear to share certain features: a\nrepeating pattern of ups and downs in pitch, and an irregular musical interval.\nH The researchers plan next to test their results in reverse, and play ringtones from songs\nof both the earworm and non earworm variety for volunteers several times a day to see\nwhich ones get stuck. Drs Stewart and Halper are now working together to recruit survey\nparticipants for a study looking at whether people at different stages of life experience\nearworms differently. 'You can argue that older people might get them more often because\nthey know more songs,' Dr Halpern says. 'But the few responses we have so far indicate\nthat they have earworms less often. It could be that they don't play music as often as\nyounger people do.\n \n2",
