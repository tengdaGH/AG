  "passage_text": "Reading Practice\n \nChildren’s Literature\nStories and poems aimed at children have an exceedingly long history:lullabies, for\nexample, were sung in Roman times, and a few nursery games and rhymes are almost as\nancient. Yet so far as written-down literature is concerned, while there were stories in print\nbefore 1700 that children often seized on when they had the chance, such as translations\nof Aesop’s fables, fairy-stories and popular ballads and romances, these were not aimed at\nyoung people in particular. Since the only genuinely child-oriented literature at this time\nwould have been a few instructional works to help with reading and general knowledge,\nplus the odd Puritanical tract as an aid to morality, the only course for keen child readers\nwas to read adult literature. This still occurs today, especially with adult thrillers or\nromances that include more exciting, graphic detail than is normally found in the literature\nfor younger readers.\nBy the middle of the 18th century there were enough eager child readers, andenough\nparents glad to cater to this interest, for publishers to specialize in children’s books whose\nfirst aim was pleasure rather than education or morality. In Britain, a London merchant\nnamed Thomas Boreham produced Cajanus, The Swedish Giant in 1742, while the more\nfamous John Newbery published A Little Pretty Pocket Book in 1744.1ts contents—rhymes,\nstories, children’s games plus a free gift (‘A ball and a pincushion’)——in many ways\nanticipated the similar lucky-dip contents of children’s annuals this century. It is a tribute to\nNewbery’s flair that he hit upon a winning formula quite so quickly, to be pirated almost\nimmediately in America.\nSuch pleasing levity was not to last. Influenced by Rousseau, whose Emile(1762) decreed\nthat all books for children save Robinson Crusoe were a dangerous diversion,\ncontemporary critics saw to it that children’s literature should be instructive and uplifting.\nProminent among such voices was Mrs. Sarah Trimmer, whose magazine The Guardian of\nEducation (1802) carried the first regular reviews of children’s books. It was she who\ncondemned fairy-tales for their violence and general absurdity; her own stories, Fabulous\nHistories  (1786) described talking animals who were always models of sense and\ndecorum.\nSo the moral story for children was always threatened from within, given the way children\nhave of drawing out entertainment from the sternest moralist. But the greatest blow to the\nimproving children’s book was to come from an unlikely source indeed: early 19th century\ninterest in folklore. Both nursery rhymes, selected by James Orchard Halliwell for a folklore\nsociety in 1842, and collection of fairy-stories by the scholarly Grimm brothers, swiftly\ntranslated into English in 1823,soon rocket to popularity with the young, quickly leading to\nnew editions, each one more child-centered than the last. From now on younger children\ncould expect stories written for their particular interest and with the needs of their own\nlimited experience of life kept well to the fore.\nWhat eventually determined the reading of older children was often not the availability of\nspecial children’s literature as such but access to books that contained characters, such as\nyoung people or animals, with whom they could more easily empathize, or action, such as\nexploring or fighting, that made few demands on adult maturity or understanding.\nThe final apotheosis of literary childhood as something to be protected from unpleasant\nreality came with the arrival in the late 1930s of child-centered best-sellers intend on\n \n1\n\nentertainment at its most escapist. In Britain novelist such as Enid Blyton and Richmal\nCrompton described children  who were always free to have the most unlikely adventures,\nsecure in the knowledge that nothing bad could ever happen to them in the end. The fact\nthat war broke out again during her books’ greatest popularity fails to register at all in the\nself-enclosed world inhabited by Enid Blyton’s young characters. Reaction against such \ndream-worlds  was  inevitable  after World War II, coinciding with the growth of paperback\nsales, children’s libraries and a new spirit of moral and social concern. Urged on by\ncommitted publishers and progressive librarians, writers slowly began to explore new areas\nof interest while also shifting the settings of their plots from the middle-class world to which\ntheir chiefly adult patrons had always previously belonged.\nCritical emphasis, during this development, has been divided. For some the most important\ntask was to rid children’s books of the social prejudice and exclusiveness no longer found\nacceptable. Others concentrated more on the positive achievements of contemporary\nchildren’s literature. That writers of these works are now often recommended to the\nattentions of adult as well as child readers echoes the 19th-century belief that children’s\nliterature can be shared by the generations, rather than being a defensive barrier between\nchildhood and the necessary growth towards adult understanding.\n \n2",
