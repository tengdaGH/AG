  "passage_text": "Reading Practice\n \nChildren with auditory problems\nA\nHearing impairment or other auditory function deficit in young children can have a major\nimpact on their development of speech and communication, resulting in a detrimental effect\non their ability to learn at school. This is likely to have major consequences for the\nindividual and the population as a whole. The New Zealand Ministry of Health has found\nfrom research carried out over two decades that 6-10% of children in that country are\naffected by hearing loss.\nB\nA preliminary study in New Zealand has shown that classroom noise presents a major\nconcern for teachers and pupils. Modern teaching practices, the organisation of desks in\nthe classroom, poor classroom acoustics, and mechanical means of ventilation such as air-\nconditioning units all contribute to the number of children unable to comprehend\nthe teacher's voice. Education researchers Nelson and Soli have also suggested that\nrecent trends in learning often involve collaborative interaction of multiple minds and tools\nas much as individual possession of information. This all amounts to heightened activity\nand noise levels, which have the potential to be particularly serious for children\nexperiencing auditory function deficit. Noise in classrooms can only exacerbate their\ndifficulty in comprehending and processing verbal communication with other children and\ninstructions from the teacher.\nC\nChildren with auditory function deficit are potentially failing to learn to their\nmaximum potential because of noise levels generated in classrooms. The effects of noise\non the ability of children to learn effectively in typical classroom environments are now the\nsubject of increasing concern. The International Institute of Noise Control Engineering (I-\nINCE), on the advice of the World Health Organization, has established an\ninternational working party, which includes New Zealand, to evaluate noise and\nreverberation control for school rooms.\nD\nWhile the detrimental effects of noise in classroom situations are not limited to children\nexperiencing disability, those with a disability that affects their processing of speech\nand verbal communication could be extremely vulnerable. The auditory function deficits\nin question include hearing impairment, autistic spectrum disorders (ASD) and attention\ndeficit disorders (ADD/ADHD).\nE\nAutism is considered a neurological and genetic life-long disorder that causes\ndiscrepancies in the way information is processed. This disorder is characterised by\ninterlinking problems with social imagination, social communication and social interaction.\nAccording to Janzen, this affects the ability to understand and relate in typical ways to\npeople, understand events and objects in the environment, and understand or respond to\nsensory stimuli. Autism does not allow learning or thinking in the same ways as in children\n \n1\n\nwho are developing normally.\nAutistic spectrum disorders often result in major difficulties in comprehending verbal\ninformation and speech processing. Those experiencing these disorders often find\nsounds such as crowd noise and the noise generated by machinery painful and distressing.\nThis is difficult to scientifically quantify as such extra-sensory stimuli vary greatly from one\nautistic individual to another. But a child who finds any type of noise in their classroom or\nlearning space intrusive is likely to be adversely affected in their ability to process\ninformation.\nF\nThe attention deficit disorders are indicative of neurological and genetic disorders and are\ncharacterised by difficulties with sustaining attention, effort and persistence,\norganisation skills and disinhibition. Children experiencing these disorders find it difficult to\nscreen out unimportant information, and focus on everything in the environment rather than\nattending to a single activity. Background noise in the classroom becomes a major\ndistraction, which can affect their ability to concentrate.\nG\nChildren experiencing an auditory function deficit can often find speech and communication\nvery difficult to isolate and process when set against high levels of background noise.\nThese levels come from outside activities that penetrate the classroom structure, from\nteaching activities, and other noise generated inside, which can be exacerbated by\nroom reverberation. Strategies are needed to obtain the optimum classroom construction\nand perhaps a change in classroom culture and methods of teaching. In particular, the\neffects of noisy classrooms and activities on those experiencing disabilities in the form of\nauditory function deficit need thorough investigation. It is probable that many undiagnosed\nchildren exist in the education system with 'invisible' disabilities. Their needs are less likely\nto be met than those of children with known disabilities.\nH\nThe New Zealand Government has developed a New Zealand Disability Strategy and has\nembarked on a wide-ranging consultation process. The strategy recognises that\npeople experiencing disability face significant barriers in achieving a full quality of life in\nareas such as attitude, education, employment and access to services. Objective 3 of the\nNew Zealand Disability Strategy is to 'Provide the Best Education for Disabled People' by\nimproving education so that all children, youth learners and adult learners will have equal\nopportunities to learn and develop within their already existing local school. For a\nsuccessful education, the learning environment is vitally significant, so any effort to improve\nthis is likely to be of great benefit to all children, but especially to those with auditory\nfunction disabilities.\nI\nA number of countries are already in the process of formulating their own standards for the\ncontrol and reduction of classroom noise. New Zealand will probably follow their example.\nThe literature to date on noise in school rooms appears to focus on the effects\non schoolchildren in general, their teachers and the hearing impaired. Only limited\nattention appears to have been given to those students experiencing the other disabilities\n \n2\n\ninvolving auditory function deficit. It is imperative that the needs of these children are taken\ninto account in the setting of appropriate international standards to be promulgated in\nfuture.\n \n3",
