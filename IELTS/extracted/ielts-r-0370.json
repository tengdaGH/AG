Because identical twins\ncome from a single fertilized egg that splits into two, they share virtually the same\ngenetic code. Any differences between them -one twin having younger looking skin,\nfor example - must be due to environmental factors such as less time spent in the sun.\nAlternatively, by comparing the experiences of identical twins with those of fraternal twins,\nwho come from separate eggs and share on average half their DNA, researchers can\nquantify the extent to which our genes affect our lives. If identical twins are more similar to\neach other with respect to an ailment than fraternal twins are, then vulnerability to the\ndisease must be rooted at least in part in heredity.\nThese two lines of research - studying the differences between identical twins to pinpoint\nthe influence of environment, and comparing identical twins with fraternal ones to measure\nthe role of inheritance - have been crucial to understanding the interplay of nature\nand nurture in determining our personalities, behavior, and vulnerability to disease.\nThe idea of using twins to measure the influence of heredity dates back to 1875, when the\nEnglish scientist Francis Galton first suggested the approach (and coined the phrase\n'nature and nurture'). But twin studies took a surprising twist in the 1980s, with the arrival of\nstudies into identical twins who had been separated at birth and reunited as adults. Over\ntwo decades 137 sets of twins eventually visited Thomas Bouchard's lab in what became\nknown as the Minnesota Study of Twins Reared Apart. Numerous tests were carried out on\nthe twins, and they were each asked more than 15,000 questions.\nBouchard and his colleagues used this mountain of data to identify how far twins were\naffected by their genetic makeup. The key to their approach was a statistical concept called\nheritability. in broad terms, the heritability of a trait measures the extent to which\ndifferences among members of a population can be explained by differences in their\ngenetics. And wherever Bouchard and other scientists looked, it seemed, they found the\ninvisible hand of genetic influence helping to shape our lives.\nLately, however, twin studies have helped lead scientists to a radical new conclusion: that\nnature and nurture are not the only elemental forces at work. According to a recent field\ncalled epigenetics, there is a third factor also in play, one that in some cases serves as a\nbridge between the environment and our genes, and in others operates on its own to shape\nwho we are.\nEpigenetic processes are chemical reactions tied to neither nature nor nurture but\nrepresenting what researchers have called a 'third component'. These reactions influence\nhow our genetic code is expressed: how each gene is strengthened or weakened, even\nturned on or off, to build our bones, brains and all the other parts of our bodies.\nIf you think of our DNA as an immense piano keyboard and our genes as the keys - each\nkey symbolizing a segment of DNA responsible for a particular note, or trait, and all the\nkeys combining to make us who we are - then epigenetic processes determine when and\nhow each key can be struck, changing the tune being played.\nOne way the study of epigenetics is revolutionizing our understanding of biology is by\n \n1\n\nrevealing a mechanism by which the environment directly impacts on genes. Studies of\nanimals, for example, have shown that when a rat experiences stress during pregnancy, it\ncan cause epigenetic changes in a fetus that lead to behavioral problems as the rodent\ngrows up. Other epigenetic processes appear to occur randomly, while others are\nnormal, such as those that guide embryonic cells as they become heart, brain, or liver cells,\nfor example.\nGeneticist Danielle Reed has worked with many twins over the years and thought deeply\nabout what twin studies have taught us. 'It's very clear when you look at twins that much of\nwhat they share is hardwired,' she says. 'Many things about them are absolutely the same\nand unalterable. But it's also clear, when you get to know them, that other things\nabout them are different. Epigenetics is the origin of a lot of those differences, in my view.'\nReed credits Thomas Bouchard's work for today's surge in twin studies. 'He was\nthe trailblazer,' she says. 'We forget that 50 years ago things like heart disease\nwere thought to be caused entirely by lifestyle. Schizophrenia was thought to be due to\npoor mothering. Twin studies have allowed us to be more reflective about what people are\nactually born with and what's caused by experience.'\nHaving said that, Reed adds, the latest work in epigenetics promises to take\nour understanding even further. 'What I like to say is that nature writes some things\nin pencil and some things in pen,' she says. 'Things written in pen you can't change. That's\nDNA. But things written in pencil you can. That's epigenetics. Now that we're actually able\nto look at the DNA and see where the pencil writings are, it's sort of a whole new world.'\n \n2",
