  "passage_text": "Reading Practice\n \nRainwater Harvesting\n \nFor two years southern Sri Lanka suffered a prolonged drought, described by locals as “the\nworst in 50 years”. Some areas didn’t see a successful crop for four or five consecutive\nseasons. Livestock died, water in wells dropped to dangerously low levels, children were\nincreasingly malnourished and school attendance has fallen. An estimated 1.6 million\npeople were affected.\n \nA\n \n \nMuthukandiya is a village in Moneragala district, one of the drought-stricken areas in the\n“dry zone” of southern Sri Lanka, where half the country’s population of 18 million lives.\nRainfall in the area varies greatly from year to year, often bringing extreme dry spells in\nbetween monsoons. But this drought was much worse than usual. Despite some rain in\nNovember, only half of Moneragala’s 1,400 tube wells were in working order by March. The\ndrought devastated supplies of rice and freshwater fish, the staple diet of inland villages.\nMany local industries closed down and villagers headed for the towns in search of work.\n \nB\n \n \nThe villagers of muthukandiya arrived in the 1970s as part of a government resettlement\nscheme. Each family was given six acres of land, with no irrigation system. Because crop\nproduction, which relies entirely on rainfall, is insufficient to support most families, the\nvillage economy relies on men and women working as day-laborers in nearby sugar-cane\nplantations. Three wells have been dug to provide domestic water, but these run dry for\nmuch of the year. Women and children may spend several hours each day walking up to\nthree miles (five kilometers) to fetch water for drinking, washing, and cooking.\n \nC\n \n \nIn 1998, communities in the district discussed water problems with Practical Action South\nAsia. What followed was a drought mitigation initiative based on a low-cost “rainwater\nharvesting” technology already used in Sri Lanka and elsewhere in the region. It uses tanks\nto collect and store rain channeled by gutters and pipes as it runs off the roofs of houses.\n \nD\nDespite an indigenous tradition of rain-water harvesting and irrigation systems going back\nto the third century BC, policy-makers in modern times have often overlooked the value of\nsuch technologies, and it is only recently that officials have taken much interest in\nhousehold-level structures. Government and other programmes have, however, been top-\ndown in their conception and application, installing tanks free of charge without providing\n \n1\n\n \n \ntraining in the skills needed to build and maintain them properly. Practical Action South\nAsia’s project deliberately took a different approach, aiming to build up a local skills base\namong builders and users of the tanks, and to create structures and systems so that\ncommunities can manage their own rainwater harvesting schemes.\n \nE\n \nThe community of Muthukandiya was involved throughout. Two meetings were held where\nvillagers analysed their water problems, developed a mitigation plan and selected the\nrainwater harvesting technology. Two local masons received several days’ on-the-job\ntraining in building the 5,000-litre household storage tanks: surface tanks out of Ferro-\ncement and underground tanks out of brick. Each system, including tank, pipes, gutters\nand filters, cost US$195 – equivalent to a month’s income for an average village family.\nJust over half the cost was provided by the community, in the form of materials and\nunskilled labour. Practical Action South Asia contributed the rest, including cement,\ntransport and payment for the skilled labour. Households learned how to use and maintain\nthe tanks, and the whole community was trained to keep domestic water supplies clean. A\nvillage rainwater harvesting society was set up to run the project. To date, 37 families in\nand around Muthukandiya have storage tanks. Evaluations show clearly that households\nwith rainwater storage tanks have considerably more water for domestic needs than\nhouseholds relying entirely on wells and ponds. During the driest months, households with\ntanks may have up to twice as much water available. Their water is much cleaner, too.\n \nF\n \nNandawathie, a widow in the village, has taken full advantage of the opportunities that\nrainwater harvesting has brought her family. With a better water supply now close at hand,\nshe began by growing a few vegetables. The income from selling these helped her to open\na small shop on her doorstep. This increased her earnings still further, enabling her to\napply for a loan to install solar power in her house. She is now thinking of building another\ntank in her garden so that she can grow more vegetables. Nandawathie also feels safer\nnow that she no longer has to fetch water from the village well in the early morning or late\nevening. She says that her children no longer complain so much of diarrhoea. And her\ndaughter Sandamalee has more time for school work.\n \nG\n \nIn the short term, and on a small scale, the project has clearly been a success. The\nchallenge lies in making such initiatives sustainable and expanding their coverage. At a\npurely technical level, rainwater harvesting is evidently sustainable. In Muthukandiya, the\nskills required to build and maintain storage tanks were taught fairly easily and can be\nshared by the two trained masons, who are now finding work with other development\nagencies in the district.\n \nH\n \n2\n\n \nThe non-structural elements of the work, especially it’s financial and organizational, present\na bigger challenge. A revolving fund was set up, with households that had already\nbenefited agreeing to contribute a small monthly amount to pay for maintenance, repairs\nand new tanks. However, it appears that the revolving fund concept was not fully\nunderstood and it has proved difficult to get households to contribute. Recovering costs\nfrom interventions that do not generate income directly will always be a difficult proposition,\nalthough this can be overcome if the process is explained more fully at the outset.\n \nI\n \nThe Muthkandiya initiative was planned as a demonstration project, to show that\ncommunity-based drought mitigation through rainwater harvesting was feasible. Several\nother organizations have begun their own projects using the same approach. The feasibility\nof introducing larger tanks is being investigated.\n \nJ\nHowever, a lot of effort and patience are needed to generate the interest, develop the skills\nand organize the management structures needed to implement sustainable community-\nbased projects. It will probably be some time before rainwater harvesting technologies can\nspread rapidly and spontaneously across the district’s villages, without external support.\n \n3",
