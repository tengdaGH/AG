  "passage_text": "Reading Practice\n \nArchitecture - Reaching for the Sky\nArchitecture is the art and science of designing buildings and structures. A building reflects\nthe scientific and technological achievements of the age as well as the ideas and\naspirations of the designer and client. The appearance of individual buildings, however, is\noften controversial.\nThe use of an architectural style cannot be said to start or finish on a specific date. Neither\nis it possible to say exactly what characterises a particular movement. But the origins of\nwhat is now generally known as modern architecture can be traced back to the social and\ntechnological changes of the 18th and 19th centuries.\nInstead of using timber, stone and traditional building techniques, architects began to\nexplore ways of creating buildings by using the latest technology and materials such as\nsteel, glass and concrete strengthened steel bars, known as reinforced concrete.\nTechnological advances also helped bring about the decline of rural industries and an\nincrease in urban populations as people moved to the towns to work in the new factories.\nSuch rapid and uncontrolled growth helped to turn parts of cities into slums.\nBy the 1920s architects throughout Europe were reacting against the conditions created by\nindustrialisation. A new style of architecture emerged to reflect more idealistic notions for\nthe future. It was made possible by new materials and construction techniques and was\nknown as Modernism.\nBy the 1930s many buildings emerging from this movement were designed in the\nInternational Style. This was largely characterised by the bold use of new materials and\nsimple, geometric forms, often with white walls supported by stilt-like pillars. These were\nstripped of unnecessary decoration that would detract from their primary purpose — to be\nused or lived in.\nWalter Gropius, Charles Jeanneret (better known as Le Corbusier) and Ludwig Mies van\nder Rohe were among the most influential of the many architects who contributed to the\ndevelopment of Modernism in the first half of the century. But the economic depression of\nthe 1930s and the second world war (1939-45) prevented their ideas from being widely\nrealised until the economic conditions improved and war-torn cities had to be rebuilt. By the\n1950s, the International Style had developed into a universal approach to building, which\nstandardised the appearance of new buildings in cities across the world.\nUnfortunately, this Modernist interest in geometric simplicity and function became exploited\nfor profit. The rediscovery of quick-and-easy-to-handle reinforced concrete and an\nimproved ability to prefabricate building sections meant that builders could meet the\nbudgets of commissioning authorities and handle a renewed demand for development\nquickly and cheaply. But this led to many badly designed buildings, which discredited the\noriginal aims of Modernism.\nInfluenced by Le Corbusier’s ideas on town planning, every large British city built multi-\nstorey housing estates in the 1960s. Mass- produced, low-cost high-rises seemed to offer a\nsolution to the problem of housing a growing inner-city population. But far from meeting\nhuman needs, the new estates often proved to be windswept deserts lacking essential\nsocial facilities and services. Many of these buildings were poorly designed and\n \n1\n\nconstructed and have since been demolished.\nBy the 1970s, a new respect for the place of buildings within the existing townscape arose.\nPreserving historic buildings or keeping only their facades (or fronts) grew common.\nArchitects also began to make more use of building styles and materials that were\ntraditional to the area. The architectural style usually referred to as High Tech was also\nemerging. It celebrated scientific and engineering achievements by openly parading the\nsophisticated techniques used in construction. Such buildings are commonly made of metal\nand glass; examples are Stansted airport and the Lloyd’s building in London.\nDisillusionment at the failure of many of the poor imitations of Modernist architecture led to\ninterest in various styles and ideas from the past and present. By the 1980s the\ncoexistence of different styles of architecture in the same building became known as Post\nModern. Other architects looked back to the classical tradition. The trend in architecture\nnow favours smaller scale building design that reflects a growing public awareness of\nenvironmental issues such as energy efficiency. Like the Modernists, people today\nrecognise that a well designed environment improves the quality of life but is not\nnecessarily achieved by adopting one well defined style of architecture.\nTwentieth century architecture will mainly be remembered for its tall buildings. They have\nbeen made possible by the development of light steel frames and safe passenger lifts.\nThey originated in the US over a century ago to help meet the demand for more\neconomical use of land.
