  "passage_text": "Reading Practice\n \nPainters of time\n'The world's fascination with the mystique of Australian Aboriginal art.'\n \nEmmanuel de Roux\nA The works of Aboriginal artists are now much in demand throughout the world,\nand not just in Australia, where they are already fully recognised: the National\nMuseum of Australia, which opened in Canberra in 2001, designated 40% of its\nexhibition space to works by Aborigines. In Europe their art is being exhibited at a\nmuseum in Lyon. France, while the future Quai Branly museum in Paris\n      \n-\nwhich will be devoted to arts and civilisations of Africa. Asia, Oceania and the\nAmericas\n      \n-\n \nplans to commission frescoes by artists from Australia.\n \nB Their artistic movement began about 30 years ago. but its roots go back to time\nimmemorial. All the works refer to the founding myth of the Aboriginal culture, ‘the\nDreaming’. That internal geography, which is rendered with a brush and colours, is\nalso the expression of the Aborigines' long quest to regain the land which was\nstolen from them when Europeans arrived in the nineteenth century. ‘Painting is\nnothing without history.' says one such artist. Michael Nelson Tjakamarra.\n \nC There arc now fewer than 400.000 Aborigines living in Australia. They have been\nswamped by the country's 17.5 million immigrants. These original ‘natives' have\nbeen living in Australia for 50.000 years, but they were undoubtedly maltreated by\nthe newcomers. Driven back to the most barren lands or crammed into slums on the\noutskirts of cities, the Aborigines were subjected to a policy of ‘assimilation’, which\ninvolved kidnapping children to make them better ‘integrated' into European society,\nand herding the nomadic Aborigines by force into settled communities.\nD It was in one such community, Papunya, near Alice Springs, in the central desert,\nthat Aboriginal painting first came into its own. In 1971, a white schoolteacher.\nGeoffrey Bardon, suggested to a group of Aborigines that they should decorate the\nschool walls with ritual motifs. so as to pass on to the younger generation the myths\nthat were starting to fade from their collective memory, lie gave them brushes.\n \ncolours and surfaces to paint on cardboard and canvases. He was astounded by the result.\nBut their art did not come like a bolt from the blue: for thousands of years Aborigines had\nbeen ‘painting' on the ground using sands of different colours, and on rock faces. They had\nalso been decorating their bodies for ceremonial purposes. So there existed a formal\nvocabulary.\nE This had already been noted by Europeans. In the early twentieth century.\nAboriginal communities brought together by missionaries in northern Australia had\nbeen encouraged to reproduce on tree bark the motifs found on rock faces. Artists\nturned out a steady stream of works, supported by the churches, which helped to\nsell them to the public, and between 1950 and I960 Aboriginal paintings began to\nreach overseas museums. Painting on bark persisted in the north, whereas the\n \n1\n\n \ncommunities in the central desert increasingly used acrylic paint, and elsewhere in\nWestern Australia women explored the possibilities of wax painting and dyeing\nprocesses, known as ‘batik’.\nF What Aborigines depict are always elements of the Dreaming, the collective history\nthat each community is both part of and guardian of. I he Dreaming is the story of\ntheir origins, of their ‘Great Ancestors’, who passed on their knowledge, their art and\ntheir skills (hunting, medicine, painting, music and dance) to man. ‘The Dreaming is\nnot synonymous with the moment when the world was created.’ says Stephane\nJacob, one of the organisers of the Lyon exhibition. ‘For Aborigines, that moment\nhas never ceased to exist. It is perpetuated by the cycle of the seasons and the\nreligious ceremonies which the Aborigines organise. Indeed the aim of those\nceremonies is also to ensure the permanence of that golden age. The central\nfunction of Aboriginal painting, even in its contemporary manifestations, is to\nguarantee the survival of this world. The Dreaming is both past, present and future.'\nG Each work is created individually, with a form peculiar to each artist, but it is\ncreated within and on behalf of a community who must approve it. An artist cannot\nuse a 'dream' that does not belong to his or her community, since each community\nis the owner of its dreams, just as it is anchored to a territory marked out by its\nancestors, so each painting can be interpreted as a kind of spiritual road map for\nthat community.\nH Nowadays, each community is organised as a cooperative and draws on the\nservices of an art adviser, a government-employed agent who provides the artists\nwith materials, deals with galleries and museums and redistributes the proceeds\nfrom sales among the artists.\nToday, Aboriginal painting has become a great success. Some works sell for more than\n$25,000, and exceptional items may fetch as much as $180,000 in Australia.\n \n'By exporting their paintings as though they were surfaces of their territory, by\naccompanying them to the temples of western art. the Aborigines have redrawn the map of\ntheir country, into whose depths they were exiled,* says Yves Le Fur. of the Quai Branlv\nmuseum. ‘Masterpieces have been created. Their undeniable power prompts a dialogue\nthat has proved all too rare in the history of contacts between the two cultures’.\n \n2",
