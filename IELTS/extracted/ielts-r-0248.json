  "passage_text": "Reading Practice\n \nLast man standing\nSome 50,000 years ago, Homo sapiens beat other hominids to become the only\n \n \nsurviving species. Kate Ravilious reveals how we did it.\n \nA Today, there are over seven billion people living on Earth. No other species has exerted\nas much influence over the planet as us. But turn the clock back 80,000 years and we were\none of a number of species roaming the Earth. Our own species. Homo sapiens (Latin for\n’wise man'), was most successful in Africa. In western Eurasia, the Neanderthals\ndominated, while Homo erectus may have lived in Indonesia. Meanwhile, an unusual finger\nbone and tooth, discovered in Denisova cave in Siberia in 2008, have led scientists to\nbelieve that yet another human population - the Denisovans - may also have been\nwidespread across Asia. Somewhere along the line, these other human species died out,\nleaving Homo sapiens as the sole survivor. So what made us the winners in the battle for\nsurvival?\n \nB Some 74.000 years ago, the Toba ‘supervolcano' on the Indonesian island of Sumatra\nerupted. The scale of the event was so great that ash from the eruption was flung as far as\neastern India, more than 2,000 kilometres away. Oxford archaeologist Mike Petraglia and\nhis team have uncovered thousands of stone tools buried underneath the Toba ash. The\nmix of hand axes and spear tips have led Petraglia to speculate that Homo sapiens and\nHomo erectus were both living in eastern India prior to the Toba eruption. Based on careful\nexamination of the tools and dating of the sediment layers where they were found.\nPetraglia and his team suggest that Homo sapiens arrived in eastern India around 78.000\nyears ago. migrating out of Africa and across Arabia during a favourable climate period.\nAfter their arrival, the simple tools belonging to Homo erectus seemed to lessen in number\nand eventually disappear completely. 'We think that Homo sapiens had a more efficient\nhunting technology, which could have given them the edge.' says Petraglia. 'Whether the\neruption of Toba also played a role in the extinction of the Homo erectus-like species is\nunclear to us.'\nC Some 45.000 years later, another fight for survival took place. This time, the location was\nEurope and the protagonists were another species, the Neanderthals.\n \nThey were a highly successful species that dominated the European landscape for 300.000\nyears. Yet within just a few thousand years of the arrival of Homo sapiens, their numbers\nplummeted. They eventually disappeared from the landscape around 30.000 years ago.\nwith their last known refuge being southern Iberia, including Gibraltar. Initially. Homo\nsapiens and Neanderthals lived alongside each other and had no reason to compete. But\nthen Europe’s climate swung into a cold, inhospitable, dry phase. ‘Neanderthal and Homo\nsapiens populations had to retreat to refugia (pockets of habitable land). This heightened\ncompetition between the two groups,’ explains Chris Stringer, anthropologist at the Natural\nHistory Museum in London.\nD Both species were strong and stockier than the average human today, but Neanderthals\nwere particularly robust. ‘Their skeletons show that they had broad shoulders and thick\nnecks,' says Stringer. ‘Homo sapiens, on the other hand, had longer forearms, which\nundoubtedly enabled them to throw a spear from some distance, with less danger and\nusing relatively little energy,’ explains Stringer. This long-range ability may have given\nHomo sapiens an advantage in hunting. When it came to keeping warm. Homo sapiens\n \n1\n\n \nhad another skill: weaving and sewing. Archaeologists have uncovered simple needles\nfashioned from ivory and bone alongside Homo sapiens, dating as far back as 35,000\nyears ago. ‘Using this technology, we could use animal skins to make ourselves tents,\nwarm clothes and fur boots,’ says Stringer. In contrast. Neanderthals never seemed to\nmaster sewing skills, instead relying on pinning skins together with thorns.\n \nE A thirst for exploration provided Homo sapiens with another significant advantage over\nNeanderthals. Objects such as shell beads and flint tools, discovered many miles from their\nsource, show that our ancestors travelled over large distances, in order to barter and\nexchange useful materials, and share ideas and knowledge. By contrast. Neanderthals\ntended to keep themselves to themselves, living in small groups. They misdirected their\nenergies by only gathering resources from their immediate surroundings and perhaps\nfailing to discover new technologies outside their territory.\nF Some of these differences in behaviour may have emerged because the two species\nthought in different ways. By comparing skull shapes, archaeologists have shown that\nHomo sapiens had a more developed temporal lobe - the regions at the side of the brain,\nassociated with listening, language and long-term memory. 'We think that Homo sapiens\nhad a significantly more complex language than Neanderthals and were able to\ncomprehend and discuss concepts such as the distant past and future.' says Stringer.\nPenny Spikins, an archaeologist at the University of York, has recently suggested that\nHomo sapiens may also have had a greater diversity of brain types than Neanderthals.\n \n‘Our research indicates that high-precision tools, new hunting technologies and the\ndevelopment of symbolic communication may all have come about because they were\nwilling to include people with \"different\" minds and specialised roles in their society,’ she\nexplains. 'We see similar kinds of injuries on male and female Neanderthal skeletons,\nimplying there was no such division of labour,' says Spikins. \nG Thus by around 30,000 years ago. many talents and traits were well established in Homo\nsapiens societies but still absent from Neanderthal communities. Stringer thinks that the\nNeanderthals were just living in the wrong place at the wrong time. 'They had to compete\nwith Homo sapiens during a phase of very unstable climate across Europe. During each\nrapid climate fluctuation, they may have suffered greater losses of people than Homo\nsapiens, and thus were slowly worn down,’ he says. ‘If the climate had remained stable\nthroughout, they might still be here.’\n \n2",
