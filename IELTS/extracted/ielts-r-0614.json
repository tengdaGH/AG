  "passage_text": "Reading Practice\n \nWe have Star performers!\nA\nThe difference between companies is people. With capital and technology in plentiful\nsupply, the critical resource for companies in the knowledge era will be human talent.\nCompanies full of achievers will, by definition, outperform organisations of plodders. Ergo,\ncompete ferociously for the best people. Poach and pamper stars; ruthlessly weed out\nsecond-raters. This, in essence, has been the recruitment strategy of the ambitious\ncompany of the past decade. The ‘talent mindset’ was given definitive form in two reports\nby the consultancy McKinsey famously entitled The War for Talent. Although the intensity\nof the warfare subsequently subsided along with the air in the internet bubble, it has been\nwarming up again as the economy tightens: labour shortages, for example, are the reason\nthe government has laid out the welcome mat for immigrants from the new Europe.\nB\nYet while the diagnosis – people are important – is evident to the point of platitude, the\napparently logical prescription – hire the best – like so much in management is not only not\nobvious: it is in fact profoundly wrong. The first suspicions dawned with the crash to earth\nof the dotcom meteors, which showed that dumb is dumb whatever the IQ of those who\nperpetrate it. The point was illuminated in brilliant relief by Enron, whose leaders, as a New\nYorker article called ‘The Talent Myth’ entertainingly related, were so convinced of their\nown cleverness that they never twigged that collective intelligence is not the sum of a lot of\nindividual intelligence. In fact, in a profound sense, the two are opposites. Enron believed in\nstars, noted author Malcolm Gladwell, because they didn’t believe in systems. But\ncompanies don’t just create: ‘they execute and compete and coordinate the efforts of many\npeople, and the organisations that are most successful at that task are the ones where the\nsystem is the star’. The truth is that you can’t win the talent wars by hiring stars – only lose\nit. New light on why this should be so is thrown by an analysis of star behaviour in this\nmonths’ Harvard Business Review. In a study of the careers of 1,000 star-stock analysts in\nthe 1990s, the researchers found that when a company recruited a star performer, three\nthings happened.\nC\nFirst, stardom doesn’t easily transfer from one organisation to another. In many cases,\nperformance dropped sharply when high performers switched employers and in some\ninstances never recovered. More of success than commonly supposed is due to the\nworking environment – systems, processes, leadership, accumulated embedded learning\nthat are absent in and can’t be transported to the new firm. Moreover, precisely because of\ntheir past stellar performance, stars were unwilling to learn new tricks and antagonised\nthose (on whom they now unwittingly depended) who could teach them. So they moved,\nupping their salary as they did – 36 per cent moved on within three years, fast even for\nWall Street. Second, group performance suffered as a result of tensions and resentment by\nrivals within the team. One respondent likened hiring a star to an organ transplant. The new\norgan can damage others by hogging the blood supply, other organs can start aching or\nthreaten to stop working or the body can reject the transplants altogether, he said. ‘You\nshould think about it very carefully before you do a transplant to a healthy body.’ Third,\ninvestors punished the offender by selling its stock. This is ironic since the motive for\n \n1\n\nimporting stars was often a suffering share price in the first place. Shareholders evidently\nbelieve that the company is overpaying, the hiree is cashing in on a glorious past rather\nthan preparing for a glowing present, and a spending spree is in the offing.\nD\nThe result of mass star hirings as well as individual ones seems to confirm such doubts.\nLook at County NatWest and Barclays de Zoete Wedd, both of which hired teams of stars\nwith loud fanfare to do great things in investment banking in the 1990s. Both failed\ndismally. Everyone accepts the cliche that people make the organisation – but much more\ndoes the organisation make the people. When researchers studied the performance of fund\nmanagers in the 1990s, they discovered that just 30 per cent of the variation in fund\nperformance was due to the individual, compared to 70 per cent to the company-specific\nsetting.\nE\nThat will be no surprise to those familiar with systems thinking. W Edwards Deming used to\nsay that there was no point in beating up on people when 90 per cent of performance\nvariation was down to the system within which they worked. Consistent improvement, he\nsaid, is a matter not of raising the level of individual intelligence, but of the learning of the\norganisation as a whole. The star system is glamorous – for the few. But it rarely benefits\nthe company that thinks it is working it. And the knock-on consequences indirectly affect\neveryone else too. As one internet response to Gladwell’s New Yorker article put it: after\nEnron, ‘the rest of corporate America is stuck with overpaid, arrogant, underachieving, and\nrelatively useless talent.’\nF\nFootball is another illustration of the star vs systems strategic choice. As with investment\nbanks and stockbrokers, it seems obvious that success should ultimately be down to\nmoney. Great players are scarce and expensive. So the club that can afford more of them\nthan anyone else will win. But the performance of Arsenal and Manchester United on one\nhand and Chelsea and Real Madrid on the other proves that it’s not as easy as that. While\nChelsea and Real have the funds to be compulsive star collectors – as with Juan Sebastian\nVeron – they are less successful than Arsenal and United which, like Liverpool before\nthem, have put much more emphasis on developing a setting within which stars-in-the-\nmaking can flourish. Significantly, Thierry Henry, Patrick Veira and Robert Pires are much\nbigger stars than when Arsenal bought them, their value (in all senses) enhanced by the\nArsenal system. At Chelsea, by contrast, the only context is the stars themselves –\nmanagers with different outlooks come and go every couple of seasons. There is no settled\nsystem for the stars to blend into. The Chelsea context has not only not added value, but it\nhas also subtracted it. The side is less than the sum of its exorbitantly expensive parts.\nEven Real Madrid’s galacticos, the most extravagantly gifted on the planet, are being\noutperformed by less talented but better-integrated Spanish sides. In football, too, stars are\ntrumped by systems.\nG\nSo if not by hiring stars, how do you compete in the war for talent? You grow your own.\nThis worked for investment analysts, where some companies were not only better at\ncreating stars but also at retaining them. Because they had a much more sophisticated\n \n2\n\nview of the interdependent relationship between star and system, they kept them longer\nwithout resorting to the exorbitant salaries that were so destructive to rivals.\n \n3",
