  "passage_text": "Reading Practice\n \nBrunel: ‘The Practical Prophet’\n \nA\nIn the frontispiece of his book on Brunel, Peter Hay quotes from Nicholson’s British\nEncyclopaedia of 1909 as follows: ‘Engineers are extremely necessary for these purposes;\nwherefore it is requisite that, besides being ingenious, they should be brave in proportion.’\nHis father, Sir Marc Isambard Brunel (1769-1849), was himself a famous engineer, of\nFrench parents. He eventually settled in Britain and married the Sophia Kingdom, an\nEnglish woman whom he had known in France in earlier days. Their only son Isambard\nwas born on 9 April 1806. He was sent to France at the age of 14 to study mathematics\nand science and was 16 when he returned to England to work with his father. Sir Marc was\nthen building his famous tunnel under the River Thames. Isambard was recuperating near\nBristol from injuries received in a tunnel cave-in when he became involved with his own first\nmajor project.\n–The Suspension Bridge ion the Avon Gorge\nB\nThe span of Brunel’s bridge was over 700ft, longer than any existing when it was designed,\nand the height above water about 245ft. The technical challenges of this engineering\nproject were immense, and Brunel dealt with them with his usual, thoroughness and\ningenuity. Two design competitions were held, and the great bridge designer Thomas\nTelford was the committee’s expert. Brunel presented four designs. He went beyond\ntechnicalities to include arguments based on, among other things, the grace of his tower\ndesign. Unfortunately, he only got so far as to put up the end piers in his lifetime. The\nClifton Suspension Bridge was completed in his honor by his engineering friends in1864\nand is still in use.\nThe Great Western Railway\nC\nWhile Brunel was still in Bristol, and with the Avon Bridge project stopped or going slowly,\nhe became aware that the civic authorities saw the need for a railway link to London.\nRailway location was controversial since private landowners and towns had to be dealt\nwith. Mainly, the landed gentry did not want a messy, noisy railway anywhere near them.\nThe Duke of Wellington (of Waterloo fame) was certainly against it. Again Brunel showed\ngreat skill in presenting his arguments to the various committees and individuals. BruneI\nbuilt his railway with a broad gauge (7ft) instead of the standard 4ft 8½in, which had been\nused for lines already installed. There is no doubt that the broad gauge gave superior ride\nand stability, but it was fighting a standard.\nAtmospheric railway:\nD\nBrunel’s ready acceptance of new ideas overpowered good engineering judgment (at least\nin hindsight) when he advocated the installation of an atmospheric railway in South Devon.\n \n1\n\nIt had the great attraction of doing away with the locomotive and potentially could deal with\nsteeper gradients. Since this connecting arm had to run along the slit, it had to be opened\nthrough a flap as the train progressed, but closed airtight behind it. Materials were not up to\nit, and this arrangement was troublesome and expensive to keep in repair. After a year of\nfrustration, the system was abandoned. Brunel admitted his failure and took responsibility.\nHe also took no fee for his work, setting a good professional example.\nBrunel’s ships:\nE  \nThe idea of using steam to power ships to cross the ocean appealed to Brunel. When his\nGWR company directors complained about the great length of their railway (it was only\nabout 100 miles), Isambard jokingly suggested that they could even make it longer—why\nnot go all the way to New York and call the link the Great Western. The “Great Western”\nwas the first steamship to engage in transatlantic service. Brunel formed the Great Western\nSteamship Company and construction started on the ship in Bristol in 1836. Built of wood\nand 236ft long, the Great Western was launched in 1837 and powered by sail and\npaddlewheels. The first trip to New York took just 15 days, and 14 days to return. This was\na great success, a one way trip under sail would take more than a month. The Great\nWestern was the firsts steamship to engage in transatlantic service and made 74 crossings\nto New York.\nF\nHaving done so well with the Great Western, Brunel immediately got to work on an even\nbigger ship. Great Britain was made of iron and also built-in Bristol, 322ft in length. The\ninitial design was for the ship to be driven by paddle wheels, but Brunel had seen one of\nthe first propeller-driven ships to arrive in Britain, and he abandoned his plans for\npaddlewheel propulsion. The ship was launched in 1843 and was the first screw-driven iron\nship to cross the Atlantic. Great Britain ran aground early in its career but was repaired,\nsold, and sailed for years to Australia, and other parts of the world, setting the standard for\nocean travel. In the early 1970s, the old ship was rescued from the Falklands and is now\nunder restoration in Bristol.\nG\nConventional wisdom in Brunel’s day was that steamships could not carry enough coal to\nmake long ocean voyages. But he correctly figured out that this was a case where size\nmattered. He set out to design the biggest ship ever, five times larger than any ship built up\nto that time. Big enough to carry fuel to get to Australia without refueling, in addition, it\nwould carry 4,000 passengers.\nThe Great Eastern was 692ft long, with a displacement of about 32,000 tons. Construction\nbegan in 1854 on the Thames at Millwall. Brunel had chosen John Scott Russell to build\nthe ship. He was a well-established engineer and naval architect, but the contract did not\ngo well. Among other things, Scott Russell was very low in his estimates and money was\nsoon a problem. Construction came to a standstill in 1856 and Brunel himself had to take\nover the work. But Brunel was nothing if not determined and by September 1859, after a\ndelayed and problem -ridden  launch,  the Great Eastern was ready for the maiden voyage,\nBrunei was too sick to go, but it was just as well because only a few hours out there was an\nexplosion in the engine room which would have destroyed a lesser ship. Brunel died within\n \n2\n\na week or so of the accident. The great ship never carried 4,000 passengers (among other\nthings, the Suez Canal came along) and although it made several transatlantic crossings, it\nwas not a financial success. Shortly after the Great Eastern began working life, the\nAmerican entrepreneur Cyrus Field and his backers were looking for a ship big enough to\ncarry 5,000 tons of telegraphic cable, which was to be laid on the ocean floor from Ireland\nto Newfoundland. Although Brunel did not have it in mind, the Great Eastern was an\nexcellent vessel for this work on July 27, 1866. It successfully completed the connection\nand a hundred years of transatlantic communication by cable began. The ship continued\nthis career for several years, used for laying cables in many parts of the world.\n \n3",
