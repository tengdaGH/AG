  "passage_text": "Reading Practice\n \nSegway into the Future\nWill the electric vehicle known as the Segway alter the ways that individuals get around?\nDean Kamer, the inventor of the Segway, believes that this revolutionary vehicle will\nsomeday substitute for the bicycles and automobiles that now crowd our cities. When he\nintroduced the Segway in 2001, he believed it would change our lives.\nAlthough the Segway uses up-to-the-minute technology, it looks very ordinary. The metal\nframework of the Segway consists of a platform where an individual stands. Attached to the\nfront of the platform is a tall post with handles for the driver to hold. On each side of the\nplatform is a wide, rubber wheel. Except for these two wheels, there are no mechanical\nparts on the Segway. It has no engine, no brakes, no pedal power, no gears, and no\nsteering wheel.\nInstead it uses a computer system that imitates the ability of humans to keep their balance.\nThis system seems to move to the driver’s thoughts. For example, when the driver thinks\n“Go forward’’, the Segway moves forwards, and when the driver thinks, “Stop’’, it stops.\nThe Segway is not really responding to the driver’s thoughts, but to the tiny changes in\nbalance that the driver makes as he prepares his body to move forward or to stop. For\nexample, when the driver thinks about moving forward, he actually leans slightly forward,\nand when he thinks of stopping or slowing, the driver leans slightly back.\nThe Segway is powered by batteries that allow it to travel about T7miles on one battery\ncharge. It is designed for short-range, low-speed operation. It has three speed settings.\nThe slowest is the setting for learning, with speeds of up to 6 miles per hour. Next is the\nsidewalk setting, with speeds of up to 9 miles , per hour. The highest setting allows the\ndriver to travel up to 12.5 miles per hour in open, flat areas.\nAt all three speed settings, the Segway can go wherever a person can walk, both indoors\nand outdoors.\nWorkers who must walk a lot in their jobs might be the primary users of Segways. For\nexample, police officers could drive Segways to patrol city streets, and mail carriers could\ndrive from house to house to deliver letters and packages. Farmers could quickly inspect\ndistant fields and bams, and rangers, or parks. Security guards could protect\nneighborhoods or large buildings.\nAny task requiring a lot of walking could be made easier. In cities, shoppers could leave\ntheir cars at home and ride Segway from store to store. Also, people who cannot\ncomfortably walk due to age, illness, or injury could minimize their walking but still be able\nto go many places on a Segway.\nWhy is it, then, that our job sites, parks, and shopping centers have not been subsequently\nfilled with Segways since they were introduced in 2001? Why hasn’t the expected\nrevolution taken place? Studies have shown that Segways can help workers get more done\nin a shorter time. This saves money. Engineers admire Segways as a technological\nmarvel. \nBusiness, government agencies, and individuals, however, have been unwilling to accept\nthe Segway. Yes, there have been some successes. In a few cities, for example, mail\n \n1\n\ncarriers drive Segway on their routes, and police officers patrol on Segways. San\nFrancisco, California, and Florence, Italy, are among several cities in the world that offer\ntours on Segways for a small fee. Occasionally you will see golfers riding Segways around\ngolf courses. Throughout the world more than 150 security agencies use Segways, and\nChina has recently entered the overseas market. These examples are encouraging,\nbut can hardly be called a revolution.\nThe primary reason seems to be that people have an inherent fear of doing something\nnew. They fear others will laugh at them for buying a “toy’’. They fear losing control of the\nvehicle. They fear being injured. They fear not knowing the rules for using a Segway. They\nfear making people angry if they ride on the sidewalk. All these fears and others have kept\nsales low.\nThe inventor explained why people have been slow to accept the Segway. He said, \"We\ndidn’t realize that although technology moves very quickly, people’s mind-set changes very\nslowly.” Perhaps a hundred years from now millions of people around the world will be\nriding Segways.\n \n2",
