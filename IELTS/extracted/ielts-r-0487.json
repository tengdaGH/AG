  "passage_text": "Reading Practice\n \nThe history of cakes at weddings\n \nIn Western cultures, since antiquity. Weddings customarily have been celebrated with a\nspecial cake. Ancient Roman wedding ceremonies were finalized by breaking a cake of\nwheat or barley over the bride’s head as n symbol of good fortune. The newly married\ncouple then ate some of the crumbs together. Afterward, the wedding guests gathered up\nthe remaining crumbs as tokens of good luck. Wedding guests were also supplied with\nsweetmeats called confetti, a sweet mixture of nuts, dried fruit and honeyed almonds.\nHandfuls of confetti were showered over the bride and groom; indeed, it seems to have\nbeen the custom to throw confetti about enthusiastically. Eventually, confetti in the form of\nsweets and nuts was replaced with rice, flower petals, or colored paper, and these new\ntypes of confetti continue to be thrown over newly married couples in many countries\naround the world.\n \nWhen the Romans invaded Britain in 43 AD, many of their customs and traditions became\npart of British life. These customs included their wedding customs, and when the Normans\ninvaded Britain in 1066 they brought many French traditions. Other changes came about\ndue to increased trade and contact with Europe, but present-day British wedding traditions\nremain firmly rooted in the past. In medieval Britain, small spiced buns, which were\ncommon everyday fare, were often eaten at weddings. These were stacked in a towering\npile, as high as possible. If the bride and groom were able to kiss over the tall stack, it\naugured a lifetime of riches. The earliest British recipe exclusively for eating at weddings is\nBride Pie, which was recorded in 1685. This was a large round pie with an elaborately\ndecorated pastry crust that concealed a filling of oysters, pine nuts lamb and spices. Each\nguest had to eat a small piece of the pier not to do so was considered extremely impolite. A\nring was traditionally placed in the pie, and the lady who found it would be next to marry.\n \nIn the 17th century, Bride Pie was changed into Bride Cake, the predecessor of the modern\nBritish wedding cake. Cakes containing dried fruit and sugar, symbols of prosperity,\ngradually became the centerpieces for weddings. Some people made Bride Cake in the\ncheaper form of two large rounds of pastry sandwiched together with currants and\nsprinkled with sugar. Very few homes at the time could boast of having ovens, but this type\nof pastry cake could be cooked on a baking stone on the hearth.\n \nLater in the 17th century, there was a new development when wedding cakes began to be\nmade in pairs, one for the bride and another for the groom. Both cakes were dark, heavy\nfruitcakes; the groom’s cake was smaller than the bride’s cake, and was cut up into little\nsquares that were placed in boxes for the guests to take home as a wedding memento.\nGroom’s cakes gradually died out and are no longer part of British weddings. However, the\ntradition has undergone a revival in the United States, where for many years the groom’s\ncake has served as a wedding gift for guests. Modern groom’s cakes are often formed and\ndecorated to depict the groom’s hobby, for example a golf bag, a camera, a chess board.\n \n1\n\n \nGroom’s cakes were never covered with icing, but Bride Cake covered with white icing first\nappeared sometime in the 17th century. After the cake was baked, it was covered with a\npure white, smooth icing made with double refined sugar, egg whites, and orange-flower\nwater. The mixture was beaten for two hours, then spread over the cake and dried in the\noven until hard. A pure white color was much sought after for wedding cake icing because\nwhite icing meant that only the finest refined sugar had been used. Thus a pure white cake\nwas a status symbol, as it displayed the family’s wealth.\n \nThe late 1800s in Britain saw the introduction of a new tradition, with the first multi-tiered\nwedding cakes. These were impressive cakes: they were heavy because they were made\nwith so much dried fruit, and highly decorated with icing and embellished with sugar\nflowers, doves, horseshoes and bells. The first multi-tiered cakes comprised iced cakes\nstacked on top of each other rather like a succession of boxes gradually decreasing in size.\nThe cakes from the upper tiers did not sink into the lower tiers because they were a bit put\non top of each other until the icing between each cake had had time to harden.
