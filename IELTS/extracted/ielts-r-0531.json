  "passage_text": "Reading Practice\n \nThe Pompidou Centre\nMore than three decades after it was built, the Pompidou Centre in Paris has survived its\nmoment at the edge of architectural fashion and proved itself to be one of the most\nremarkable buildings of the 20th century.\nIt was the most outstanding now building constructed in Paris for two generations. It looked\nlike an explosion of brightly coloured service pipes in the calm of the city centre. However,\nwhen in 1977 the architects Richard Rogers and Renzo Piano stood among a large crowd\nof 5,000 at the opening of the Centre Culturel d'Art Georges Pompidou (known as the\nPompidou), no one was really aware of the significance of this unusual building.\nRogers was only 38 when he and Piano won the competition to design a new cultural\ncentre for Paris in the old market site. Young, unknown architects, they had been chosen\nfrom a field of nearly 700 to design one of the most prestigious buildings of its day. After six\ndifficult years, with 25,000 drawings, seven lawsuits, battles over budgets, and a desperate\nlast-minute scramble to finish the building, it had finally been done.\nYet the opening was a downbeat moment. The Pompidou Centre had been rubbished by\nthe critics while it was being built, there was no more work in prospect for the architects,\nand their partnership had effectively broken down. But this was just a passing crisis. The\nCentre, which combined the national museum of modern art, exhibition space, a public\nlibrary and a centre for modern music, proved an enormous success. It attracted six million\nvisitors in its first year, and with its success, the critics swiftly changed their tune.\nThe architects had been driven by the desire for ultimate flexibility, for a building that would\nnot limit the movement of its users. All the different parts were approached through the\nsame enormous entrance hall and served by the same escalator, which was free to anyone\nto ride, whether they wanted to visit an exhibition or just admire the view. With all the\nservices at one end of the building, escalators and lifts at the other, and the floors hung on\ngiant steel beams providing uninterrupted space the size of two football pitches, their\ndream had become a reality.\nThe image of the Pompidou pervaded popular culture in the 1970s, making appearances\neverywhere - on record-album covers and a table lamp, and even acting as the set for a\nJames Bond 1 film. This did much to overcome the secretive nature of the architectural\nculture of its time, as it enabled wider audience to appreciate the style and content of the\nbuilding and so moved away from the strictly professional view.\nThe following year, Rogers was commissioned to design a new headquarters for Lloyd's\nBank in London and went on to create one of Britain's most dynamic architectural\npractices. Piano is now among the world's most respected architects. But what of their\nshared creation?\nIt was certainly like no previous museum, with its plans for a flexible interior that not only\nhad movable walls but floors that could also be adjusted up or down. This second feature\ndid not in the end survive when the competition drawings were turned into a real building.\nIn other ways, however, the finished building demonstrated a remarkable degree of\nrefinement - of craftsmanship even - in the way the original diagram was transformed into a\nsuperbly detailed structure. It was this quality which, according to some critics, suggested\n \n1\n\nthat the Pompidou should be seen as closer to the 19th-century engineering tradition than\nthe space age.\nNevertheless, as a model for urban planning, it has proved immensely influential. The\nGuggenheim in Bilbao* and the many other major landmark projects that were built in the\nbelief that innovatively designed cultural buildings can bring about urban renewal are all\nfollowing the lead of the Pompidou Centre.\nOther buildings may now challenge it for the title of Europe s most outlandish work of\narchitecture. However, more than a quarter of a century later, this construction - it is hard to\ncall it a building when there is no façade, just a lattice of steel beams and pipes and a long\nexternal escalator snaking up the outside - still seems extreme.\n \nToday, the Pompidou Centre itself still looks much as it did when it opened. The shock\nvalue of its colour-coded plumbing and its structure has not faded with the years. But while\ntraditionalists regarded it as an ugly attack on Paris when it was built, they now see it for\nwhat it is - an enormous achievement, technically and conceptually.\n \n2",
