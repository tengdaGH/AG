  "passage_text": "Reading Practice\n \nLight pollution\n{A} If humans were truly at home under the light of the moon and stars, we would go into\ndarkness happily, the midnight world as visible to us as it is to the vast number of nocturnal\nspecies on this planet. Instead, we are diurnal creatures, with eyes adapted to living in the\nsun’s light. This is a basic evolutionary fact, even though most of us don’t think of ourselves\nas diurnal beings any more than we think of ourselves as primates or mammals, or\nEarthlings. Yet it’s the only way to explain what we’ve done to the night: We’ve engineered\nit to receive us by filling it with light.\n \n{B} This kind of engineering is no different than damming a river. Its benefits come with\nconsequences—called light pollution—whose effects scientists are only now beginning to\nstudy. Light pollution is largely the result of bad lighting design, which allows artificial light\nto shine outward and upward into the sky, where it’s not wanted, instead of focusing it\ndownward, where it is. Ill-designed lighting washes out the darkness of night and radically\nalters the light levels and light rhythms—to which many forms of life, including ourselves,\nhave adapted.\n{C} Now most of humanity lives under intersecting domes of reflected, refracted light, of\nscattering rays from overlit cities and suburbs, from light-flooded highways and factories.\nNearly all of nighttime Europe is a nebula of light, as is most of the United States and all of\nJapan. In the south Atlantic the glow from a single fishing fleet squid fishermen during their\nprey with metal halide lamps—can be seen from space, burning brighter, in fact, than\nBuenos Aires or Rio de Janeiro.\n{D} We’ve lit up the night as if it were an unoccupied country when nothing could be further\nfrom the truth. Among mammals alone, the number of nocturnal species is astonishing.\nLight is a powerful biological force, and in many species, it acts as a magnet, a process\nbeing studied by researchers such as Travis Longcore and Catherine Rich, co-founders of\nthe Los Angeles-based Urban Wildlands Group. The effect is so powerful that scientists\nspeak of songbirds and seabirds being “captured” by searchlights on land or by the light\nfrom gas flares on marine oil platforms, circling and circling in the thousands until they\ndrop. Migrating at night, birds are apt to collide with brightly lit tall buildings; immature birds\non their first journey suffer disproportionately.\n \n{E} Insects, of course, cluster around streetlights, and feeding at those insect clusters is\nnow ingrained in the lives of many bat species. In some Swiss valleys, the European lesser\nhorseshoe bat began to vanish after streetlights were installed, perhaps because those\nvalleys were suddenly filled with light-feeding pipistrelle bats. Other nocturnal\nmammals—including desert rodents, fruit bats, opossums, and badgers-forage more\ncautiously under the permanent full moon of light pollution because they’ve become easier\ntargets for predators.\n{F} Some birds—blackbirds and nightingales, among others—sing at unnatural hours in the\npresence of artificial light. Scientists have determined that long artificial days— and\nartificially short nights induce early breeding in a wide range of birds. And because a longer\nday allows for longer feeding, it can also affect migration schedules. One population of\n \n1\n\nBewick’s swans wintering in England put on fat more rapidly than usual, priming them to\nbegin their Siberian migration early. The problem, of course, is that migration, like most\nother aspects of bird behaviour, is a precisely timed biological behaviour. Leaving early\nmay mean arriving too soon for nesting conditions to be right\n{G} Nesting sea turtles, which show a natural predisposition for dark beaches, find fewer\nand fewer of them to nest on. Their hatchlings, which gravitate toward the brighter, more\nreflective sea horizon, find themselves confused by artificial lighting behind the beach. In\nFlorida alone, hatchling losses number in the hundreds of thousands every year. Frogs and\ntoads living near brightly lit highways suffer nocturnal light levels that are as much as a\nmillion times brighter than normal, throwing nearly every aspect of their behaviour out of\njoint, including their nighttime breeding choruses.\n \n{H} Of all the pollution we face, light pollution is perhaps the most easily remedied. Simple\nchanges in lighting design and installation yield immediate changes in the amount of light\nspilt into the atmosphere and, often, immediate energy savings.\n{I} It was once thought that light pollution only affected astronomers, who need to see the\nnight sky in all its glorious clarity. And, in fact, some of the earliest civic efforts to control\nlight pollution—in Flagstaff, Arizona, half a century ago—were made to protect the view\nfrom Lowell Observatory, which sits high above that city. Flagstaff has tightened its\nregulations since then, and in 2001 it was declared the first International Dark Sky City. By\nnow the effort to control light pollution has spread around the globe. More and more cities\nand even entire countries, such as the Czech Republic, have committed themselves to\nreducing unwanted glare.\n{J} Unlike astronomers, most of us may not need an undiminished view of the night sky for\nour work, but like most other creatures we do need darkness. Darkness is as essential to\nour biological welfare, to our internal clockwork, as light itself.
