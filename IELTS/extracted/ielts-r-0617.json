  "passage_text": "Reading Practice\n \nWhat are you laughing at?\nA\nWe like to think that laughing is the height of human sophistication. Our big brains let us\nsee the humour in a strategically positioned pun, an unexpected plot twist or a clever piece\nof wordplay. But while joking and wit are uniquely human inventions, laughter certainly is\nnot. Other creatures, including chimpanzees, gorillas and even rats, chuckle. Obviously,\nthey don’t crack up at Homer Simpson or titter at the boss’s dreadful jokes, but the fact that\nthey laugh in the first place suggests that sniggers and chortles have been around for a lot\nlonger than we have. It points the way to the origins of laughter, suggesting a much more\npractical purpose than you might think.\nB\nThere is no doubt that laughing typical involves groups of people. ‘Laughter evolved as a\nsignal to others – it almost disappears when we are alone,’ says Robert Provine, a\nneuroscientist at the University of Maryland. Provine found that most laughter comes as a\npolite reaction to everyday remarks such as ‘see you later’, rather than anything particularly\nfunny. And the way we laugh depends on the company we’re keeping. Men tend to laugh\nlonger and harder when they are with other men, perhaps as a way of bonding. Women\ntend to laugh more and at a higher pitch when men are present, possibly indicating flirtation\nor even submission.\nC\nTo find the origins of laughter, Provine believes we need to look at the play. He points out\nthat the masters of laughing are children, and nowhere is their talent more obvious than in\nthe boisterous antics, and the original context plays,’ he says. Well-known primate\nwatchers, including Dian Fossey and Jane Goodall, have long argued that chimps laugh\nwhile at play. The sound they produce is known as a panting laugh. It seems obvious when\nyou watch their behavior – they even have the same ticklish spots as we do. But remove\nthe context, and the parallel between human laughter and a chimp’s characteristic pant\nlaugh is not so clear. When Provine played a tape of the pant laughs to 119 of his students,\nfor example, only two guessed correctly what it was.\nD\nThese findings underline how chimp and human laughter vary. When we laugh the sound is\nusually produced by chopping up a single exhalation into a series of shorter with one sound\nproduced on each inward and outward breath. The question is: does this pant laughter\nhave the same source as our own laughter? New research lends weight to the idea that it\ndoes. The findings come from Elke Zimmerman, head of the Institute for Zoology in\nGermany, who compared the sounds made by babies and chimpanzees in response to\ntickling during the first year of their life. Using sound spectrographs to reveal the pitch and\nintensity of vocalizations, she discovered that chimp and human baby laughter follow\nbroadly the same pattern. Zimmerman believes the closeness of baby laughter to chimp\nlaughter supports the idea that laughter was around long before humans arrived on the\nscene. What started simply as a modification of breathing associated with enjoyable and\nplayful interactions has acquired a symbolic meaning as an indicator of pleasure.\n \n1\n\nE\nPinpointing when laughter developed is another matter. Humans and chimps share a\ncommon ancestor that lived perhaps 8 million years ago, but animals might have been\nlaughing long before that. More distantly related primates, including gorillas, laugh, and\nanecdotal evidence suggests that other social mammals nay do too. Scientists are\ncurrently testing such stories with a comparative analysis of just how common laughter is\namong animals. So far, though, the most compelling evidence for laughter beyond primates\ncomes from research done by Jaak Panksepp from Bowling Green State University, Ohio,\ninto the ultrasonic chirps produced by rats during play and in response to tickling.\nF\nAll this still doesn’t answer the question of why we laugh at all. One idea is that laughter\nand tickling originated as a way of sealing the relationship between mother and child.\nAnother is that the reflex response to tickling is protective, alerting us to the presence of\ncrawling creatures that might harm us or compelling us to defend the parts of our bodies\nthat are most vulnerable in hand-to-hand combat. But the idea that has gained most\npopularity in recent years is that laughter in response to tickling is a way for two individuals\nto signal and test their trust in one another. This hypothesis starts from the observation that\nalthough a little tickle can be enjoyable if it goes on too long it can be torture. By engaging\nin a bout of tickling, we put ourselves at the mercy of another individual, and laughing is a\nsignal that we laughter is what makes it a reliable signal of trust according to Tom Flamson,\na laughter researcher at the University of California, Los Angels. ‘Even in rats, laughter,\ntickle, play and trust are linked. Rats chirp a lot when they play,’ says Flamson. ‘These\nchirps can be aroused by tickling. And they get bonded to us as a result, which certainly\nseems like a show of trust.’\nG\nWe’ll never know which animal laughed the first laugh, or why. But we can be sure it wasn’t\nin response to a prehistoric joke. The funny thing is that while the origins of laughter are\nprobably quite serious, we owe human laughter and our language-based humor to the\nsame unique skill. While other animals pant, we alone can control our breath well enough\nto produce the sound of laughter. Without that control, there would also be no speech –\nand no jokes to endure.\n \n2",
