  "passage_text": "Reading Practice\n \nThe role of accidents in business\nIn 1894 Dr John Kellogg and his brother. Will, were supervising a hospital and health spa in\nMichigan. The patients were on a restricted diet. One day, the brothers left cooked wheat\nuntended for more than 24 hours. When they returned, they saw what they had done. It\nwas no good to eat, but they decided to run the stale wheat through rollers, just to see how\nit would turn out. Normally, the process produced long sheets, but they were surprised to\ndiscover that this time the rollers created flat flakes. They baked them, and then tried the\nsame thing with corn. From this accidental discovery came the cornflakes that generations\nhave now been eating for breakfast.\nAccidents happen; there is nothing predictable and orderly about innovation. Nobel\nlaureate Sir Alan Hodgkin, who discovered how nerve cells transmit electrical impulses\nbetween the skin and the brain, commented: 'I believe that the record of my published\npapers conveys an impression of directedness and planning which does not at all coincide\nwith the actual sequence of events.’\nThe same rule applies in business. The mistake that gave US cornflakes keeps repeating\nitself in the history of disruptive innovation, the kind that transforms markets. Louis\nDaguerre, for, instance, discovered the technique that gave US photography in the 1830s,\nwhen drops of mercury from a shattered thermometer produced a photographic image. The\nmicrowave was discovered when Peroy Spender, a scientist with Raytheon, was testing a\nnew vacuum tube and discovered that the sweet in his pocket had melted. The artificial\nsweetener, saccharin, was the unintentional result of a medical scientist’s work on a\nchemical treatment for gastric ulcers. While working for the firm 3M, researcher Art Fry had\nno idea he was taking the first steps towards Post- It Notes when he used bits of adhesive\noffice paper that could be easily lifted off the page to replace the scrap paper bookmarks\nthat kept falling out of his hymn book.\n \n \nBreakthrough and disruptive innovation are rarely driven by orderly process. Usually they\ncome out of a chaotic, haphazard mess, which is why big companies, full of managers\nschooled in business programmes designed to eliminate random variation and mistakes,\nstruggle with them. In these sorts of environments, accidents are called failures and are\ndiscouraged.\n \n \nIt is no surprise then that research from the late British economist Paul Geroski and London\nBusiness School’s Constantinos Markides found that companies that were skilled at\ninnovation were usually not that skilled when it came to commercialisation, and vice versa.\nTheir book, Fast Second, divides businesses into 'colonists’ and 'consolidators’. Small and\nnimble, colonists are adept at creating market niches but are terrible institution builders.\nConsolidators, with their strong cultures of discipline and cost control, know how to take\nclever ideas from other firms and turn them into massmarket items. Microsoft is a prime\ninstance of this.\nWith companies spending hundreds of billions of dollars on research and development, US\nacademics Robert Austin and Lee Devin examined how managers can encourage\nproductive slip-ups. In their article Accident, Intention and Expectation in the Innovation\nProcess, they argue that business processes actually prevent helpful mis-steps from\noccurring. According to their catalogue of accidents, not all false steps and mishaps are\nequal. Accidents, they say, come from unlikely mental associations such as memories and\n \n1\n\nvague connections, looking for something and finding it in an unexpected way, looking for\none thing and finding something else, and not looking for anything but finding something\nvaluable.\nAccident-prone innovation, they say, requires companies to get outside the ‘cone of\nexpectation’. It means throwing together groups from diverse backgrounds, and combining\nideas in unpredictable ways, other strategies also include having systems that watch out for\naccidents and examine them for value, generating them when they do not happen often\nenough, seizing oil the useful ones, capturing their valuable features, and building on them\nto add value and give potential for useful accidents.\nAll this, however, requires thinking that is often counter-intuitive to the way businesses\noperate. In other words, it is the kind of thinking that goes against the beliefs of most\nbusiness managers. It runs counter to the notion frequently pushes by consultants that you\ncan ‘harness’ creativity and direct it to line up with intention. ‘The cost of accidents\nbusiness, people tend to call such efforts failure.’\nThere are tentative signs that more companies are starting to realise that failure can lead to\ncommercial gain, and that this is part or the risk-talking that underpins innovation.\nAustralia’s largest brewing company, for example, made a bad error when it launched a\nnew beer called Empire Lager, pitched at younger consumers. Having spent a fortune\ncreating a beer with a sweeter taste, designing a great-looking bottle and a television\ncampaign, Foster’s was left with a drink that no-one wanted to buy. The target market was\nmore interested in brands built up by word of mouth.\nInstead of wiping the unsuccessfull product launch, Fosters used this lesson learned to go\non and develop other brands instead. One of them, Pure Blonde, is now ranked as\nAustralia’s fifth-largest beer brand. Unlike Empire Lager, there has been almost no\npromotion and its sales are generated more by word of mouth.\nOther companies are taking similar steps to study their own slip-ups. Intuit, the company\nbehind financial tools such as Quicken, holds regular ‘When Learning Hurts’ sessions. But\nthis sort of transformation is never easy.
