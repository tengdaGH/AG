  "passage_text": "Reading Practice\n \nDecision, Decision !\nResearch explores when we can make a vital decision quickly and we need to proceed\nmore deliberately\nA\nA widely recognised legend tells us that in Gordium (in what is now Turkey) in the fourth\ncentury BC an oxcart was roped to a pole with a complex knot. It was said that the first\nperson to untie it would become the king of Asia. Unfortunately, the knot proved impossible\nto untie. The story continues that when confronted with this problem, rather than\ndeliberating on how to untie the Gordian knot. Alexander, the famous ruler of the Greeks in\nthe ancient world, simply took out his sword and cut it in two – then went on to conquer\nAsia. Ever since the notion of a ‘Gordian solution’ has referred to the attractiveness of a\nsimple answer to an otherwise intractable problem.\nB\nAmong researchers in the psychology of decision making, however, such solutions have\ntraditionally held little appeal. In particular, the ‘conflict model’ of decision making proposed\nby psychologists Irving Janis and Leon Mann in their 1977 book, Decision Making, argued\nthat a complex decision-making process is essential for guarding individuals and groups\nfrom the peril of ‘group-think’. Decisions made without thorough canvassing, surveying,\nweighing, examining and reexamining relevant information and options would be\nsuboptimal and often disastrous. One foreign affair decision made by a well-known US\npolitical leader in the 1960s is typically held us as an example of the perils of inadequate\nthought, whereas his successful handling of a water crisis is cited as an example of the\nadvantages of careful deliberation. However, examination of these historical events by\nPeter Suedfield, a psychologist at the University of British Columbia, and Roderick Kramer,\na psychologist at the Stanford Graduate School of Business, found little difference in the\ntwo decision-making processes; both crises required and received complex consideration\nby the political administration, but later only the second one was deemed to be the\neffective.\nC\nIn general, however, organizational and political science offers little evidence that complex\ndecisions fare better than simpler ones. In fact, a growing body of work suggests that in\nmany situations simply ‘snap’ decisions with being routinely superior to more complex ones\n– an idea that gained widespread public appeal with Malcolm Gladwell’s best-selling book\nBlink (2005).\nD\nAn article by Ap Dijksterhuis of the University of Amsterdam and his colleagues, Making the\nRight Choice: the Deliberation-without-attention Effect’, runs very much in the spirit of\nGladwell’s influential text. Its core argument is that to be effective, conscious (deliberative)\ndecision making requires cognitive resources. Because increasingly complex decisions\nplace increasing strain on those resources, the quality of our decisions declines as their\ncomplexity increases. In short, complex decisions overrun our cognitive powers. On the\nother hand, unconscious decision making (what the author refer to as ‘deliberation without\n \n1\n\nattention’) requires no cognitive resources, so task complexity does not Effectiveness. The\nseemingly counterintuitive conclusion is that although conscious thought enhances simple\ndecisions, the opposite holds true for more complex decisions.\nE\nDijksterhuis reports four Simple but elegant studies supporting this argument. In one,\nparticipants assessed the quality of four hypothetical cars by considering either four\nattributes (a simple task) or 12 attributes (a complex task). Among participants who\nconsidered four attributes, those who were allowed to engage in undistracted deliberative\nthought did better at discriminating between the best and worst cars. Those who were\ndistracted and thus unable to deliberate had to rely on their unconscious thinking and did\nless well. The opposite pattern emerged when people considered 12 criteria. In this case,\nconscious deliberation led to inferior discrimination and poor decisions.\nF\nIn other studies, Dijksterhuis surveyed people shopping for clothes (‘simple’ products) and\nfurniture (‘complex’ products). Compared with those who said they had deliberated long\nand hard, shoppers who bought with little conscious deliberation felt less happy with their\nsimple clothing purchase but happier with the complex furniture purchases. Deliberation\nwithout attention actually produced better results as the decisions became more complex.\nG\nFrom there, however, the researchers take a big leap. They write: There is no reason to\nassume that the deliberation-without-attention effect does not generalize to other types of\nchoices – political, managerial or otherwise. In such cases, it should benefit the individual\nto think consciously about simple matters and to delegate thinking about more complicated\nmatters to the unconscious.\nH\nThis radical inference contradicts standard political and managerial theory but doubtless\ncomforts those in politics and management who always find the simple solution to the\ncomplex problem an attractive proposition. Indeed, one suspects many of our political\nleaders already embrace this wisdom.\nI\nStill, it is there, in the realms of society and its governance, that the more problematic\nimplications of deliberation without attention begin to surface. Variables that can be neatly\ncircumscribed in decisions about shopping lose clarity in a world of group dynamics, social\ninteraction, history and politics. Two pertinent questions arise. First, what counts as a\ncomplex decision? And second, what counts as a good outcome?\nJ\nAs social psychologist Kurt Lewin (1890 – 1947) noted, a ‘good’ decision that nobody\nrespects is actually bad, his classic studies of decision making showed that participating in\ndeliberative processes makes people more likely to abide by the results. The issue here is\nthat when political decision-makers make mistakes, it is their politics, or the relationship\nbetween their politics and our own, rather than psychology which is at fault.\n \n2\n\nK\nGladwell’s book and Dijksterhuis’s paper are invaluable in pointing out the limitations of the\nconventional wisdom that decision quality rises with decision-making complexity. But this\nwork still tempts us to believe that decision making is simply a matter of psychology, rather\nthan also a question of politics, ideology and group membership. Avoiding social\nconsiderations in a search for general appeal rather than toward it.\n \n3",
