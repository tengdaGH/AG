  "passage_text": "Reading Practice\n \nTHE STORY OF COFFEE\nA\n \nCoffee was first discovered in Eastern Africa in an area we know today as Ethiopia. A\npopular legend refers to a goat herder by the name of Kaldi, who observed his goats acting\nunusually friskily after eating berries from a bush. Curious about this phenomenon, Kaldi\ntried eating the berries himself. He found that these berries gave him renewed energy.\nB\n \nThe news of this energy laden fruit quickly moved throughout the region. Coffee berries\nwere transported from Ethiopia to the Arabian Peninsula, and were first cultivated in what\ntoday is the country of Yemen. Coffee remained a secret in Arabia before spreading to\nTurkey and then to the European continent by means of Venetian trade merchants.\nC\n \nCoffee was first eaten as a food though later people in Arabia would make a drink out of\nboiling the beans for its narcotic effects and medicinal value. Coffee for a time was known\nas Arabian wine to Muslims who were banned from alcohol by Islam. It was not until after\ncoffee had been eaten as a food product, a wine and a medicine that it was discovered,\nprobably by complete accident in Turkey, that by roasting the beans a delicious drink could\nbe made. The roasted beans were first crushed and then boiled in water, creating a crude\nversion of the beverage we enjoy today. The first coffee houses were opened in Europe in\nthe 17th Century and in 1675, the Viennese established the habit of refining the brew by\nfiltering out the grounds, sweetening it, and adding a dash of milk.\nD\n \nIf you were to explore the planet for coffee, you would find about 60 species of coffee\nplants growing wild in Africa, Malaysia, and other regions. But only about ten of them are\nactually cultivated. Of these ten, two species are responsible for almost all the coffee\nproduced in the world: Coffea Arabica and Coffea Canephora (usually known as Robusta).\nBecause of ecological differences existing among the various coffee producing countries,\nboth types have undergone many mutations and now exist in many sub-species.\nE\nAlthough wild plants can reach 10 - 12 metres in height, the plantation one reaches a\nheight of around four metres. This makes the harvest and flowering easier, and cultivation\nmore economical. The flowers are white and sweet-scented like the Spanish jasmine.\nFlowers give way to a red, darkish berry. At first sight, the fruit is like a big cherry both in\nsize and in colour. The berry is coated with a thin, red film (epicarp) containing a white,\n \n1\n\n \nsugary mucilaginous flesh (mesocarp). Inside the pulp there are the seeds in the form of\ntwo beans coupled at their flat surface. Beans are in turn coated with a kind of resistant,\ngolden yellow parchment, (called endocarp). When peeled, the real bean appears with\nanother very thin silvery film. The bean is bluish green verging on bronze, and is at the\nmost 11 millimetres long and 8 millimetres wide.\nF\n \nCoffee plants need special conditions to give a satisfactory crop. The climate needs to be\nhot-wet or hot temperate, between the Tropic of Cancer and the Tropic of Capricorn, with\nfrequent rains and temperatures varying from 15 to 25 Degrees C. The soil should be deep,\nhard, permeable, well irrigated, with well-drained subsoil. The best lands are the hilly ones\nor from just-tilled woods. The perfect altitude is between 600 and 1200 metres, though\nsome varieties thrive at 2000-2200 metres. Cultivation aimed at protecting the plants at\nevery stage of growth is needed. Sowing should be in sheltered nurseries from which, after\nabout six months, the seedlings should be moved to plantations in the rainy season where\nthey are usually alternated with other plants to shield them from wind and excessive\nsunlight. Only when the plant is five years old can it be counted upon to give a regular\nyield. This is between 400 grams and two kilos of arabica beans for each plant, and 600\ngrams and two kilos for robusta beans.\nG\nHarvesting time depends on the geographic situation and it can vary greatly therefore\naccording to the various producing countries. First, the ripe beans are picked from the\nbranches. Pickers can selectively pick approximately 250 to 300 pounds of coffee cherry a\nday. At the end of the day, the pickers bring their heavy burlap bags to pulping mills where\nthe cherry coffee can be pulped (or wet milled). The pulped beans then rest, covered in\npure rainwater to ferment overnight. The next day the wet beans are hand-distributed upon\nthe drying floor to be sun dried. This drying process takes from one to two weeks\ndepending on the amount of sunny days available. To make sure they dry evenly, the\nbeans need to be raked many times during this drying time. Two weeks later the sun dried\nbeans, now called parchment, are scooped up, bagged and taken to be milled. Huge\nmilling machines then remove the parchment and silver skin, which renders a green bean\nsuitable for roasting. The green beans are roasted according to the customers’\nspecifications and, after cooling, the beans are then packaged and mailed to customers.\n \n2",
