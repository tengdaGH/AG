  "passage_text": "Reading Practice\n \nDisappearing Delta\nA\nThe fertile land of the Nile delta is being eroded along Egypt's Mediterranean coast at an\nastounding rate, in some parts estimated at 100 metres per year. In the past, land scoured\naway from the coastline by the currents of the Mediterranean Sea used to be replaced by\nsediment brought down to the delta by the River Mile, but this is no longer happening.\nB\nUp to now, people have blamed this loss of delta land on the two large dams at Aswan in\nthe south of Egypt, which hold back virtually all of the sediment that used to flow down the\nriver. Before the dams were built, the Nile flowed freely, carrying huge quantities of\nsediment north from Africa's interior to be deposited on the Nile delta. This continued for\n7,000 years, eventually covering a region of over 22,000 square kilometres with layers of\nfertile silt. Annual flooding brought in new, nutrient-rich soil to the delta region, replacing\nwhat had been washed away by the sea, and dispensing with the need for fertilizers in\nEgypt's richest food-growing area But when the Aswan dams were constructed in the 20th\ncentury to provide electricity and irrigation, and to protect the huge population centre of\nCairo and its surrounding areas from annual flooding and drought, most of the sediment\nwith its natural fertilizer accumulated up above the dam in the southern, upstream half of\nLake Nasser, instead of passing down to the delta.\nC\nNow, however, there turns out to be more to the story It appears that the sediment-free\nwater emerging from the Aswan dams picks up silt and land as it erodes the river bed and\nbanks on the 800-kilometre trip to Cairo. Daniel Jean Stanley of the Smithsonian Institute\nnoticed that water samples taken in Cairo, just before the river enters the delta, indicated\nthat the river sometimes carries more than 850 grams of sediment per cubic metre of water\n- almost half of what it carried before the dams were built.\n'I'm ashamed to say that the significance of this didn't strike me until after I had read 50 or\n60 studies,' says Stanley in Marine Geology. 'There is still a lot of sediment coming into the\ndelta, but virtually no sediment comes out into the Mediterranean to replenish the coastline.\nSo this sediment must be trapped on the delta itself.'\nD\nOnce north of Cairo, most of the Nile water is diverted into more than 10,000 kilometres of\nirrigation canals and only o small proportion reaches the sea directly through the rivers in\nthe delta. The water in the irrigation canals is still or very slow-moving and thus cannot\ncarry sediment, Stanley explains. The sediment sinks to the bottom of the canals and then\nis added to fields by farmers or pumped with the water into the four large freshwater\nlagoons that are located near the outer edges of the delta. So very little of it actually\nreaches the coastline to replace what is being washed away by the Mediterranean\ncurrents.\nE\n \n1\n\n \nThe farms on the delta plains and fishing and aquaculture in the lagoons account for much\nof Egypt's food supply. But by the lime the sediment has come to rest in the fields and\nlagoons it is laden with municipal, industrial and agricultural waste from the Cairo region,\nwhich is home to more than 40 million people. 'Pollutants are building up faster and faster,'\nsays Stanley.\nBased on his investigations of sediment from the delta lagoons, Frederic Siegel of George\nWashington University concurs. 'In Manzalah Lagoon, for example, the increase in\nmercury, lead, copper and zinc coincided with the building of the High Dam at Aswan, the\navailability of cheap electricity, and the development of major power-based industries/ he\nsays. Since that time the concentration of mercury has increased significantly. Lead from\nengines that use leaded fuels and from other industrial sources has also increased\ndramatically. These poisons can easily enter the food chain, affecting the productivity of\nfishing and farming. Another problem is that agricultural wastes include fertilizers which\nstimulate increases in plant growth in the lagoons and upset the ecology of the area, with\nserious effects on the fishing industry.\nF\n \nAccording to Siegel, international environmental organisations are beginning to pay closer\nattention to the region, partly because of the problems of erosion and pollution of the Nile\ndelta, but principally because they fear the impact this situation could have on the whole\nMediterranean coastal ecosystem. But there are no easy solutions. In the immediate future,\nStanley believes that one solution would be to make artificial floods to flush out the delta\nwaterways, in the same way that natural floods did before the construction of the dams. He\nsays, however, that in the long term an alternative process such as desalination may have\nto be used to increase the amount of water available. 'In my view, Egypt must devise a way\nto have more water running through the river and the delta/ says Stanley. Easier said than\ndone in a desert region with a rapidly growing population.\n \n2",
