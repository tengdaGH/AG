  "passage_text": "Reading Practice\n \nChildren Tested to Destruction?\nEnglish primary school pupils subjected to more tests than in any other country\nEnglish primary school pupils have to deal with unprecedented levels of pressure as they\nface tests more frequently, at a younger age, and in more subjects than children from any\nother country, according to one of the biggest international education inquiries in decades.\nThe damning indictment of England’s primary education system revealed that the country’s\nchildren are now the most tested in the world. From their very earliest days at school they\nmust navigate a set-up whose trademark is’high stakes’testing, according to a recent report\nParents are encouraged to choose schools for their children based on league tables of test\nscores. But this puts children under extreme pressure which could damage their motivation\nand self-esteem, as well as encouraging schools to’teach to the test’at the expense of\npupils’wider learning, the study found. The findings are part of a two-year inquiry – led by\nCambridge University – into English primary schools. Other parts of the UK and countries\nsuch as France, Norway and Japan used testing but it was,’less intrusive, less\ncomprehensive, and considerably less frequent’, Cambridge’s Primary Review concluded.\nEngland was unique in using testing to control what is taught in schools, to monitor\nteaching standards and to encourage parents to choose schools based on the results of\nthe tests, according to Kathy Flail, from the National University of Ireland in Cork, and\nKamil Ozerk, from the University of Oslo, who conducted the research. ‘Assessment in\nEngland, compared to our other reviewed countries, is pervasive, highly consequential, and\ntaken by officialdom and the public more generally to portray objectively the actual quality\nof primary education in schools,’their report concluded. Teachers’leaders said the testing\nregime was ‘past its sell-by date’and called for a fundamental review of assessment.\nSteve Sinnott, General Secretary of the National Union of Teachers, said England’s testing\nsystem was having a’devastating’impact on schools.’Uniquely, England is a country where\ntesting is used to police schools and control what is taught,’ he said. ‘When it comes to\ntesting in England, the tail wags the dog. It is patently absurd that even the structure and\ncontent of education is shaped by the demands of the tests. I call on the Government to\ninitiate a full and independent review of the impact of the current testing system on schools\nand on children’s learning and to be prepared to dismantle a system which is long past its\nsell-by date.’\nJohn Dunford, General Secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders,\nwarned that the tests were having a damaging effect on pupils. The whole testing regime is\ngoverned by the need to produce league tables,’ he said. ‘It has more to do with holding\nschools to account than helping pupils to progress.’\nThe fear that many children were suffering intolerable stress because of the tests was\nvoiced by Mick Brookes, General Secretary of the National Association of Head Teachers.\nThere are schools that start rehearsing for key stage two SATs [Standard Assessment\nTests] from the moment the children arrive in September. That’s just utterly ridiculous,’he\nsaid. There are other schools that rehearse SATs during Christmas week.These are young\nchildren we are talking about They should be having the time of their lives at school not just\nworrying about tests. It is the breadth and richness of the curriculum that suffers. The\nconsequences for schools not reaching their targets are dire – heads can lose their jobs\n \n1\n\nand schools can be closed down. With this at stake it’s not surprising that schools let the\ntests take over’.\nDavid Laws, the Liberal Democrat schools spokesman, said:The uniquely high stakes\nplaced on national tests mean that many primary schools have become too exam focused.’\nHowever, the Government rejected the criticism. The idea that children are over-tested is\nnot a view that the Government accepts,’a spokesman said. The reality is that children\nspend a very small percentage of their time in school being tested. Seeing that children\nleave school up to the right standard in the basics is the highest priority of the\nGovernment.’\nIn another child-centred initiative, both major political parties in the UK – Labour and the\nConservatives – have announced plans to make Britain more child-friendly following a\nreport by UNICEF which ranked the UK the worst place to be a child out of 21 rich nations.\nParents were warned that they risked creating a generation of’battery-farmed children’ by\nalways keeping them indoors to ensure their safety. The family’s minister, Kevin Brennan,\ncalled for an end to the’cotton wool’culture and warned that children would not learn to\ncope with risks if they were never allowed to play outdoors.\n \n2",
