  "passage_text": "Reading Practice\n \nThe risks agriculture faces in developing countries\n \nSynthesis of an online debate \n \nA\nTwo things distinguish food production from all other productive activities: first, every single person needs food\neach day and has a right to it; and second, it is hugely dependent on nature. These two unique aspects, one\npolitical, the other natural, make food production highly vulnerable and different from any other business. At the\nsame time, cultural values are highly entrenched in food and agricultural systems worldwide.\n \nB\nFarmers everywhere face major risks; including extreme weather, long-term climate change, and price volatility\nin input and product markets. However, smallholder farmers in developing countries must in addition deal with\nadverse environments, both natural, in terms of soil quality, rainfall, etc. and human, in terms of infrastructure,\nfinancial systems, markets, knowledge and technology. Counter-intuitively, hunger is prevalent among many\nsmallholder farmers in the developing world.\nC\nParticipants in the online debate argued that our biggest challenge is to address the underlying causes of the\nagricultural system’s inability to ensure sufficient food for all, and they identified as drivers of this problem our\ndependency on fossil fuels and unsupportive government policies.\n \nD\nOn the question of mitigating the risks farmers face, most essayists called for greater state intervention.\nIn his essay, Kanayo F. Nwanze, President of the International Fund for Agricultural Development, argued that\ngovernments can significantly reduce risks for farmers by providing basic services like roads to get produce\nmore efficiently to markets, or water and food storage facilities to reduce losses. Sophia Murphy, senior advisor\nto the Institute for Agriculture and Trade Policy, suggested that the procurement and holding of stocks by\ngovernments can also help mitigate wild swings in food prices by alleviating uncertainties about market supply.\n \n \nE \nShenggen Fan, Director General of the International Food Policy Research Institute, held up social safety nets\nand public welfare programmes in Ethiopia, Brazil and Mexico as valuable ways to address poverty among\nfarming families and reduce their vulnerability to agriculture shocks. However, some commentators responded\nthat cash transfers to poor families do not necessarily translate into increased food security, as these\nprogrammes do not always strengthen food production or raise incomes.\n \nRegarding state subsidies for agriculture, Rokeya Kabir, Executive Director of Bangladesh Nari Progati Sangha,\ncommented in her essay that these ‘have not compensated for the stranglehold exercised by private traders.\nIn fact, studies show that sixty percent of beneficiaries of subsidies are not poor, but rich landowners and non-\nfarmer traders.\nF\nNwanze, Murphy and Fan argued that private risk management tools, like private insurance, commodity futures\nmarkets, and rural finance can help small-scale producers mitigate risk and allow for investment in\nimprovements. Kabir warned that financial support schemes often encourage the adoption of high-input\nagricultural practices, which in the medium term may raise production costs beyond the value of their harvests.\nMurphy noted that when futures markets become excessively financialised they can contribute to short-term\nprice volatility, which increases farmers’ food insecurity. Many participants and commentators emphasised that\ngreater transparency in markets is needed to mitigate the impact of volatility, and make evident whether\nadequate stocks and supplies are available. Others contended that agribusiness companies should be held\nresponsible for paying for negative side effects.\n \n1\n\n \nG \nMany essayists mentioned climate change and its consequences for small-scale agriculture. Fan explained that\nin addition to reducing crop yields, climate change increases the magnitude and the frequency of extreme\nweather events, which increase smallholder vulnerability. The growing unpredictability of weather patterns\nincreases farmers’ difficulty in managing weather-related risks.\nAccording to this author, one solution would be to develop crop varieties that are more resilient to new climate\ntrends and extreme weather patterns. Accordingly, Pat Mooney, co-founder and executive director of the ETC\nGroup, suggested that ‘if we are to survive climate change, we must adopt policies that let peasants diversify the\nplant and animal species and varieties/breeds that make up our menus.\nH\nSome participating authors and commentators argued in favour of community- based and autonomous risk\nmanagement strategies through collective action groups, co-operatives or producers’ groups. Such groups\nenhance market opportunities for small-scale producers, reduce marketing costs and synchronise buying and\nselling with seasonal price conditions.\n \nAccording to Murphy, ‘collective action offers an important way for farmers to strengthen their political and\neconomic bargaining power, and to reduce their business risks. One commentator, Giel Ton, warned that\ncollective action does not come as a free good. It takes time, effort and money to organise, build trust and to\nexperiment. Others, like Marcel Vernooij and Marcel Beukeboom, suggested that in order to ‘apply what we\nalready know’, all stakeholders, including business, government, scientists and civil society, must work together,\nstarting at the beginning of the value chain.\nI \nSome participants explained that market price volatility is often worsened by the presence of intermediary\npurchasers who, taking advantage of farmers’ vulnerability, dictate prices. One commentator suggested farmers\ncan gain greater control over prices and minimise price volatility by selling directly to consumers.\nSimilarly, Sonali Bisht, founder and advisor to the Institute of Himalayan Environmental Research and Education\n(INHERE), India, wrote that copipunity-supported agriculture, where consumers invest in local farmers by\nsubscription and guarantee producers a fair price, is a risk-sharing model worth more attention. Direct food\ndistribution systems not only encourage small-scale agriculture but also give consumers more control over the\nfood they consume, she wrote.\n \n2",
