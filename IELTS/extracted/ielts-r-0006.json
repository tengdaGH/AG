  "passage_text": "Reading Practice\n \nA decibel Hell (The Effects of Living in a Noisy World)\nSection A decibel Hell:\nIt’s not difficult for a person to encounter sound at levels that can cause adverse health\neffects. During a single day, people living in a typical urban environment can experience a\nwide range of sounds in many locations, even once-quiet locales have become polluted\nwith noise. In fact, it’s difficult today to escape sound completely. In its 1999 Guidelines for\nCommunity Noise, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared, “Worldwide, noise-\ninduced hearing impairment is the most prevalent irreversible occupational hazard, and it is\nestimated that 120 million people worldwide have disabling hearing difficulties.” Growing\nevidence also points to many other health effects of too much volume.\nMark Stephenson, a Cincinnati, Ohio-based senior research audiologist at the National\nInstitute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH), says his agency’s definition of\nhazardous noise is sound that exceeds the time-weighted average of 85 dBA, meaning the\naverage noise exposure measured over a typical eight-hour workday. Other measures and\ndefinitions are used for other purposes.\nSection B Growing Volume\nIn the United States, about 30 million workers are exposed to hazardous sound levels on\nthe job, according to NIOSH. Industries having a high number of workers exposed to loud\nsounds include construction, agriculture, mining, manufacturing, utilities, transportation,\nand the military.\nNoise in U.S. industry is an extremely difficult problem to monitor, acknowledges Craig\nMoulton, a senior industrial hygienist for the Occupational Safety and Health Administration\n(OSHA). “Still,” he says, “OSHA does require that any employer with workers overexposed\nto noise provide protection for those employees against the harmful effects of noise.\nAdditionally, employers must implement a continuing, effective hearing conservation\nprogram as outlined in OSHA’s Noise Standard.”\nSection C Scary Sound Effects\nNumerous scientific studies over the years have confirmed that exposure to certain levels\nof sound can damage hearing. Prolonged exposure can actually change the structure of\nthe hair cells in the inner ear, resulting in hearing loss. It can also cause tinnitus, a ringing,\nroaring, buzzing, or clicking on the ears.\n \nNIOSH studies from the mid to late 1990s show that 90% of coal miners have hearing\nimpairment by age 52 – compared to 9% of the general population – and 70% of male\nmetal/nonmetal miners will experience hearing impairment by age 60 (Stephenson notes\nthat from adolescence onward, females tend to have better hearing than males). Neitzel\nsays nearly half of all construction workers have some degree of hearing loss. “NIOSH\nresearch also reveals that by age twenty-five, the average carpenter’s hearing is equivalent\nto an otherwise healthy fifty-year-old male who hasn’t been exposed to noise,” he says.\nWilliam Luxford, medical director of the House Ear Clinic of St. Vincent Medical Center in\nLos Angeles, points out one piece of good news: “It’s true that continuous noise exposure\n \n1\n\nwill lead to the continuation of hearing loss, but as soon as the exposure is stopped, the\nhearing loss stops. So a change in environment can improve a person’s hearing health.”\nResearch is catching up with this anecdotal evidence. In the July 2001 issue of Pediatrics,\nresearchers from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported that, based on\naudiometric testing of 5,249 children as part of the Third National Health and Nutrition,\nExamination Survey, an estimated 12.5% of American children have noise-induced hearing\nthreshold shifts – or dulled hearing – in one or both ears. Most children with noise-induced\nhearing threshold shifts have only limited hearing damage, but continued exposure to\nexcessive noise can lead to difficulties with high-frequency sound discrimination. The report\nlisted stereos, music concerts, toys (such as toy telephones and certain rattles),\nlawnmowers, and fireworks as producing potentially harmful sounds.\nSection D Beyond the Ears\nThe effects of sound don’t stop with the ears. Nonauditory effects of noise exposure are\nthose effects that don’t cause hearing loss but still can be measured, such as elevated\nblood pressure, loss of sleep, increased heart rate, cardiovascular constriction, labored\nbreathing, and changes in brain chemistry.\n \nThe nonauditory effects of noise were noted as early as 1930 in a study published by E.L.\nSmith and D.L. Laird in volume 2 of the Journal of the Acoustical Society of America. The\nresults showed that exposure to noise caused stomach contractions in healthy human\nbeings. Reports on noise’s nonauditory effects published since that pioneering study have\nbeen both contradictory and controversial in some areas.\nBronzaft and the school principal persuaded the school board to have acoustical tile\ninstalled in the classrooms adjacent to the tracks. The Transit Authority also treated the\ntracks near the school to make them less noisy. A follow-up study published in the\nSeptember 1981 issue of the Journal of Environmental Psychology found that children’s\nreading scores improved after these interventions were put in place.\nSection E Fighting for Quiet\nAnti-noise activists say that Europe and several countries in Asia are more advanced than\nthe United States in terms of combating noise. “Population pressure has prompted Europe\nto move more quickly on the noise issue that the United States has,” Hume says. In the\nEuropean Union, countries with cities of at least 250,000 people are creating noise maps of\nthose cities to help leaders determine noise pollution policies. Paris has already prepared\nits first noise maps. The map data, which must be finished by 2007, will be fed into\ncomputer models that will help test the sound impact of street designs or new buildings\nbefore construction begins.\nActivists in other countries say they too want the United States to play a more leading role\non the noise issue. But as in other areas of environmental health, merely having a more\npowerful government agency in place that can set more regulations is not the ultimate\nanswer, according to other experts. Bronzaft stresses that governments worldwide need to\nincrease funding for noise research and do a better job coordinating their noise pollution\nefforts so they can establish health and environmental policies based on solid scientific\nresearch. “Governments have a responsibility to protect their citizens by curbing noise\npollution,” she says.\n \n2",
