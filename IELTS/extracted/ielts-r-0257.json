  "passage_text": "Reading Practice\n \nLife-Casting and Art\n \nJulian Bames explores the questions posed by Life-Casts, an exhibition of plaster\nmoulds of living people and objects which were originally used for scientific\npurposes\n \nA Art changes over time and our idea of what art is changes too. For example, objects\noriginally intended for devotional, ritualistic or re-creational purposes may be recategorised\nas art by members of other later civilisations, such as our own, which no longer respond to\nthese purposes.\n \nB What also happens is that techniques and crafts which would have been judged inartistic\nat the time they were used are reassessed. Life-casting is an interesting example of this. It\ninvolved making a plaster mould of a living person or thing. This was complex, technical\nwork, as Benjamin Robert Haydon discovered when he poured 250 litres of plaster over his\nhuman model and nearly killed him. At the time, the casts were used for medical research\nand, consequently, in the nineteenth century life-casting was considered inferior to\nsculpture in the same way that, more recently, photography was thought to be a lesser art\nthan painting. Both were viewed as unacceptable shortcuts by the ’senior 1 arts. Their\nvirtues of speed and unwavering realism also implied their limitations; they left little or no\nroom for the imagination.\n \nC For many, life-casting was an insult to the sculptor’s creative genius. In an infamous\nlawsuit of 1834, a moulder whose mask of the dying French emperor Napoleon had been\nreproduced and sold without his permission was judged to have no rights to the image. In\nother words, he was specifically held not to be an artist. This judgement reflect the view of\nestablished members of the nineteenth-century art world such as Rodin, who commented\nthat life-casting ‘happens fast but it doesn’t make Art’. Some even feared that ‘if too much\nnature was allowed in, it would lead Art away from its proper course of the Ideal.\n \nD The painter Gauguin, at the end of the nineteenth century, worried about future\ndevelopments in photography. If ever the process went into colour, what painter would\nlabour away at a likeness with a brush made from squirrel-tail? But painting has proved\nrobust. Photography has changed it, of course, just as the novel had to reassess narrative\nafter the arrival of the cinema. But the gap between the senior and junior arts was always\nnarrower than the traditionalists implied. Painters have always used technical back-up such\nas studio assistants to do the boring bits, while apparently lesser crafts involve great skill,\nthought, preparation and, depending on how we define it imagination.\nE Time changes our view in another way, too. Each new movement implies a\nreassessment of what has gone before. What is done now alters what was done before. In\nsome cases this is merely self-serving, with the new art using the old to justify itself. It\nseems to be saying, look at how all of that points to this! Aren’t we clever to be the\nculmination of all that has gone before? But usually it is a matter of re-alerting the\nsensibility, reminding us not to take things for granted. Take, for example, the cast of the\nhand of a giant from a circus, made by an anonymous artist around 1889, an item that\nwould now sit happily in any commercial or public gallery. The most significant impact of\nthis piece is on the eye, in the contradiction between unexpected size and verisimilitude.\nNext, the human element kicks in. you note that the nails are dirt-encrusted, unless this is\nthe caster’s decorative addition, and the fingertips extend far beyond them. Then you take\n \n1\n\n \nin the element of choice, arrangement, art if you like, in the neat, pleated, buttoned sleeve-\nend that gives the item balance and variation of texture. This is just a moulded hand, yet\nthe part stands utterly for the whole. It reminds us slyly, poignantly, of the full-size original\nF But is it art? And, if so, why? These are old tediously repeated questions to which artists\nhave often responded, ‘It is art because I am an artist and therefore what I do is art.\nHowever, what doesn’t work for literature works much better for art – works of art do float\nfree of their creators’ intentions. Over time the “reader” does become more powerful. Few\nof us can look at a medieval altarpiece as its painter intended. We believe too little and\naesthetically know too much, so we recreate and find new fields of pleasure in the work.\nEqually, the lack of artistic intention of Paul Richer and other forgotten craftsmen who\nbrushed oil onto flesh, who moulded, cast and decorated in the nineteenth century is now\nirrelevant. What counts is the surviving object and our response to it. The tests are simple:\ndoes it interest the eye, excite the brain, move the mind to reflection and involve the heart.\nIt may, to use the old dichotomy, be beautiful but it is rarely true to any significant depth.\nOne of the constant pleasures of art is its ability to come at us from an unexpected angle\nand stop us short in wonder.\n \n2",
