  "passage_text": "Reading Practice\n \nFacial Expression 1\n \nA\nA facial expression is one or more motions or positions of the muscles in the skin. These\nmovements convey the emotional state of the individual to observers. Facial expressions\nare a form of nonverbal communication. They are a primary means of conveying social\ninformation among aliens, but also occur in most other mammals and some other animal\nspecies. Facial expressions and their significance in the perceiver can, to some extent,\nvary between cultures with evidence from descriptions in the works of Charles Darwin. \n \nB\nHumans can adopt a facial expression to read as a voluntary action. However, because\nexpressions are closely tied to emotion, they are more often involuntary. It can be nearly\nimpossible to avoid expressions for certain emotions, even when it would be strongly\ndesirable to do so; a person who is trying to avoid insulting an individual he or she finds\nhighly unattractive might, nevertheless, show a brief expression of disgust before being\nable to reassume a neutral expression. Microexpressions are one example of this\nphenomenon. The close link between emotion and expression can also work in the order\ndirection; it has been observed that voluntarily assuming an expression can actually cause\nthe associated emotion. \n \nC\nSome expressions can be accurately interpreted even between members of different\nspecies – anger and extreme contentment being the primary examples. Others, however,\nare difficult to interpret even in familiar individuals. For instance, disgust and fear can be\ntough to tell apart. Because faces have only a limited range of movement, expressions rely\nupon fairly minuscule differences in the proportion and relative position of facial features,\nand reading them requires considerable sensitivity to the same. Some faces are often\nfalsely read as expressing some emotion, even when they are neutral because their\nproportions naturally resemble those another face would temporarily assume when\nemoting. \n \nD\nAlso, a person’s eyes reveal much about hos they are feeling, or what they are\nthinking. Blink rate can reveal how nervous or at ease a person maybe. Research by\nBoston College professor Joe Tecce suggests that stress levels are revealed by blink rates.\nHe supports his data with statistics on the relation between the blink rates of presidential\ncandidates and their success in their races. Tecce claims that the faster blinker in the\npresidential debates has lost every election since 1980. Though Tecce’s data is interesting,\nit is important to recognize that non-verbal communication is multi-channelled, and\nfocusing on only one aspect is reckless. Nervousness can also be measured by examining\neach candidates’ perspiration, eye contact and stiffness. \n \nE\nAs Charles Darwin noted in his book The Expression of the Emotions in Man and Animals:\nthe young and the old of widely different races, both with man and animals, express the\n \n1\n\nsame state of mind by the same movements. Still, up to the mid-20th century,\nmost anthropologists believed that facial expressions were entirely learned and could,\ntherefore, differ among cultures. Studies conducted in the 1960s by Paul Ekman eventually\nsupported Darwin’s belief to a large degree. \n \nF\nEkman’s work on facial expressions had its starting point in the work of psychologist Silvan\nTomkins. Ekman showed that contrary to the belief of some anthropologists including\nMargaret Mead, facial expressions of emotion are not culturally determined, but universal\nacross human cultures. The South Fore people of New Guinea were chosen as subjects for\none such survey. The study consisted of 189 adults and 130 children from among a very\nisolated population, as well as twenty-three members of the culture who lived a less\nisolated lifestyle as a control group. Participants were told a story that described one\nparticular emotion; they were then shown three pictures (two for children) of facial\nexpressions and asked to match the picture which expressed the story’s emotion. \n \nG\nWhile the isolated South Fore people could identify emotions with the same accuracy as\nthe non-isolated control group, problems associated with the study include the fact that\nboth fear and surprise were constantly misidentified. The study concluded that certain facial\nexpressions correspond to particular emotions and can not be covered, regardless of\ncultural background, and regardless of whether or not the culture has been isolated or\nexposed to the mainstream. \n \nH\nExpressions Ekman found to be universally included those indicating anger, disgust, fear,\njoy, sadness, and surprise (not that none of these emotions has a definitive social\ncomponent, such as shame, pride, or schadenfreude). Findings on contempt (which is\nsocial) are less clear, though there is at least some preliminary evidence that this emotion\nand its expression are universally recognized. This may suggest that the facial expressions\nare largely related to the mind and each part on the face can express specific emotion. \n \n2",
