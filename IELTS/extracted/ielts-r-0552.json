  "passage_text": "Reading Practice\n \nThe Search for the Anti-aging Pill\nIn government laboratories and elsewhere, scientists are seeking a drug able to\nprolong life and youthful vigor. Studies of caloric restriction are showing the way\nAs researchers on aging noted recently, no treatment on the market today has been proved\nto slow human aging - the build-up of molecular and cellular damage that increases\nvulnerability to infirmity as we grow older. But one intervention, consumption of a low-\ncalorie* yet nutritionally balanced diet, works incredibly well in a broad range of animals,\nincreasing longevity and prolonging good health. Those findings suggest that caloric\nrestriction could delay aging and increase longevity in humans, too.\nUnfortunately, for maximum benefit, people would probably have to reduce their caloric\nintake by roughly thirty per cent, equivalent to dropping from 2,500 calories a day to 1,750.\nFew mortals could stick to that harsh a regimen, especially for years on end. But what if\nsomeone could create a pill that mimicked the physiological effects of eating less without\nactually forcing people to eat less? Could such a ‘caloric-restriction mimetic’, as we call it,\nenable people to stay healthy longer, postponing age-related disorders (such as diabetes,\narteriosclerosis, heart disease and cancer) until very late in life? Scientists first posed this\nquestion in the mid-1990s, after researchers came upon a chemical agent that in rodents\nseemed to reproduce many of caloric restriction’s benefits. No compound that would safely\nachieve the same feat in people has been found yet, but the search has been informative\nand has fanned hope that caloric-restriction (CR) mimetics can indeed be developed\neventually.\nThe benefits of caloric restriction\nThe hunt for CR mimetics grew out of a desire to better understand caloric restriction’s\nmany effects on the body. Scientists first recognized the value of the practice more than 60\nyears ago, when they found that rats fed a low-calorie diet lived longer on average than\nfree-feeding rats and also had a reduced incidence of conditions that become increasingly\ncommon in old age. What is more, some of the treated animals survived longer than the\noldest-living animals in the control group, which means that the maximum lifespan (the\noldest attainable age), not merely the normal lifespan, increased. Various interventions,\nsuch as infection-fighting drugs, can increase a population’s average survival time, but only\napproaches that slow the body’s rate of aging will increase the maximum lifespan.\nThe rat findings have been replicated many times and extended to creatures ranging from\nyeast to fruit flies, worms, fish, spiders, mice and hamsters. Until fairly recently, the studies\nwere limited to short-lived creatures genetically distant from humans. But caloric-restriction\nprojects underway in two species more closely related to humans - rhesus and squirrel\nmonkeys - have made scientists optimistic that CR mimetics could help people.\nThe monkey projects demonstrate that, compared with control animals that eat normally,\ncaloric-restricted monkeys have lower body temperatures and levels of the pancreatic\nhormone insulin, and they retain more youthful levels of certain hormones that tend to fall\nwith age.\nThe caloric-restricted animals also look better on indicators of risk for age-related diseases.\nFor example, they have lower blood pressure and triglyceride levels (signifying a\n \n1\n\ndecreased likelihood of heart disease), and they have more normal blood glucose levels\n(pointing to a reduced risk for diabetes, which is marked by unusually high blood glucose\nlevels). Further, it has recently been shown that rhesus monkeys kept on caloric-restricted\ndiets for an extended time (nearly 15 years) have less chronic disease. They and the other\nmonkeys must be followed still longer, however, to know whether low-calorie intake can\nincrease both average and maximum lifespans in monkeys. Unlike the multitude of elixirs\nbeing touted as the latest anti-aging cure, CR mimetics would alter fundamental processes\nthat underlie aging. We aim to develop compounds that fool cells into activating\nmaintenance and repair.\nHow a prototype caloric-restriction mimetic works\nThe best-studied candidate for a caloric-restriction mimetic, 2DG (2-deoxy-D-glucose),\nworks by interfering with the way cells process glucose. It has proved toxic at some doses\nin animals and so cannot be used in humans. But it has demonstrated that chemicals can\nreplicate the effects of caloric restriction; the trick is finding the right one.\nCells use the glucose from food to generate ATP (adenosine triphosphate), the molecule\nthat powers many activities in the body. By limiting food intake, caloric restriction minimizes\nthe amount of glucose entering cells and decreases ATP generation. When 2DG is\nadministered to animals that eat normally, glucose reaches cells in abundance but the drug\nprevents most of it from being processed and thus reduces ATP synthesis. Researchers\nhave proposed several explanations for why interruption of glucose processing and ATP\nproduction might retard aging. One possibility relates to the ATP-making machinery’s\nemission of free radicals, which are thought to contribute to aging and to such age-related\ndiseases as cancer by damaging cells. Reduced operation of the machinery should limit\ntheir production and thereby constrain the damage. Another hypothesis suggests that\ndecreased processing of glucose could indicate to cells that food is scarce (even if it isn't)\nand induce them to shift into an anti-aging mode that emphasizes preservation of the\norganism over such ‘luxuries' as growth and reproduction.\n* caloric: a measure of the energy value of food\n \n2",
