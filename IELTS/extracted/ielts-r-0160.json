  "passage_text": "Reading Practice\n \nFear of the Unknown\nAmerican companies fear that innovation is the secret of success-and that they cannot\ninnovate\n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nIn the small Umagic office in midtown Manhattan, a team of 30 computer programmers are\nworking on setting up websites that will allow subscribers to feed in details about\nthemselves and their problems and to receive advice from ‘virtual’ versions of personalities\nregarded as experts in their fields: for example, a well-known dietician, a celebrity fitness\ntrainer, a psychologist well known in the media for here work on parent-child relationships .\nUmagic Systems is a young firm and it’s hard to predict how far they’ll go .hl ten years’\ntime, consulting a computer about your diet problems might seem natural or it might seem\nabsurd. But the company and others like it are beginning to seriously worry large American\nfirms, who see such half-crazy new and innovative ideas as a threat to their own future\nsuccess.\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nInnovation has become a major concern of American management. Firms have found that\nit is increasingly difficult to redesign existing products or to produce them more\neconomically. The stars of American business tend today to be innovators such as Amazon\n(the internet bookstore) and Wal-Mart (the supermarket chain) which have produced\ncompletely new ideas or products that have changed their industries.\n \n \n \n \n \nOver the past 15 years, the firms which have achieved the greatest profits have been the\nones which have had the most innovations. But such profits aren’t easy to come by .One of\nthe reasons for the increasing number of mergers between companies is a desperate\nsearch for new ideas. And a fortune is spent nowadays on identifying and protecting\nintellectual property: other people’s ideas.\nAccording to the Pasadena-based Patent & License Exchange in the United States ,\ntrading in intangible assets such as intellectual property rose from$15 billion in 1990 to $\n100 billion in 1998,with an increasing proportion of the rewards going to small firms and\nindividuals.\nAnd therein lies the terror for big companies : that innovation seems to work best outside\nthem. Many of the large established companies have been struggling to come up with new\nproducts recently.' In the management of creativity ,size is your enemy,’ argues Peter\nChemin ,who runs Fox TV and film empire for News Corporation. \"One person managing\n20 movies is never going to be as involved as one doing five movies .'He has thus tried to\nbreak down the studio into smaller units ,even at the risk of incurring higher costs.\nIt is easier for ideas to develop outside big firms these days. In the past, if a clever scientist\nhad an idea he wanted to commercialise ,he would take it first to a big company. Now, with\nthe banks encouraging individuals to set up new businesses through offering special loans,\ninnovators are more likely to set up on their own. Umagic has already raised $5 million and\nis about to raise $25 million more. Even in capital-intensive businesses such as\npharmaceuticals, entrepreneurs can conduct profitable, early- stage research,selling out to\nthe big firms when they reach expensive,risky clinical trials.\nSome giants, including General Electric and Cisco, have been remarkably successful at\nbuying up and integrating scores of small companies. But many others worry about the\n \n1\n\nprices they have to pay and the difficulty in keeping hold of the people who dreamt up the\nideas . Everybody would like to develop more ideas in-house. Procter & Gamble is now\nchanging the entire direction of its business from global expansion to product development;\none of its new aims is to get innovations accepted across the company .Elsewhere ,the\nsearch for innovation had led to a craze for ' intrapreneurship ’ -giving more power to\nindividuals in the company and setting up internal ideas -factories so that talents staff will\nnot leave.\nAnd yet innovation does not happen just because the chief executive wills it. Indeed ,it is\nextremely difficult to come up with new ideas year in, year out, especially brilliant ones.\nUnderneath all experts' diagrams , lists and charts ,most of the available answers seem to\nfocus on two strengths that are difficult to impose: a culture that looks for new ideas, and\nleaders who know which ones to back. Companies have to discredit the widespread view\nthat jobs working on new products are for ‘those who can't cope in the real business'. They\nhave to change the culture by introducing hard incentives, such as giving more generous\nbonuses to those who come up with successful new ideas and, particularly ,not punishing\nthose whose experiments fail.\nWill all this reorganization and culture tweaking make big firms more creative? David Post,\nthe founder of Umagic, isn't so sure:’ He also recalls with glee the looks of total\nincomprehension when he tried to sell his 'virtual experts ' idea three years ago to firms\nsuch IBM , though ,as he cheerfully adds,’ of course, they could have been right'.\nApparently, innovation -unlike diet,fitness and parenting -is one area where a computer\ncannot tell you what to do.\n \n2",
