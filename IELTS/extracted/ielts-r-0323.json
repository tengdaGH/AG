  "passage_text": "Reading Practice\n \nOptimism and Health\nMindset is all. How you start the year will set the template for the rest, and two\nscientifically backed character traits hold the key: optimism and resilience (if the\nprospect leaves you feeling pessimistically spineless, the good news is that you can\nsignificantly boost both of these qualities).\nFaced with 12 months of plummeting economics and rising human distress, staunchly\nmaintaining a rosy view might seem deludedly Pollyannaish. But here we encounter the\noptimism paradox. As Brice Pitt, an emeritus professor of the psychiatry of old age at\nImperial College, London, told me: “Optimists are unrealistic. Depressive people see things\nas they really are, but that is a disadvantage from an evolutionary point of view. Optimism\nis a piece of evolutionary equipment that carried us through millennia of setbacks.”\nOptimists have plenty to be happy about. In other words, if you can convince yourself that\nthings will get better, the odds of it happening will improve - because you keep on playing\nthe game. In this light, optimism “is a habitual way of explaining your setbacks to yourself”,\nreports Martin Seligman, the psychology professor and author of Learned Optimism. The\nresearch shows that when times get tough, optimists do better than pessimists - they\nsucceed better at work, respond better to stress, suffer fewer depressive episodes, and\nachieve more personal goals.\nStudies also show that belief can help with the financial pinch. Chad Wallens, a social\nforecaster at the Henley Centre who surveyed middle-class Britons’ beliefs about income,\nhas found that “the people who feel wealthiest, and those who feel poorest, actually have\nalmost the same amount of money at their disposal. Their attitudes and behaviour patterns,\nhowever, are different from one another.”\nOptimists have something else to be cheerful about - in general, they are more robust. For\nexample, a study of 660 volunteers by the Yale University psychologist Dr. Becca Levy\nfound that thinking positively adds an average of seven years to your life. Other American\nresearch claims to have identified a physical mechanism behind this. A Harvard Medical\nSchool study of 670 men found that the optimists have significantly better lung function.\nThe lead author, Dr. Rosalind Wright, believes that attitude somehow strengthens the\nimmune system. “Preliminary studies on heart patients suggest that, by changing a\nperson’s outlook, you can improve their mortality risk,” she says.\nFew studies have tried to ascertain the proportion of optimists in the world. But a 1995\nnationwide survey conducted by the American magazine Adweek found that about half the\npopulation counted themselves as optimists, with women slightly more apt than men (53\nper cent versus 48 per cent) to see the sunny side.\nOf course, there is no guarantee that optimism will insulate you from the crunch’s worst\neffects, but the best strategy is still to keep smiling and thank your lucky stars. Because (as\nevery good sports coach knows) adversity is character-forming - so long as you practise\nthe skills of resilience. Research among tycoons and business leaders shows that the path\nto success is often littered with failure: a record of sackings, bankruptcies and blistering\ncastigation. But instead of curling into a foetal ball beneath the coffee table, they resiliently\npick themselves up, learn from their pratfalls and march boldly towards the next\nopportunity.\n \n1\n\nThe American Psychological Association defines resilience as the ability to adapt in the\nface of adversity, trauma or tragedy. A resilient person may go through difficulty and\nuncertainty, but he or she will doggedly bounce back.\nOptimism is one of the central traits required in building resilience, say Yale University\ninvestigators in the. Annual Review of Clinical Psychology. They add that resilient people\nlearn to hold on to their sense of humour and this can help them to keep a flexible attitude\nwhen big changes of plan are warranted. The ability to accept your lot with equanimity also\nplays an important role, the study adds.\nOne of the best ways to acquire resilience is through experiencing a difficult childhood, the\nsociologist Steven Stack reports in the Journal of Social Psychology. For example, short\nmen are less likely to commit suicide than tall guys, he says, because shorties develop\npsychological defence skills to handle the bullies and mickey-taking that their lack of\nstature attracts. By contrast, those who enjoyed adversity-free youths can get derailed by\nsetbacks later on because they’ve never been inoculated against aggro.\nIf you are handicapped by having had a happy childhood, then practising proactive\noptimism can help you to become more resilient. Studies of resilient people show that they\ntake more risks; 'they court failure and learn not to fear it.\nAnd despite being thick-skinned, resilient types are also more open than average to other\npeople. Bouncing through knock-backs is all part of the process.\nIt’s about optimistic risk-taking - being confident that people will like you. Simply smiling\nand being warm to people can help. It’s an altruistic path to self-interest - and if it achieves\nnothing else, it will reinforce an age-old adage: hard times can bring out the best in you.\n \n2",
