  "passage_text": "Reading Practice\n \nOut of Africa: Saharan Solar Energy\nVivienne Wait reports on how the Sahara Desert could offer a truly green solution to\nEurope’s energy problems\n \n \nA\nFor years, the Sahara has been regarded by many Europeans as a terra incognita* of little\neconomic value or importance. But this idea may soon change completely. Politicians and\nscientists on both sides of the Mediterranean are beginning to focus on the Sahara’s\npotential to provide power for Europe in the future. They believe the desert’s true value\ncomes from the fact that it is dry and empty. Some areas of the Sahara reach 45 degrees\ncentigrade on many afternoons. It is, in other words, a gigantic natural storehouse of solar\nenergy.\nB\nA few years ago, scientists began to calculate just how much energy the Sahara holds.\nThey were astonished at the answer. In theory, a 90,600 square kilometre chunk of the\nSahara - smaller than Portugal and a little over 1% of its total area - could yield the same\namount of electricity as all the world’s power plants combined. A smaller square of 15,500\nsquare kilometres - about the size of Connecticut - could provide electricity for Europe’s\n500 million people.\n'I admit I was sceptical until 1 did the calculations myself,’ says Michael Pawlyn, director of\nExploration Architecture, one of three British environmental companies comprising the\nSahara Forest Project, which is testing solar plants in Oman and the United Arab Emirates.\nPawlyn calls the Sahara’s potential ’staggering’.\nC\nAt the moment, no one is proposing the creation of a solar power station the size of a small\ncountry. But a relatively well-developed technology exists, which proponents say could turn\nthe Sahara’s heat and sunlight into a major source of electricity - Concentrating Solar\nPower [CSP], Unlike solar panels, which convert sunlight directly into electricity, CSP\nutilises mirrors which focus light on water pipes or boilers to produce very hot steam to\noperate the turbines of generators. Small CSP plants have produced power in California’s\nMojave Desert since the 1980s. The Sahara Forest Project proposes building CSP plants\nin areas below sea level (the Sahara has several such depressions) so that sea water can\nflow into them. This water would then be purified and used for powering turbines and\nwashing dust off the mirrors. Waste water would then supply irrigation to areas around the\nstations, creating lush oases - hence the ’forest’ in the group’s name.\n     \nD\nBut producing Significant quantities of electricity means building huge arrays of mirrors and\npipes across hundreds of miles of remote desert, which is expensive. Gerry Wolff, an\nengineer who heads DESERTEC, an international consortium of solar-power scientists,\nsays they have estimated it will cost about $59 billion to begin transmitting power from the\nSahara by 2020.\n \n1\n\nE\nBuilding plants is just part of the challenge. One of the drawbacks to CSP technology is\nthat it works at maximum efficiency only in sunny, hot climates - and deserts tend to be\ndistant from population centres. To supply Europe with 20% of its electricity needs, more\nthan 19,300 kilometres of cables would need to be laid under the Mediterranean, says\nGunnar Asplund, head of HVDC research at ABB Power Technologies in Ludvika, Sweden.\nIndeed, to use renewable sources of power, including solar, wind and tidal, Europe will\nneed to build completely new electrical grids. That’s because existing infrastructures, built\nlargely for the coal- fired plants that supply 80% of Europe’s power, would not be suitable\nfor carrying the amount of electricity generated by the Sahara. Germany’s government-run\nAerospace Centre, which researches energy, estimates that replacing those lines could\nraise the cost of building solar plants in the Sahara and sending significant amounts of\npower to Europe to about $485 billion over the next 40 years. Generous government\nsubsidies will be needed. ‘Of course it costs a lot of money,’ says Asplund. ‘It’s a lot\ncheaper to burn coal than to make solar power in the Sahara.’\nF\nMeanwhile, some companies are getting started. Seville engineering company Abengoa is\nbuilding one solar- thermal plant in Algeria and another in Morocco, while a third is being\nbuilt in Egypt by a Spanish-Japanese joint venture. The next step will be to get cables in\nplace. Although the European Parliament has passed a law that aids investors who help\nthe continent reach its goal of getting 20% of itg power from renewable energy by 2020, it\ncould take years to create the necessary infrastructure.\nG\n \nNicholas Dunlop, secretary-general of the London-based NGO e-Parliament, thinks\ncompanies should begin transmitting small amounts of solar power as soon as the North\nAfrican plants begin operating, by linking a few cable lines under the Med. 'I call it the Lego\nmethod,’ he says. ‘Build it piece by piece.’ If It can be shown that power from the Sahara\ncan be produced profitably, he says, companies and governments will soon jump in. If they\ndo, perhaps airplane passengers flying across the Sahara will one day count the mirrors\nand patches of green instead of staring at sand.\n \nadapted from Time Magazine\n*terra incognita - Latin, meaning ‘an unknown land'\n \n2",
