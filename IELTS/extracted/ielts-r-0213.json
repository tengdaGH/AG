Today, you would need a sizeable library, with\nplenty of room for expansion, to house them. The last few decades have seen the stream\nof new titles swell into a flood. In 1975, 771 business books were published. By 2000, the\ntotal for the year had risen to 3,203, and the trend continues.\nB\nThe growth in pubishing activity has followed the rise and rise of management to the point\nwhere it constitutes a mini-industry in its own right. In the USA alone, the book market is\nworth over $lbn. Management consultancies, professional bodies and business schools\nwere part of this new phenomenon, all sharing at least one common need: to get into print.\nNor were they the only aspiring authors. Inside stories by and about business leaders\nbalanced the more straight-laced textbooks by academics. How-to books by practising\nmanagers and business writers appeared on everything from making a presentation to\ndeveloping a business strategy. With this upsurge in output, it is not really surprising that\nthe quality is uneven.\nC\nFew people are probably in a better position to evaluate the management canon than Carol\nKennedy, a business journalist and author of Guide to the Management Gurus, an\noverview of the world’s most influential management thinkers and their works. She is also\nthe books editor of The Director. Of course, it is normally the best of the bunch that are\nreviewed in the pages of The Director. But from time to time, Kennedy is moved to use The\nDirector’s precious column inches to warn readers off certain books. Her recent review of\nThe Leader’s Edge summed up her irritation with authors who over-promise and under-\ndeliver. The banality of the treatment of core competencies for leaders, including the\n‘competency of paying attention’, was a conceit too far in the context of a leaden text.\n‘Somewhere in this book,’ she wrote,‘there may be an idea worth reading and taking note\nof, but my own competency of paying attention ran out on page 31.’ Her opinion of a good\nproportion of the other books that never make it to the review pages is even more\nterse.‘Unreadable’ is her verdict.\n \nD\nSimon Caulkin, contributing editor of the Observer’s management page and former editor\nof Management Today, has formed a similar opinion. A lot is pretty depressing,\nunimpressive stuff.’ Caulkin is philosophical about the inevitability of finding so much dross.\nBusiness books, he says,‘range from total drivel to the ambitious stuff. Although the\nconfusing thing is that the really ambitious stuff can sometimes be drivel.’ Which leaves the\nquestion open as to why the subject of management is such a literary wasteland. There are\nsome possible explanations.\n \nE\n \n1\n\nDespite the attempts of Frederick Taylor, the early twentieth-century founder of scientific\nmanagement, to establish a solid, rule-based foundation for the practice, management has\ncome to be seen as just as much an art as a science. Once psychologists like Abraham\nMaslow, behaviouralists and social anthropologists persuaded business to look at\nmanagement from a human perspective, the topic became more multidimensional and\ncomplex. Add to that the requirement for management to reflect the changing demands of\nthe times, the impact of information technology and other factors, and it is easy to\nunderstand why management is in a permanent state of confusion. There is a constant\nrequirement for reinterpretation, innovation and creative thinking: Caulkin’s ambitious stuff.\nFor their part, publishers continue to dream about finding the next big management idea, a\ntopic given an airing in Kennedy’s book. The Next Big Idea.\n \nF\nIndirectly, it tracks one of the phenomena of the past 20 years or so: the management\nblockbusters which work wonders for publishers’ profits and transform authors’ careers.\nPeters and Waterman’s In Search of Excellence: Lessons from America’s Best-Run\nCompanies achieved spectacular success. So did Michael Hammer and James Champy’s\nbook. Reengineering the Corporation: A Manifesto for Business Revolution. Yet the early\neuphoria with which such books are greeted tends to wear off as the basis for the claims\nstarts to look less than solid. In the case of In Search of Excellence, it was the rapid\nreversal of fortunes that turned several of the exemplar companies into basket cases. For\nHammer’s and Champy’s readers, disillusion dawned with the realisation that their slash-\nand-burn prescription for reviving corporate fortunes caused more problems than it solved.\n \nG\nYet one of the virtues of these books is that they could be understood.There is a whole\nclass of management texts that fail this basic test.‘Some management books are stuffed\nwith jargon,’ says Kennedy.‘Consultants are among the worst offenders.’ She believes\nthere is a simple reason for this flight from plain English.’They all use this jargon because\nthey can’c think clearly. It disguises the paucity of thought.’\n \nH\nBy contrast, the management thinkers who have stood the test of time articulate their ideas\nin plain English. Peter Drucker, widely regarded as the doyen of management thinkers, has\nwritten a steady stream of influential books over half a century. ‘Drucker writes beautiful,\ndear prose.’ says Kennedy, ‘and his thoughts come through.’ He is among the handful of\nwriters whose work, she believes, transcends the specific interests of the management\ncommunity. Caulkin also agrees that Drucker reaches out to a wider readership. ‘What you\nget is a sense of the larger cultural background,’ he says.‘That’s what you miss in so much\nmanagement writing.’ Charles Handy, perhaps the most successful UK business writer to\ncommand an international audience, is another rare example of a writer with a message for\nthe wider world.\n \n2",
