A violent eruption can blow the top\nfew kilometres off a mountain, scatter fine ash practically all over the globe and hurl rock\nfragments into the stratosphere to darken the skies a continent away.\nBut the classic eruption - cone-shaped mountain, big bang, mushroom cloud and surges of\nmolten lava - is only a tiny part of a global story. Vulcanism, the name given to volcanic\nprocesses, really has shaped the world. Eruptions have rifted continents, raised mountain\nchains, constructed islands and shaped the topography of the earth. The entire ocean floor\nhas a basement of volcanic basalt.\nVolcanoes have not only made the continents, they are also thought to have made the\nworld's first stable atmosphere and provided all the water for the oceans, rivers and ice-\ncaps. There are now about 600 active volcanoes. Every year they add two or three cubic\nkilometres of rock to the continents. Imagine a similar number of volcanoes smoking away\nfor the last 3,500 million years. That is enough rock to explain the continental crust.\nWhat comes out of volcanic craters is mostly gas. More than 90% of this gas is water\nvapour from the deep earth: enough to explain, over 3,500 million years, the water in the\noceans. The rest of the gas is nitrogen, carbon dioxide, sulphur dioxide, methane,\nammonia and hydrogen. The quantity of these gases, again multiplied over 3,500 million\nyears, is enough to explain the mass of the world's atmosphere. We are alive because\nvolcanoes provided the soil, air and water we need.\nB\nGeologists consider the earth as having a molten core, surrounded by a semi-molten\nmantle and a brittle, outer skin. It helps to think of a soft-boiled egg with a runny yolk, a firm\nbut squishy white and a hard shell. If the shell is even slightly cracked during boiling, the\nwhite material bubbles out and sets like a tiny mountain chain over the crack - like an\narchipelago of volcanic islands such as the Hawaiian Islands. But the earth is so much\nbigger and the mantle below is so much hotter.\nEven though the mantle rocks are kept solid by overlying pressure, they can still slowly\n'flow' like thick treacle. The flow, thought to be in the form of convection currents, is\npowerful enough to fracture the 'eggshell' of the crust into plates, and keep them bumping\nand grinding against each other, or even overlapping, at the rate of a few centimetres a\nyear. These fracture zones, where the collisions occur, are where earthquakes happen.\nAnd, very often, volcanoes.\nC\nThese zones are lines of weakness, or hot spots. Every eruption is different, but put at its\nsimplest, where there are weaknesses, rocks deep in the mantle, heated to 1,350°C, will\nstart to expand and rise. As they do so, the pressure drops, and they expand and become\n \n1\n\nliquid and rise more swiftly.\nSometimes it is slow: vast bubbles of magma - molten rock from the mantle - inch towards\nthe surface, cooling slowly, to snow through as granite extrusions (as on Skye, or the Great\nWhin Sill, the lava dyke squeezed out like toothpaste that carries part of Hadrian's Wall in\nnorthern England). Sometimes - as in Northern Ireland, Wales and the Karoo in South\nAfrica - the magma rose faster, and then flowed out horizontally on to the surface in vast\nthick sheets. In the Deccan plateau in western India, there are more than two million cubic\nkilometres of lava, some of it 2,400 metres thick, formed over 500,000 years of slurping\neruption.\nSometimes the magma moves very swiftly indeed. It does not have time to cool as it surges\nupwards. The gases trapped inside the boiling rock expand suddenly, the lava glows with\nheat, it begins to froth, and it explodes with tremendous force. Then the slightly cooler lava\nfollowing it begins to flow over the lip of the crater. It happens on Mars, it happened on the\nmoon, it even happens on some of the moons of Jupiter and Uranus. By studying the\nevidence, vulcanologists can read the force of the great blasts of the past. Is the pumice\nlight and full of holes? The explosion was tremendous. Are the rocks heavy, with huge\ncrystalline basalt shapes, like the Giant's Causeway in Northern Ireland? It was a slow,\ngentle eruption.\nThe biggest eruptions are deep on the mid-ocean floor, where new lava is forcing the\ncontinents apart and widening the Atlantic by perhaps five centimetres a year. Look at\nmaps of volcanoes, earthquakes and island chains like the Philippines and Japan, and you\ncan see the rough outlines of what are called tectonic plates - the plates which make up the\nearth's crust and mantle. The most dramatic of these is the Pacific 'ring of fire' where there\nhave been the most violent explosions - Mount Pinatubo near Manila, Mount St Helen's in\nthe Rockies and El Chichon in Mexico about a decade ago, not to mention world-shaking\nblasts like Krakatoa in the Sunda Straits in 1883.\nD\nBut volcanoes are not very predictable. That is because geological time is not like human\ntime. During quiet periods, volcanoes cap themselves with their own lava by forming a\npowerful cone from the molten rocks slopping over the rim of the crater; later the lava cools\nslowly into a huge, hard, stable plug which blocks any further eruption until the pressure\nbelow becomes irresistible. In the case of Mount Pinatubo, this took 600 years.\nThen, sometimes, with only a small warning, the mountain blows its top. It did this at Mont\nPelee in Martinique at 7.49 a.m. on 8 May, 1902. Of a town of 28,000, only two people\nsurvived. In 1 815, a sudden blast removed the top 1,280 metres of Mount Tambora in\nIndonesia. The eruption was so fierce that dust thrown into the stratosphere darkened the\nskies, cancelling the following summer in Europe and North America. Thousands starved\nas the harvests failed, after snow in June and frosts in August. Volcanoes are potentially\nworld news, especially the quiet ones.\n \n2",
