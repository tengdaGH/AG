  "passage_text": "Reading Practice\n \nA Theory of Shopping\nFor a one-year period I attempted to conduct an ethnography of shopping on and around a\nstreet in North London. This was carried out in association with Alison Clarke. I say\n‘attempted’ because, given the absence of community and the intensely private nature of\nLondon households, this could not be an ethnography in the conventional sense.\nNevertheless, through conversation, being present in the home and accompanying\nhouseholders during their shopping, I tried to reach an understanding of the nature of\nshopping through greater or lesser exposure to 76 households.\nMy part of the ethnography concentrated upon shopping itself. Alison Clarke has since\nbeen working with the same households, but focusing upon other forms of provisioning\nsuch as the use of catalogues (see Clarke 1997). We generally first met these households\ntogether, but most of the material that is used within this particular essay derived from my\nown subsequent fieldwork. Following the completion of this essay, and a study of some\nrelated shopping centres, we hope to write a more general ethnography of provisioning.\nThis will also examine other issues, such as the nature of community and the implications\nfor retail and for the wider political economy. None of this, however, forms part of the\npresent essay, which is primarily concerned with establishing the cosmological foundations\nof shopping.\nTo state that a household has been included within the study is to gloss over a wide\ndiversity of degrees of involvement. The minimum requirement is simply that a householder\nhas agreed to be interviewed about their shopping, which would include the local shopping\nparade, shopping centres and supermarkets. At the other extreme are families that we\nhave come to know well during the course of the year. Interaction would include formal\ninterviews, and a less formal presence within their homes, usually with a cup of tea. It also\nmeant accompanying them on one or several ‘events’, which might comprise shopping trips\nor participation in activities associated with the area of Clarke’s study, such as the meeting\nof a group supplying products for the home.\nIn analysing and writing up the experience of an ethnography of shopping in North London,\nI am led in two opposed directions. The tradition of anthropological relativism leads to an\nemphasis upon difference, and there are many ways in which shopping can help us\nelucidate differences. For example, there are differences in the experience of shopping\nbased on gender, age, ethnicity and class. There are also differences based on the various\ngenres of shopping experience, from a mall to a corner shop. By contrast, there is the\ntradition of anthropological generalisation about ‘peoples’ and comparative theory. This\nleads to the question as to whether there are any fundamental aspects of shopping which\nsuggest a robust normativity that comes through the research and is not entirely dissipated\nby relativism. In this essay I want to emphasize the latter approach and argue that if not all,\nthen most acts of shopping on this street exhibit a normative form which needs to be\naddressed. In the later discussion of the discourse of shopping I will defend the possibility\nthat such a heterogenous group of households could be fairly represented by a series of\nhomogenous cultural practices.\nThe theory that I will propose is certainly at odds with most of the literature on this topic. My\npremise, unlike that of most studies of consumption, whether they arise from economists,\nbusiness studies or cultural studies, is that for most households in this street the act of\n \n1\n\nshopping was hardly ever directed towards the person who was doing the shopping.\nShopping is therefore not best understood as an individualistic or individualising act related\nto the subjectivity of the shopper. Rather, the act of buying goods is mainly directed at two\nforms of ‘otherness’. The first of these expresses a relationship between the shopper and a\nparticular other individual such as a child or partner, either present in the household,\ndesired or imagined. The second of these is a relationship to a more general goal which\ntranscends any immediate utility and is best understood as cosmological in that it takes the\nform of neither subject nor object but of the values to which people wish to dedicate\nthemselves.\nIt never occurred to me at any stage when carrying out the ethnography that I should\nconsider the topic of sacrifice as relevant to this research. In no sense then could the\nethnography be regarded as a testing of the ideas presented here. The Literature that\nseemed most relevant in the initial anaLysis of the London material was that on thrift\ndiscussed in chapter 3. The crucial element in opening up the potential of sacrifice for\nunderstanding shopping came through reading Bataiile. Bataille, however, was merely the\ncatalyst, since I will argue that it is the classic works on sacrifice and, in particular, the\nfoundation to its modern study by Hubert and Mauss (1964) that has become the primary\ngrounds for my interpretation. It is important, however, when reading the following account\nto note that when I use the word ‘sacrifice’, I only rarely refer to the colLoquial sense of the\nterm as used in the concept of the ‘self-sacrificial’ housewife. Mostly the allusion is to this\nLiterature on ancient sacrifice and the detailed analysis of the complex ritual sequence\ninvolved in traditional sacrifice. The metaphorical use of the term may have its place within\nthe subsequent discussion but this is secondary to an argument at the level of structure.\n \n2",
