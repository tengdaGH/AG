  "passage_text": "Reading Practice\n \nBlue-footed Boobies 2\n  \nA\nBoobies are a small group of seabirds native to tropical and subtropical oceans throughout\nthe world. Their diet consists mainly of fish. They are specialized fish eaters feeding on\nsmall school fish like sardines, anchovies, mackerel, and flying fish. When their prey is in\nsight, they fold their long wings back around their streamlined bodies and plunge into the\nwater from as high as 80 feet, so streamlined they barely make a splash. They travel in\nparties of about 12 to areas of water with large schools of small fish. When the lead bird\nsees a fish shoal in the water, it will signal the rest of the group and they will all dive\ntogether. Surprisingly, individuals do not eat with the hunting group, preferring to eat on\ntheir own, usually in the early morning or late afternoon.\n  \nB\nThere are three varieties on the Galapagos: the blue-footed, red-footed, and masked\nboobies. They are all members of the same family, and are not only different in appearance\nbut also in behaviours. The blue-footed and red-footed boobies mate throughout the year,\nwhile the masked boobies have an annual mating cycle that differs from island to island. All\ncatch fish in a similar manner, but in different areas: the blue-footed booby does its fishing\nclose to shore, while the masked booby goes slightly farther out, and the red-footed booby\nfishes at the farthest distances from shore.\n  \nC\nAlthough it is unknown where the name “Booby” emanates from, some conjecture it may\ncome from the Spanish word for clown, “bobo”, meaning “stupid”. Its name was probably\ninspired by the bird’s clumsiness on land and apparently unwarranted bravery. The blue\nfooted booby is extremely vulnerable to human visitors because it does not appear to fear\nthem. Therefore these birds received such name for their clumsiness on land in which they\nwere easy, captured, killed, and eaten by humans.\n   \nD\nThe blue-footed booby’s characteristic feet play a significant part in their famous courtship\nceremony, the ‘booby dance’. The male walks around the female, raising his bright blue\nfeet straight up in the air while bringing his ‘shoulders’ towards the ground and crossing the\nbottom tips of his wings high above the ground. Plus he’ll raise his bill up towards the sky to\ntry to win his mate over. The female may also partake in these activities – lifting her feet,\nsky pointing, and of course, squawking at her mate. After mating, another ritual occurs –\nthe nest-building which ironically is never used because they nest on the bare ground.\nWhen the female is ready to lay her eggs, they scrape the existing nest away so she can\nnest on exposed ground. Sun-baked islands form the booby’s breeding grounds. When\nready the female Blue Footed Booby lays one to three eggs.\n   \nE\nAfter mating, two or three eggs are laid in a shallow depression on flat or gently sloping\nground. Both male and female take turns incubating the eggs. Unlike most birds, booby\ndoesn’t develop brood patches (areas of bare skin on the breast) to warm the eggs during\n \n1\n\nincubation. Instead, it uses its broad webbed feet, which have large numbers of prominent\nblood vessels, to transmit heat essential for incubation. The eggs are thick-shelled so they\ncan withstand the full weight of an incubating bird.\n  \nF\nAfter hatching, the male plays a major role in bringing fish home. He can bring back a\nconstant supply of small fish for the chicks, which must be fed continuously. The reason is\nthat the male has a longer tail than the female in relation to his body size, which makes him\nable to execute shallower dives and to feed closer to shore. Then the female takes a\ngreater part as time proceeds. Sooner or later, the need to feed the young becomes\ngreater than the need to protect them and both adults must fish to provide enough.\n  \nG\nWhen times are good, the parents may successfully fledge all three chicks, but, in harder\ntimes, they may still lay as many eggs yet only obtain enough food to raise one. The\nproblem is usually solved by the somewhat callous-sounding system of “opportunistic\nsibling murder.” The first-born chick is larger and stronger than its nest mate(s) as a result\nof hatching a few days earlier and also because the parents feed the larger chick. If food is\nscarce, the first born will get more food than its nest mate(s) and will outcompete them,\ncausing them to starve. The above system optimizes the reproductive capacity of the blue-\nfoot in an unpredictable environment. The system ensures that, if possible, at least one\nchick will survive a period of shortage rather than all three dying of starvation under a more\n‘humane’ system.\n \n2",
