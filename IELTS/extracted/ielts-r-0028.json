  "passage_text": "Reading Practice\n \nAn important language development\nCuneiform, the world’s first known system of handwriting, originated some 6.000 years ago\nin Summer in what is now southern Iraq. It was most often inscribed on palmsized,\nrectangular clay tablets measuring several centimetres across, although occasionally,\nlarger tablets or cylinders were used. Clay was an excellent medium for writing. Other\nsurfaces which have been employed - for example, parchment, papyrus and paper - are\nnot long - lasting and are easily destroyed by fire and water. But clay has proved to be\nresistant to those particular kinds of damage.\nThe word ‘cuneiform’ actually refers to the marks or signs inscribed in the clay. The original\ncuneiform signs consisted of a series of lines - triangular, vertical, diagonal and horizontal.\nSumerian writers would impress these lines into the wet clay with a stylus - a long, thin,\npointed instrument which looked somewhat like a pen. Oddly, the signs were often almost\ntoo small to see with the naked eye. Cuneiform signs were used for the writing of at least a\ndozen languages. This is similar to how the Latin alphabet is used today for writing English,\nFrench, Spanish and German for example.\n \nBefore the development of cuneiform, tokens were used by the Sumerians to record certain\ninformation. For example, they might take small stones and use them as tokens or\nrepresentations of something else, like a goat. A number of tokens, then, might mean a\nherd of goat. These tokens might then be placed in a cloth container and provided to a\nbuyer as a receipt for a transaction, perhaps five tokens for five animals. It was not that\ndifferent from what we do today when we buy some bread and the clerk gives us back a\npiece of paper with numbers on it to confirm the exchange.\nBy the 4th century BCE, the Sumerians had adapted this system to a form of writing. They\nbegan putting tokens in a container resembling an envelope, and now made of clay instead\nof cloth. They then stamped the outside to indicate the number and type of tokens inside. A\nperson could then ‘read’ what was stamped on the container and know what was inside.\nGradually, Sumerians developed symbols for words. When first developed, each symbol\nlooked like the concrete thing it represented. For example, an image which resembled the\ndrawing of a sheep meant just that. Then another level of abstraction was introduced when\nsymbols were developed for intangible ideas such as ‘female’ of\n‘hot’ or ‘God’. Cuneiform, in other words, evolved from a way used primarily to track and\nstore information into a way to represent the world symbolically. Over the centuries, the\nmarks became ever more abstract, finally evolving into signs that looked nothing like what\nthey referred to, just as the letters ‘h-o-u-s-e’ have no visual connection to the place we live\nin. At this last stage in the evolution of cuneiform, the signs took the form of tringles, which\nbecame common cuneiform signs.\nAs the marks became more abstract, the system became more efficient because there\nwere fewer marks a ‘reader’ needed to learn. But cuneiform also became more complex\nbecause society itself was becoming more complex, so there were more ideas and\nconcepts that needed to be expressed. However, most linguists and historians agree\ncuneiform developed primarily as a tool for accounting. Of the cuneiform tablets that have\nbeen discovered, excavated and translated, about 75 percent contain this type of practical\ninformation, rather than artistic or imaginative work.\n \n1\n\n \n \nCuneiform writing was used for thousands of years, but it eventually ceased to be used in\neveryday life. In fact, it died out and remained unintelligible for almost 2.000 years. In the\nlate 19th century, a British army officer, Henry Rawlinson, discovered cuneiform\ninscriptions which had been carved in the surface of rocks in the Behistun mountains in\nwhat is present-day Iran. Rawlinson made impressions of the marks on large pieces of\npaper, as he balanced dangerously on the surrounding rocks.\nRawlinson took his copies home to Britain and studied them for years to determine what\neach line stood for, and what each group of symbols meant. He found that in the writing on\nthose particular rocks every word was repeated three times in three languages: Old\nPersian, Elamite and Babylonian. Since the meanings in these languages were already\nknown to linguists, he could thus translate the cuneiform. Eventually, he fully decoded the\ncuneiform marks and he discovered that they described the life of Darius, a king of the\nPersian Empire in the 5th century BCE.\n \n2",
