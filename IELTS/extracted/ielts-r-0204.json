  "passage_text": "Reading Practice\nHow Do Many Hearing-impaired People Talk?\nHearing-impaired people cannot hear sounds well. How do they “hear” words?\nMany hearing-impaired people use sign language. They talk with their hands. Two hearing-\nimpaired people can talk to each other. They both use sign language. Sometimes a person\nwho can hear and interprets for hearing-impaired people. The person listens to someone\ntalking, and then he or she makes hand signs. There are two kinds of hand sign. Some\nsigns are for whole words. For example, there is one hand sign for the word love. There are\nhand signs for different actions, things, and ideas. Some of the signs are very easy, for\nexample, the sign for eat, milk, and house. You can see what they mean. Others are more\ndifficult, for example, the sign for star, egg, and week.\nThe second kind of hand sign is fingerspelling. In fingerspelling, there is a sign for every\nletter in the alphabet. For example, to fingerspell the word love, a person makes four\ndifferent signs. It is much slower to fingerspell, but is useful for signing names and technical\nwords. People can use both kinds of hand signs together.\nEach country has its own sign language. For example, American Sign Language (ASL) is\nvery different from British Sign Language. Using sign language is almost like a dance. The\nwhole body talks. Sign languages are beautiful.\n \n1",
