  "passage_text": "Reading Practice\n \nDino discoveries\nWhen news breaks of the discovery of a new species of dinosaur, you would be forgiven\nfor thinking that the scientists who set out in search of the fossils are the ones who made\ndie find. The reality tells a different story, as Cavan Scott explains.\nThe BBC series Planet Dinosaur used state-of-the-art computer graphics to bring to life the\nmost impressive of those dinosaurs whose remains have been discovered in the past\ndecade. One of these is Gigantoraptor erlianensis. Discovered in 2005. it stands more than\nthree metres high at the hip and is the biggest bird-like dinosaur ever unearthed Yet its\ndiscoverer. Xu Xing of Beijing's Institute of Vertebrate Palaeontology and\nPaleoanthropology, was not even looking for it at the time. He was recording a\ndocumentary in the Gobi Desert. Inner Mongolia.\n'The production team were filming me and a geologist digging out what we thought were\nsauropod bones.' says Xu. 'when I realised the fossils were something else entirely.'\nGigantoraptor, as it later became known, turned out to be an oviraptorid, a therapod with a\nbird-like beak. Its size was staggering. The largest oviraptorid previously discovered had\nbeen comparable in size to an emu: the majority were about as big as a turkey. Here was a\ncreature that was probably about eight metres long, if the bone analysis was anything to go\nby.\nSometimes it is sheer opportunism that plays a part in the discovery of a new species. In\n1999. the National Geographic Society announced that the missing link between dinosaurs\nand modern birds had finally been found. Named Archaeoraptor lianoingensis. the fossil in\nquestion appeared to have the head and body of a bird, with the hind legs and tail of a 124-\nmillion-year-old dromaeosaur - a family of small theropods that include the bird-like\nVelociraptor made famous by Jurassic Park films.\nThere was a good reason why the fossil looked half-bird, half-dinosaur. CT scans almost\nimmediately proved the specimen was bogus and had been created by an industrious\nChinese farmer who had glued two separate fossils together to create a profitable hoax.\nBut while the palaeontologists behind the announcement were wiping egg off their faces,\nothers, including Xu were taking note. The head and body of the fake composite belonged\nto Yanornis martini, a primitive fish-eating bird from around 120 million years ago. The\ndromaeosaur tail and hind legs, however, were covered in what looked like fine proto\nfeathers. That fossil turned out to be something special. In 2000. Xu named it Microraptor\nand revealed that it had probably lived in the treetops. Although it couldn't fly. its curved\nclaws provided the first real evidence that dinosaurs could have climbed trees. Three years\nlater. Xu and his team discovered a closely related Microraptor species which changed\neverything. 'Microraptor had two salient features.' Xu explains, long feathers were attached\nnot just to its forearms but to its legs and claws. Then we noticed that these long feathers\nhad asymmetrical vanes, a feature often associated with flight capability. This meant that\nwe might have found a flying dinosaur.'\nSome extraordinary fossils have remained hidden in a collection and almost forgotten. For\nthe majority of the 20th century, the palaeontology community had ignored the frozen\ntundra of north Alaska. There was no way. scientists believed, that cold-blooded dinosaurs\ncould survive in such bleak, frigid conditions. But according to Alaskan dinosaur expert\n \n1\n\nTony Fiorillo. they eventually realised they were missing a trick.\nThe first discovery of dinosaurs in Alaska was actually made by a geologist called Robert\nLiscomb in 1961.' says Fiorillo. 'Unfortunately, Robert was killed in a rockslide the following\nyear, so his discoveries languished in a warehouse for the next two decades.' In the mid-\n1980s, managers at the warehouse stumbled upon the box containing Liscomb's fossils\nduring a spring clean. The bones were sent to the United States Geological Survey, where\nthey were identified as belonging to Edmontosaurus. a duck-billed hadrosaur. Today,\npalaeontologists roam this frozen treasure trove searching for remains locked away in the\npermafrost.\nThe rewards are worth the effort. While studying teeth belonging to the relatively intelligent\nTroodon therapod. Fiorillo discovered the teeth of the Alaskan Troodon were double the\nsize of those of its southern counterpart. 'Even though the morphology of individual teeth\nresembled that of Troodon. the size was significantly larger than the Troodon found in\nwarmer climates. Fiorillo says that the reason lies in the Troodon's large eyes, which\nallowed it to hunt at dawn and at dusk - times when other dinosaurs would have struggled\nto see. In the polar conditions of Cretaceous Alaska, where the Sun would all but disappear\nfor months on end, this proved a useful talent. Troodon adapted for life in the extraordinary\nlight regimes of the polar world. With this advantage, it took over as Alaska's dominant\ntherapod.' explains Fiorillo.\nFinding itself at the top of the food chain, the dinosaur evolved to giant proportions.\nIt is true that some of the most staggering of recent developments have come from\npalaeontologists being in the right place at the right time, but this is no reflection on their\nknowledge or expertise. After all, not everyone knows when they've stumbled upon\nsomething remarkable. When Argentine sheep farmer Guillermo Heredia uncovered what\nhe believed was a petrified tree Irunk on his Patagonian farm in 1988. he had no way of\nrealising that he'd found a 1.5-metre- long tibia of the largest sauropod ever known to walk\nthe Earth. Argenlinosaurus was 24 metres long and weighed 75 tonnes. The titanosaur was\nbrought to the attention of the scientific community in 1993 by Rodolfo Coria and Jose\nBonaparte of the National Museum of Natural Sciences in Buenos Aires. Coria points out\nthat most breakthroughs are not made by scientists, but by ordinary folk. 'But the real\nscientific discovery is not the finding; it's what we learn from that finding.' While any one of\nus can unearth a fossil, it takes dedicated scientists to see beyond the rock.\n \n2",
