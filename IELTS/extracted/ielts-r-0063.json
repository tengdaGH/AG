The site came to light only by chance. An agricultural worker, digging\nin the grounds of a derelict plantation, scraped open a grave – the first of dozens in a burial\nground some 3,000 years old. It is the oldest cemetery ever found in the Pacific islands,\nand it harbors the remains of an ancient people archaeologists call the Lapita.\n(2)\nThey were daring blue-water adventurers who used basic canoes to rove across the ocean.\nBut they were not just explorers. They were also pioneers who carried with them everything\nthey would need to build new lives – their livestock, taro seedlings and stone tools. Within\nthe span of several centuries, the Lapita stretched the boundaries of their world from the\njungle-clad volcanoes of Papua New Guinea to the loneliest coral outliers of Tonga.\n(3)\nThe Lapita left precious few clues about themselves, but Efate expands the volume of data\navailable  to researchers dramatically. The remains of 62 individuals have been uncovered\nso far, and  archaeologists were also thrilled to find six complete Lapita pots. Other items\nincluded a Lapita burial urn with modeled birds arranged on the rim as though peering\ndown at the human remains sealed inside. ‘It’s an important discovery,’ says Matthew\nSpriggs, professor of archaeology at the Australian National University and head of the\ninternational team digging up the site, ‘for it conclusively identifies the remains as Lapita.’\n(4)\nDNA teased from these human remains may help answer one of the most puzzling\nquestions in Pacific anthropology: did all Pacific islanders spring from one source or many?\nWas there only one outward migration from a single point in Asia, or several from different\npoints? ‘This represents the best opportunity we’ve had yet,’ says Spriggs, ‘to find out who\nthe Lapita actually were, where they came from, and who their closest descendants are\ntoday.’\n(5)\nThere is one stubborn question for which archaeology has yet to provide any answers: how\ndid the Lapita accomplish the ancient equivalent of a moon landing, many times over? No-\none has found one of their canoes or any rigging, which could reveal how the canoes were\nsailed. Nor do the oral histories and traditions of later Polynesians offer any insights, for\nthey turn into myths long before they reach as far back in time as the Lapita.\n(6)\n‘All we can say for certain is that the Lapita had canoes that were capable of ocean\nvoyages, and they had the ability to sail them,’ says Geoff Irwin, a professor of archaeology\n \n1\n\nat the University of Auckland. Those sailing skills, he says, were developed and passed\ndown over thousands of years by earlier mariners who worked their way through the\narchipelagoes of the western Pacific, making short crossings to nearby islands. The real\nadventure didn’t begin, however, until their Lapita descendants sailed out of sight of land,\nwith empty horizons on every side. This must have been as difficult for them as landing on\nthe moon is for us today. Certainly it distinguished them from their ancestors, but what\ngave them the courage to launch out on such risky voyages?\n(7)\nThe Lap it as thrust into the Pacific was eastward, against the prevailing trade winds, Irwin\nnotes. Those nagging headwinds, he argues, may have been the key to their success.\n‘They could sail out for days into the unknown and assess the area, secure in the\nknowledge that if they didn’t find anything, they could turn about and catch a swift ride back\non the trade winds. This is what would have made the whole thing work.’ Once out there,\nskilled seafarers would have detected abundant leads to follow to land: seabirds, coconuts\nand twigs carried out to sea by the tides, and the afternoon pile-up of clouds on the horizon\nwhich often indicates an island in the distance.\n(8)\nFor returning explorers, successful or not, the geography of their own archipelagoes would\nhave provided a safety net. Without this to go by, overshooting their home ports, getting\nlost and sailing off into eternity would have been all too easy. Vanuatu, for example,\nstretches more than 500 miles in a northwest-southeast trend, its scores of inrervisible\nislands forming a backstop for mariners riding the trade winds home.\n(9)\nAll this presupposes one essential detail, says Atholl Anderson, professor of prehistory at\nthe Australian National University: the Lapita had mastered the advanced art of sailing\nagainst the wind. ‘And there’s no proof they could do any such thing,’ Anderson says.\n‘There has been this assumption they did, and people have built canoes to re-create those\nearly voyages based on that assumption. But nobody has any idea what their canoes\nlooked like or how they were rigged.’\n(10)\nRather than give all the credit to human skill, Anderson invokes the winds of chance. El\nNino, the same climate disruption that affects the Pacific today, may have helped scatter\nthe Lapita, Anderson suggests. He points out that climate data obtained from slow-growing\ncorals around the Pacific indicate a series of unusually frequent El Ninos around the time of\nthe Lapita expansion. By reversing the regular east-to-west flow of the trade winds for\nweeks at a time, these super El Ninos might have taken the Lapita on long unplanned\nvoyages.\n(11)\nHowever they did it, the Lapita spread themselves a third of the way across the Pacific,\nthen called it quits for reasons known only to them. Ahead lay the vast emptiness of the\ncentral Pacific and perhaps they were too thinly stretched to venture farther. They probably\nnever numbered more than a few thousand in total, and in their rapid migration eastward\nthey encountered hundreds of islands – more than 300 in Fiji alone.\n \n2",
