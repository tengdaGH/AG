  "passage_text": "Reading Practice\n \nHistory of timekeeping\n \nEver since man first noticed the regular movement of the Sun and the stars, we have\nwondered about the passage of time. Prehistoric people first recorded the phases of the\nMoon some 30,000 years ago, and recording time has been a way by which humanity has\nobserved the heavens and represented the progress of civilization.\n \nThe earliest natural events to be recognized were in the heavens, but during the course of\nthe year, there were many other events that indicated significant changes in the\nenvironment. Seasonal winds and rains, the flooding of rivers, the flowering of trees and\nplants, and the breeding cycles or migration of animals and birds, all led to natural divisions\nof the year, and further observation and local customs led to the recognition of the\nseasons.\nEgyptian shadow clocks divided daytime into 12 parts with each part further divided into\nmore precise parts. One type of shadow clock consisted of a long stem with five variable\nmarks and an elevated crossbar which cast a shadow over those marks. It was positioned\neastward in the morning and was turned west at noon. Obelisks functioned in much the\nsame manner: the shadow cast on the markers around it allowed the Egyptians to calculate\nthe time. The obelisk also indicated whether it was morning or afternoon, as well as the\nsummer and winter solstices. 1500 BCE, was similar in shape to a bent T-square. It\nmeasured the passage of time by the shadow cast by its crossbar on a non-linear rule. The\nT was oriented eastward in the mornings and turned around at noon so that it could cast its\nshadow in the opposite direction. Although accurate, shadow clocks relied on the sun, and\nso were useless at night and in cloudy weather.\nInventions for measuring and regulating time\nThe early inventions were made to divide the day or the night into different periods in order\nto regulate work or ritual, so the lengths of the time periods varied greatly from place to\nplace and from one culture to another.\nOil lamps\nThere is archaeological evidence of oil lamps about 4,000 BCE, and the Chinese were\nusing oil for heating and lighting by 2,000 BCE. Oil lamps are still significant in religious\npractices, symbolic of the journey from darkness and ignorance to light and knowledge.\nThe shape of the lamp gradually evolved into the typical pottery style shown. It was\npossible to devise a way of measuring the level in the oil reservoir to measure the passing\nof time.\nCandle Clocks\nMarked candles were used for telling the time in China from the sixth century CE. There is\na popular story that King Alfred the Great invented the candle clock, but we know they were\nin use in England from the tenth century CE. However, the rate of burning is subject to\ndraughts, and the variable quality of the wax. Life oil lamps, candles were used to mark the\npassage of time from one event to another, rather than tell the time of day.\n \n1\n\nWater Clocks\nThe water clock, or clepsydra, appears to have been invented about 1,500 BCE and was a\ndevice which relied on the steady flow of water from or into a container. Measurements\ncould be marked on the container or on a receptacle for the water. In comparison with the\ncandle or the oil lamp, the clepsydra was more reliable, but the water flow still depended on\nthe variation of pressure from the head of water in the container.\nAstronomical and astrological clock making was developed in China from 200 to 1300 CE.\nEarly Chinese clepsydras drove various mechanisms illustrating astronomical phenomena.\nThe astronomer Su Sung and his associates built an elaborate clepsydra in 1088 CE. This\ndevice incorporated a water-driven bucket system originally invented about 725 CE. Among\nthe displays were a bronze power-driven rotating celestial globe, and manikins that rang\ngongs, and indicated special times of the day.\nHour Glasses or Sandglasses\nAs the technology of glass-blowing developed, from some time in the 14th century it\nbecame possible to make sandglasses. Originally, sandglasses were used as a measure\nfor periods of time like the lamps or candles, but as clocks became more accurate they\nwere used to calibrate sandglasses to measure specific periods of time, and to determine\nthe duration of sermons, university lectures, and even periods of torture.\nThe Division of the Day and the Length of the ‘Hour’ An Egyptian sundial from about 1,500\nBCE is the earliest evidence of the division of the day into equal parts, but the sundial was\nno use at night. The passage of time was extremely important for astronomers and priests\nwho were responsible for determining the exact hour for the daily rituals and for the\nimportant religious festivals, so a water clock was invented.\nThe Merkhet\nThe Egyptians improved upon the sundial with a ‘merkhet’, one of the oldest known\nastronomical instruments. It was developed around 600 BCE and uses a string with a\nweight as a plumb line to obtain a true vertical line, as in the picture. The other object is the\nrib of a palm leaf, stripped of its fronds and split at one end, making a thin slit for a sight.\n \nA pair of merkhets were used to establish a North-South direction by lining them up one\nbehind the other with the Pole Star. Viewing the plumb lines through the sight made sure\nthe two merkhets and the sight were in the same straight line with the Pole Star. This\nallowed for the measurement of night-time events with a water clock when certain stars\ncrossed the vertical plumb line (a ‘transit line’), and these events could then be recorded by\n‘night-time lines’ drawn on a sundial.\nThere are various theories about how the 24 hour day developed. The fact that the day was\ndivided into 12 hours might be because 12 is a factor of 60, and both the Babylonian and\nEgyptian civilisations recognised a zodiac cycle of 12 constellations. On the other hand,\n(excuse the pun) finger-counting with base 12 was a possibility. The fingers each have 3\njoints, and so counting on the joints gives one ‘full hand’ of 12.\nIn classical Greek and Roman times they used twelve hours from sunrise to sunset; but\nsince summer days and winter nights are longer than winter days and summer nights, the\nlengths of the hours varied throughout the year.\n \n2",
