  "passage_text": "Reading Practice\n \nDecision making and Happiness\n \nA\nAmericans today choose among more options in more parts of life than has ever been\npossible before. To an extent, the opportunity to choose enhances our lives. It is only\nlogical to think that if some choices are good, more is better; people who care about having\ninfinite options will benefit from them, and those who do not can always just ignore the 273\nversions of cereal they have never tried. Yet recent research strongly suggests that,\npsychologically, this assumption is wrong, with 5% lower percentage announcing they are\nhappy. Although some choices are undoubtedly better than none, more is not always better\nthan less.\n \nB\nRecent research offers insight into why many people end up unhappy rather than pleased\nwhen their options expand. We began by making a distinction between “maximizers” (those\nwho always aim to make the best possible choice) and “satisficers” (those who aim for\n“good enough,” whether or not better selections might be out there).\n \nC\nIn particular, we composed a set of statements—the Maximization Scale—to diagnose\npeople’s propensity to maximize. Then we had several thousand people rate themselves\nfrom 1 to 7 (from “completely disagree” to “completely agree”) on such statements as “I\nnever settle for second best.” We also evaluated their sense of satisfaction with their\ndecisions. We did not define a sharp cutoff to separate maximizers from satisficers, but in\ngeneral, we think of individuals whose average scores are higher than 4 (the scale’s\nmidpoint) as maxi- misers and those whose scores are lower than the midpoint as\nsatisficers. People who score highest on the test—the greatest maximizers—engage in\nmore product comparisons than the lowest scorers, both before and after they make\npurchasing decisions, and they take longer to decide what to buy. When satisficers find an\nitem that meets their standards, they stop looking. But maximizers exert enormous effort\nreading labels, checking out consumer magazines and trying new products. They also\nspend more time comparing their purchasing decisions with those of others.\n \nD\nWe found that the greatest maximizers are the least happy with the fruits of their efforts.\nWhen they compare themselves with others, they get little pleasure from finding out that\nthey did better and substantial dissatisfaction from finding out that they did worse. They are\nmore prone to experiencing regret after a purchase, and if their acquisition disappoints\nthem, their sense of well-being takes longer to recover. They also tend to brood or ruminate\nmore than satisficers do.\n \nE\nDoes it follow that maximizers are less happy in general than satisficers? We tested this by\nhaving people fill out a variety of questionnaires known to be reliable indicators of\nwellbeing. As might be expected, individuals with high maximization scores experienced\nless satisfaction with life and were less happy, less optimistic and more depressed than\n \n1\n\npeople with low maximization scores. Indeed, those with extreme maximization ratings had\ndepression scores that placed them in the borderline of clinical range.\n \nF\nSeveral factors explain why more choice is not always better than less, especially for\nmaximisers. High among these are “opportunity costs.” The quality of any given option\ncannot be assessed in isolation from its alternatives. One of the “costs” of making a\nselection is losing the opportunities that a different option would have afforded. Thus, an\nopportunity cost of vacationing on the beach in Cape Cod might be missing the fabulous\nrestaurants in the Napa Valley. Early Decision Making Research by Daniel Kahneman and\nAmos Tversky showed that people respond much more strongly to losses than gains. If we\nassume that opportunity costs reduce the overall desirability of the most preferred choice,\nthen the more alternatives there are, the deeper our sense of loss will be and the less\nsatisfaction we will derive from our ultimate decision.\n \nG\nThe problem of opportunity costs will be better for a satisficer. The latter’s “good enough”\nphilosophy can survive thoughts about opportunity costs. In addition, the “good enough”\nstandard leads to much less searching and inspection of alternatives than the maximizer’s\n“best” standard. With fewer choices under consideration, a person will have fewer\nopportunity costs to subtract.\n \nH\nJust as people feel sorrow about the opportunities they have forgone, they may also suffer\nregret about the option they settled on. My colleagues and I devised a scale to measure\nproneness to feeling regret, and we found that people with high sensitivity to regret are less\nhappy, less satisfied with life, less optimistic and more depressed than those with low\nsensitivity. Not surprisingly, we also found that people with high regret sensitivity tend to be\nmaximizers. Indeed, we think that worry over future regret is a major reason that individuals\nbecome maximizers. The only way to be sure you will not regret a decision is by making\nthe best possible one. Unfortunately, the more options you have and the more opportunity\ncosts you incur, the more likely you are to experience regret.\n I\nIn a classic demonstration of the power of sunk costs, people were offered season\nsubscriptions to a local theatre company. Some were offered the tickets at full price and\nothers at a discount. Then the researchers simply kept track of how often the ticket\npurchasers actually attended the plays over the course of the season. Full-price payers\nwere more likely to show up at performances than discount payers. The reason for this, the\ninvestigators argued, was that the full-price payers would experience more regret if they did\nnot use the tickets because not using the more costly tickets would constitute a bigger loss.\nTo increase sense of happiness, we can decide to restrict our options when the decision is\nnot crucial. For example, make a rule to visit no more than two stores when shopping for\nclothing.\n \n2",
