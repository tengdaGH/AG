  "passage_text": "Reading Practice\n \nEarly Childhood Education\nNew Zealand's National Party spokesman on education, Dr Lockwood Smith,\nrecently visited the US and Britain. Here he reports on the findings of his trip and\nwhat they could mean for New Zealand's education policy\nA\n‘Education To Be More' was published last August. It was the report of the New Zealand\nGovernment's Early Childhood Care and Education Working Group. The report argued for\nenhanced equity of access and better funding for childcare and early childhood education\ninstitutions. Unquestionably, that's a real need; but since parents don't normally send\nchildren to pre-schools until the age of three, are we missing out on the most important\nyears of all? \nB\nA 13 year study of early childhood development at Harvard University has shown that, by\nthe age of three, most children have the potential to understand about 1000 words - most\nof the language they will use in ordinary conversation for the rest of their lives.\nFurthermore, research has shown that while every child is born with a natural curiosity, if\ncan be suppressed dramatically during the second and third years of life. Researchers\nclaim that the human personality is formed during the first two years of life, and during the\nfirst three years children learn the basic skills they will use in all their later learning both at\nhome and at school. Once over the age of three, children continue to expand on existing\nknowledge of the world.\nC\nIt is generally acknowledged that young people from poorer socio-economic backgrounds\nfend to do less well in our education system. That's observed not just in New Zealand, but\nalso in Australia, Britain and America. In an attempt to overcome that educational under-\nachievement, a nationwide programme called 'Headstart' was launched in the United\nSlates in 1965. A lot of money was poured into it. It took children into pre-school institutions\nat the age of three and was supposed to help the children of poorer families succeed in\nschool.\nDespite substantial funding, results have been disappointing. It is thought that there are two\nexplanations for this. First, the programme began too late. Many children who entered it at\nthe age of three were already behind their peers in language and measurable intelligence.\nSecond, the parents were not involved. At the end of each day, 'Headstart' children\nreturned to the same disadvantaged home environment.\nD\nAs a result of the growing research evidence of the importance of the first three years of a\nchild's life and the disappointing results from 'Headstart', a pilot programme was launched\nin Missouri in the US that focused on parents as the child's first teachers. The 'Missouri'\nprogramme was predicated on research showing that working with the family, rather than\nbypassing the parents, is the most effective way of helping children get off to the best\n \n1\n\npossible start in life. The four-year pilot study included 380 families who were about to have\ntheir first child and who represented a cross-section of socio-economic status, age and\nfamily configurations. They included single-parent and two-parent families, families in which\nboth parents worked, and families with either the mother or father at home.\nThe programme involved trained parent- educators visiting the parents' home and working\nwith tire parent, or parents, and the child. Information on child development, and guidance\non things to look for and expect as the child grows were provided, plus guidance in\nfostering the child's intellectual, language, social and motor-skill development. Periodic\ncheck-ups of the child's educational and sensory development (hearing and vision) were\nmade to detect possible handicaps that interfere with growth and development. Medical\nproblems were referred to professionals.\nParent-educators made personal visits to homes and monthly group meetings were held\nwith other new parents to share experience and discuss topics of interest. Parent resource\ncentres, located in school buildings, offered learning materials for families and facilitators\nfor child core.\nE\nAt the age of three, the children who had been involved in the 'Missouri' programme were\nevaluated alongside a cross-section of children selected from the same range of socio-\neconomic backgrounds and family situations, and also a random sample of children that\nage. The results were phenomenal. By the age of three, the children in the programme\nwere significantly more advanced in language development than their peers, had made\ngreater strides in problem solving and other intellectual skills, and were further along in\nsocial development, tn fact, the average child on the programme was performing at the\nlevel of the top 15 to 20 per cent of their peers in such things as auditory comprehension,\nverbal ability and language ability.\nMost important of all, the traditional measures of 'risk', such as parents' age and education,\nor whether they were a single parent, bore little or no relationship to the measures of\nachievement and language development. Children in the programme performed equally\nwell regardless of socio-economic disadvantages. Child abuse was virtually eliminated. The\none factor that was found to affect the child's development was family stress leading to a\npoor quality of parent-child interaction. That interaction was not necessarily bad in poorer\nfamilies.\nF\nThese research findings are exciting. There is growing evidence in New Zealand that\nchildren from poorer socio-economic backgrounds are arriving at school less well\ndeveloped and that our school system tends to perpetuate that disadvantage. The initiative\noutlined above could break that cycle of disadvantage. The concept of working with parents\nin their homes, or at their place of work, contrasts quite markedly with the report of the\nEarly Childhood Care and Education Working Group. Their focus is on getting children and\nmothers access to childcare and institutionalised early childhood education. Education from\nthe age of three to five is undoubtedly vital, but without a similar focus on parent education\nand on the vital importance of the first three years, some evidence indicates that it will not\nbe enough to overcome educational inequity. \n \n2",
