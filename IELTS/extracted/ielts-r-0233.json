  "passage_text": "Reading Practice\n \nIssues Affecting the Southern Resident Orcas\nA\nOrcas, also known as killer whales, are opportunistic feeders, which means they will take a\nvariety of different prey species. J, K, and L pods (specific groups of orcas found in the\nregion) are almost exclusively fish eaters. Some studies show that up to 90 percent of their\ndiet is salmon, with Chinook salmon being far and away their favorite. During the last 50\nyears, hundreds of wild runs of salmon have become extinct due to habitat loss and\noverfishing of wild stocks. Many of the extinct salmon stocks are the winter runs of chinook\nand coho. Although the surviving stocks have probably been sufficient to sustain the\nresident pods, many of the runs that have been lost were undoubtedly traditional resources\nfavored by the resident orcas. This may be affecting the whales’ nutrition in the winter and\nmay require them to change their patterns of movement in order to search for food.\nOther studies with tagged whales have shown that they regularly dive up to 800 feet in this\narea.\nResearchers tend to think that during these deep dives the whales may be feeding on\nbottomfish. Bottomfish species in this area would include halibut, rockfish, lingcod, and\ngreenling. Scientists estimate that today’s lingcod population in northern Puget Sound and\nthe Strait of Georgia is only 2 percent of what it was in 1950. The average size of rockfish\nin the recreational catch has also declined by several inches since the 1970s, which is\nindicative of overfishing. In some locations, certain rockfish species have disappeared\nentirely. So even if bottomfish are not a major food resource for the whales, the present low\nnumbers of available fish increases the pressure on orcas and all marine animals to find\nfood. (For more information on bottomfish see the San Juan County Bottomfish Recovery\nProgram.)\n  \nB\nToxic substances accumulate in higher concentrations as they move up the food chain.\nBecause orcas t are the top predator in the ocean and are at the top of several different\nfood chains in the environment, they tend to be more affected by pollutants than other sea\ncreatures. Examinations of stranded killer whales have shown some extremely high levels\nof lead, mercury, and polychlorinated hydrocarbons. Abandoned marine toxic waste dumps\nand present levels of industrial and human refuse pollution of the inland waters probably\npresents the most serious threat to the continued existence of this orca population.\nUnfortunately, the total remedy to this huge problem would be broad societal changes on\nmany fronts. But because of the fact that orcas are so popular, they may be the best\nspecies to use as a focal point in bringing about the many changes that need to be made in\norder to protect the marine environment as a whole from further toxic poisoning.'\nC\nThe waters around the San Juan Islands are extremely busy due to international\ncommercial shipping, fishing, whale watching, and pleasure boating. On a busy weekend\nday in the summer, it is not uncommon to see numerous boats in the vicinity of the whales\nas they travel through the area. The potential impacts from all this vessel traffic with regard\nto the whales and other marine animals in the area could be tremendous.\n \n1\n\nThe surfacing and breathing space of marine birds and mammals is a critical aspect of their\nhabitat, which the animals must consciously deal with on a moment-to-moment basis\nthroughout their lifetimes. With all the boating activity in the vicinity, there are three ways in\nwhich surface impacts are most likely to affect marine animals: (a) collision, (b) collision\navoidance, and (c) exhaust emissions in breathing pockets.\nThe first two impacts are very obvious and don’t just apply to vessels with motors.\nKayakers even present a problem here because they’re so quiet. Marine animals, busy\nhunting and feeding under the surface of the water, may not be aware that there is a kayak\nabove them and actually hit the bottom of it as they surface to breathe.\nThe third impact is one most people don’t even think of. When there are numerous boats in\nthe area, especially idling boats, there are a lot of exhaust fumes being spewed out on the\nsurface of the water. When the whale comes up to take a nice big breath of “fresh\" air, it\ninstead gets a nice big breath of exhaust fumes. It’s hard to say how greatly this affects the\nanimals, but think how breathing polluted air affects us (i.e., smog in large cities like Los\nAngeles, breathing the foul air while sitting in traffic jams, etc)._\nD\nSimilar to surface impacts, a primary source of acoustic pollution for this population of\norcas would also be derived from the cumulative underwater noise of vessel traffic. For\ncetaceans, the underwater sound environment is perhaps the most critical component of\ntheir sensory and behavioral lives. Orcas communicate with each other over short and long\ndistances with a variety of clicks, chirps, squeaks, and whistles, along with using\necholocation to locate prey and to navigate. They may also rely on passive listening as a\nprimary sensory source. The long-term impacts from noise pollution would not likely show\nup as noticeable behavioral changes in habitat use, but rather as sensory damage or\ngradual reduction in population health. A new study at The Whale Museum called the\nSeaSound Remote Sensing Network has begun studying underwater acoustics and its\nrelationship to orca communication.\n \n2",
