The results of a 14-year study to be announced later this month reveal that\nthe diseases associated with old age are afflicting fewer and fewer people and when they\ndo strike, it is much later in life.\nIn the last 14 years, the National Long-term Health Care Survey has gathered data on the\nhealth and lifestyles of more than 20,000 men and women over 65. Researchers,\nnow analysing the results of data gathered in 1994, say arthritis, high blood pressure\nand circulation problems - the major medical complaints in this age group - are troubling\na smaller proportion every year. And the data confirms that the rate at which these\ndiseases are declining continues to accelerate. Other diseases of old age - dementia,\nstroke, arteriosclerosis and emphysema - are also troubling fewer and fewer people.\n'It really raises the question of what should be considered normal ageing,' says Kenneth\nManton, a demographer from Duke University in North Carolina. He says the\nproblems doctors accepted as normal in a 65-year-old in 1982 are often not appearing until\npeople are 70 or 75.\nClearly, certain diseases are beating a retreat in the face of medical advances. But there\nmay be other contributing factors. Improvements in childhood nutrition in the first quarter\nof the twentieth century, for example, gave today's elderly people a better start in life\nthan their predecessors.\nOn the downside, the data also reveals failures in public health that have caused surges in\nsome illnesses. An increase in some cancers and bronchitis may reflect changing\nsmoking habits and poorer air quality, say the researchers. 'These may be subtle\ninfluences,' says Manton, 'but our subjects have been exposed to worse and worse\npollution for over 60 years. It's not surprising we see some effect.'\nOne interesting correlation Manton uncovered is that better-educated people are likely to\nlive longer. For example, 65-year-old women with fewer than eight years of schooling\nare expected, on average, to live to 82. Those who continued their education live an extra\nseven years. Although some of this can be attributed to a higher income, Manton believes it\nis mainly because educated people seek more medical attention.\nThe survey also assessed how independent people over 65 were, and again found a\nstriking trend. Almost 80% of those in the 1994 survey could complete everyday activities\nranging from eating and dressing unaided to complex tasks such as cooking and managing\ntheir finances. That represents a significant drop in the number of disabled old people in\nthe population. If the trends apparent in the United States 14 years ago had continued,\nresearchers calculate there would be an additional one million disabled elderly people in\ntoday's population. According to Manton, slowing the trend has saved the United\nStates government's Medicare system more than $200 billion, suggesting that the greying\nof America's population may prove less of a financial burden than expected.\nThe increasing self-reliance of many elderly people is probably linked to a massive\nincrease in the use of simple home medical aids. For instance, the use of raised toilet seats\nhas more than doubled since the start of the study, and the use of bath seats has grown by\n \n1\n\nmore than 50%. These developments also bring some health benefits, according to a\nreport from the MacArthur Foundation's research group on successful ageing. The group\nfound that those elderly people who were able to retain a sense of independence were\nmore likely to stay healthy in old age.\nMaintaining a level of daily physical activity may help mental functioning, says Carl\nCotman, a neuroscientist at the University of California at Irvine. He found that rats that\nexercise on a treadmill have raised levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor coursing\nthrough their brains. Cotman believes this hormone, which keeps neurons functioning, may\nprevent the brains of active humans from deteriorating.\nAs part of the same study, Teresa Seeman, a social epidemiologist at the University of\nSouthern California in Los Angeles, found a connection between self-esteem and stress\nin people over 70. In laboratory simulations of challenging activities such as driving, those\nwho felt in control of their lives pumped out lower levels of stress hormones such as\ncortisol. Chronically high levels of these hormones have been linked to heart disease.\nBut independence can have drawbacks. Seeman found that elderly people who felt\nemotionally isolated maintained higher levels of stress hormones even when asleep.\nThe research suggests that older people fare best when they feel independent but know\nthey can get help when they need it.\n'Like much research into ageing, these results support common sense,' says Seeman.\nThey also show that we may be underestimating the impact of these simple factors. 'The\nsort of thing that your grandmother always told you turns out to be right on target,' she\nsays.\n \n2",
