  "passage_text": "Reading Practice\n \nThe Rise and Fall of the British Textile Industry\nTextile production in Britain can be said to have its roots as an industry at the beginning of\nthe 18th century, when Thomas Crotchet and George Sorocold established what is thought\nto be the first factory built in Britain. It was a textile mill with a waterwheel as its source of\npower, the latest machinery, and even accommodation for the workers. As well as possibly\nbeing the first sweatshop in the modern sense, it was the beginning of the end for\ntraditional textile production.\nFor hundreds of years the spinning and weaving of cloth had been done manually by men,\nwomen and children in their own homes.The yarn would be combed and spun using a\nspindle, then woven on a hand loom, and what they produced would be mainly for local\nconsumption.Technology far more sophisticated than the spindle and hand-loom would\nchange all that.\nThe demand for cotton textiles had been growing since the Middle Ages, fostered by the\nimportation of high quality cotton fabrics from the Middle East and India. So how were local\nproducers to fight off the com petition? The imported fabrics were of course expensive, so\ntextile makers (not just in Britain but throughout Europe) produced mixed fabrics and cotton\nsubstitutes.They also had foreign textiles banned. But the key to the increased productivity\nneeded to meet the demand, was machine production. It would be faster, cheaper and the\nfinished products would be consistent in quality. Not least of the advantages was that it\nwould allow manufacturers to market their goods on a large, if not yet global, scale.\nThe story of the growth of the British textile industry from about 1733 and for the next two\nhundred years is one of constant technological innovation and expansion. In 1733 John\nKay invented the fly-shuttle, which made the hand-loom more efficient, and in 1764 James\nHargreaves came up with the spinning jenny, which among other things had the effect of\nraising productivity eightfold. The next great innovator was Richard Arkwright, who in 1768\nemployed John Kay (of the fly-shuttle) to help him build more efficient machinery. He was a\nman with a vision – to mechanise textile production – and by 1782 he had a network of\nmills across Britain. As the water-powered machinery, though not yet fully mechanised,\nbecame more complex, Kay began to use steam engines for power. The first power-loom,\nhowever, which was invented in 1785 by Dr Edmund Cartwright, really did mechanise the\nweaving stage of textile manufacture.\nThe pace of growth quickened with the expansion of Britain’s influence in the world and the\nacquisition of colonies from which cheap raw materials could be imported. For example, in\na single decade, from 1781 to 1791, imports of cotton into Britain quadrupled, going on to\nreach 100 million pounds in weight in 1815 and 263 million in 1830.The increase in exports\nis equally impressive; in 1751 £46,000 worth of cloth was exported and by the end of the\ncentury this had risen to £5.4 million. By the end of the 19th century the figure had soared\nto close on £50 million. Britain was now supplying cheaper and better quality clothing to a\nglobal market. Yet during the course of the 20th century Britain lost its position as a major\ntextile manufacturer.\nSo what happened? There are a number of views on this question, not all of them\nconflicting, and where there is disagreement it is usually about when the decline began.\nWhether it began before the First World War (1914-18), or during the inter-war years\n(1919—1939), or after 1945, most economists would give roughly the same reasons. To\n \n1\n\nstart with, there was competition from abroad, especially from developing countries in the\nFar East, notably Japan. It was thought by manufacturers that the best way to combat this\nincreased competition was to modernise. However, management and the labour unions\nwere unable to agree on how to handle this situation.\nModernisation would mean people losing their jobs and possibly a change in labour\npractices. Such changes as were made served only to slow down the industry’s decline\nrather than help regain its predominant position. Economically less developed countries, on\nthe other hand, had the advantage of being able to provide low wage competition, without\nthe problem of powerful labour unions.\nThere are, of course, many other reasons for the textile industry’s decline, two of which\nbecame particularly noticeable in the late twentieth century and are related. The first is\noutsourcing, when manufacturers establish factories in countries where there is cheap\nlabour. This obviously leads to less demand for locally-produced goods. Related to this, the\ntextile and clothing industries have acquired a bad reputation for exploiting workers, often\nillegal immigrants, in sweatshops where they are forced to work long hours and are paid far\nless than the minimum wage.\n                    \nWe seem to be back with Crotchet and Sorocold and their first live-in factory. The\nglobalising trend of out-sourcing, however, was a rational response to the growing\ncompetition from overseas, which, it goes without saying, does not excuse the exploitation\nof workers. The British industry itself, while no longer holding a key place in the global\ntextile market has adapted itself and now concentrates more on the world of fashion and\ndesign, where it seems to be doing quite well.\n \n2",
