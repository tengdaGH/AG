  "passage_text": "Reading Practice\n \n \nOrientation of birds\n \nA For many of US, the way birds are able to orientate is both astounding and difficult to\nappreciate fully. For instance, the annual migration of tire golden plover of the Pacific takes\nit from Alaska to Hawaii on a flight of well over 3000 kilometres, and if it were to deviate by\nonly one degree, it would miss the island on which it nests.\n \nB The first systematic studies on orientation in birds were made possible by the ‘homing\ninstinct’ exhibited by so many species. Birds are caught at a time when they show an\nattachment to their territory, especially during the nesting season. They are taken to some\nspot, released, and the percentage of returns is recorded. The distance can be varied, and\nthe direction, as well as the method of transporting them, and then the influence of climatic\nand other factors on their ability to find their way home can be studied. These experiments\nhave shown a wide variation in ability to home, and three types of homing behaviour have\nbeen identified.\n \nC In the first type, birds methodically explore the area in which they are released until they\npick up some familiar feature, and then they quickly find their way back to the nest. Such\nbirds possess a highly developed visual memory, as experiments with pigeons have\nshown. Domestic pigeons have been trained to peck at a certain point on an aerial\nphotograph, with a system of rewards, and four years later the birds were still able to\nrespond to this training when placed on the aerial photograph. Birds’ eyes have a power of\nresolution two to three times greater than ours, enabling them to pick up very fine details. If\na bird uses only this type of homing behaviour, however, it can only succeed if the point of\nrelease is not too far away. If the birds are transported 800 kilometres from their nest, it is\nonly by good fortune that they find their way back as a result of long exploratory flights.\nUsually, the area known to a bird is its feeding territory. Released within this area, the birds\nsoon make their return; release them outside it and far fewer return. However, if a bird is\nreleased for a second time in the same place, its visual memory comes into play, and the\nbird, no longer requiring tedious exploratory flights, will return much more quickly.\n \nD The second type of homing behaviour is shown by birds that are capable of choosing\ntheir flight direction and holding to it for the rest of their journey. How do they decide what\ndirection to take? They appear to choose their normal migration direction even if they are\nreleased in a different place from their usual stalling point. If, for example, birds which\nnormally fly to the north-east to reach latitude 45 degrees north are released at that\nlatitude, they will immediately start flying north-east anyway. So if they’re released further\nto the west, they’ll maintain the correct direction, but fly west of their destination, and so fail\nto arrive.\n \nE The third type of homing behaviour shows the highest degree of orientation. Released at\none point, the birds immediately take stock of it, compare its position with that of the nest,\ndecide on the direction and fly off. This happens even if the birds are in a country right off\ntheir migration routes, where they have never been before. In one example, a laysan\nalbatross returned to its nesting area on Midway Island in the middle of the Pacific, having\nflown over 5000 kilometres from the west coastal of the USA in just over ten days. This is a\nperfect example of the third type of homing, for the albatross clearly couldn’t rely on any\nlandmarks over the vast expanse of the Pacific Ocean.\nF The percentage of successful birds varies greatly, being highest in those species with a\n \n1\n\n \nstrong migratory behaviour. Thus the lesser black-backed gull is more migratory than the\nherring gull and more often reaches ‘home’. Great migrants such as the swift have the\nhighest percentage of returns. In one case, seven out of nine alpine swifts were recaptured\nat their nests after being displaced some 1400 kilometres; one made the journey in three\ndays.\n \nG What part does heredity play in all this? Two research studies suggest that instinctive,\ni.e. genetically inherited, behaviour patterns play a part in navigation. The first was carried\nout by Ernst Schuz and it is highly significant. Schuz caught first year European storks and\nreleased them later, after the departure of the adult storks at a time when they normally\nmake their south-west autumn migration to Africa. The recaptures showed that, in spite of\nthefact that there were no adults to guide them, the birds unanimously headed south-west.\nThis was a most striking finding, for it showed that the birds had an innate and unlearned\nattraction for the African wintering area that they have occupied for thousands of years.\nH The case of starlings is a little different. These birds have a great aptitude for homing, but\nthis behaviour differs in the different age groups. Birds that were shifted to the south-east of\ntheir normal migration route split into two lots. The adults, in full possession of their gift for\norientation, found their wintering area by modifying their direction by 90 degrees, whereas\nthe juveniles sought their winter quarters to the south-east of their real position.\n \n2",
