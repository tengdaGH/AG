Australian sports teams win more\nthan their fair share of titles, demolishing rivals with seeming ease. How do they do it? A\nbig part of the secret is an extensive and expensive network of sporting academies\nunderpinned by science and medicine. At the Australian Institute of Sport (AIS), hundreds\nof youngsters and pros live and train under the eyes of coaches. Another body, the\nAustralian Sports Commission (ASC), finances programmes of excellence in a total of 96\nsports for thousands of sportsmen and women. Both provide intensive coaching, training\nfacilities and nutritional advice.\nB\nInside the academies, science takes centre stage.The AIS employs more than 100 sports\nscientists and doctors, and collaborates with scores of others in universities and\nresearch centres. AIS scientists work across a number of sports, applying skills learned in\none - such as building muscle strength in golfers - to others, such as swimming and\nsquash.They are backed up by technicians who design instruments to collect data from\nathletes.They all focus on one aim: winning.‘We can’t waste our time looking at ethereal\nscientific questions that don’t help the coach work with an athlete and improve\nperformance,’ says Peter Pricker chief of science at AIS.\nC\nA lot of their work comes down to measurement - everything from the exact angle of a\nswimmer’s dive to the second-by-second power output of a cydist.This data is used to\nwring improvements out of athletes.The focus is on individuals, tweaking performances to\nsqueeze an extra hundredth of a second here, an extra millimetre there. No gain is too\nslight to bother with. It's the tiny, gradual improvements that add up to world-beating\nresults.To demonstrate how the system works, Bruce Mason at AIS shows off the prototype\nof a 3D analysis tool for studying swimmers. A wire-frame model of a champion swimmer\nslices through the water, her arms moving in slow motion. Looking side-on, Mason\nmeasures the distance between strokes. From above, he analyses how her spine swivels.\nWhen fully developed, this system will enable him to build a biomechanical profile for\ncoaches to use to help budding swimmers. Mason's contribution to sport also includes the\ndevelopment of the SWAN (SWimming ANalysis) system now used in Australian national\ncompetitions. It collects images from digital cameras running at 50 frames a second and\nbreaks down each part of a swimmer's performance into factors that can be analysed\nindividually - stroke length, stroke frequency, average duration of each stroke, velocity,\nstart, lap and finish times, and so on. At the end of each race, SWAN spits out data on\neach swimmer.\nD \nTake a look,' says Mason, pulling out a sheet of data. He points out the data on the\nswimmers in second and third place, which shows that the one who finished third actually\nswam faster. So why did he finish 35 hundredths of a second down? ‘His turn times were\n44 hundredths of a second behind the other guy,’ says Mason.‘If he can improve on his\n \n1\n\nturns, he can do much better.'This is the kind of accuracy that AIS scientists’ research is\nbringing to a range of sports. With the Cooperative Research Centre for Micro Technology\nin Melbourne, they are developing unobtrusive sensors that will be embedded in an\nathlete's clothes or running shoes to monitor heart rate, sweating, heat production or any\nother factor that might have an impact on an athlete's ability to run.There's more to it than\nsimply measuring performance. Pricker gives the example of athletes who may be down\nwith coughs and colds II or 12 times a year. After years of experimentation, AIS and the\nUniversity of Newcastle in New South Wales developed a test that measures how much of\nthe immune-system protein immunoglobulin A is present in athletes' saliva. If lgA levels\nsuddenly fall below a certain level, training is eased or dropped altogether. Soon, lgA levels\nstart rising again, and the danger passes. Since the tests were introduced, AIS athletes in\nall sports have been remarkably successful at staying healthy.\nE\nUsing data is a complex business. Well before a championship, sports scientists and\ncoaches start to prepare the athlete by developing a ‘competition model', based on what\nthey expect will be the winning times.'You design the model to make that time,' says\nMason.'A start of this much, each free-swimming period has to be this fast, with a certain\nstroke frequency and stroke length, with turns done in these times.'All the training is then\ngeared towards making the athlete hit those targets, both overall and for each segment of\nthe race.Techniques like these have transformed Australia into arguably the world's most\nsuccessful sporting nation.\nF\nOf course, there's nothing to stop other countries copying - and many have tried. Some\nyears ago, the AIS unveiled coolant-lined jackets for endurance athletes. At the Atlanta\nOlympic Games in 1996, these sliced as much as two per cent off cyclists' and rowers’\ntimes. Now everyone uses them.The same has happened to the 'altitude tent', developed\nby AIS to replicate the effect of altitude training at sea level. But Australia's success story is\nabout more than easily copied technological fixes, and up to now no nation has replicated\nits all-encompassing system.\n \n2",
