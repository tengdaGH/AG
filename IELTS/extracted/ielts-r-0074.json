  "passage_text": "Reading Practice\n \nBook review on Musicophilia\nNorman M. Weinberger reviews the latest work of Oliver Sacks on music.\nA\nMusic and the brain are both endlessly fascinating subjects, and as a neuroscientist\nspecialising in auditory learning and memory, I find them especially intriguing. So I had high\nexpectations of Musicophilia, the latest offering from neurologist and prolific author Oliver\nSacks. And I confess to feeling a little guilty reporting that my reactions to the book are\nmixed.\nB\nSacks himself is the best part of Musicophilia. He richly documents his own life in the book\nand reveals highly personal experiences. The photograph of him on the cover of the book-\nwhich shows him wearing headphones, eyes closed, clearly enchanted as he listens to\nAlfred Brendel perform Beethoven’s Pathetique Sonata-makes a positive impression that is\nborne out by the contents of the book. Sacks’ voice throughout is steady and erudite but\nnever pontifical. He is neither self-conscious nor self-promoting.\nC\nThe preface gives a good idea of what the book will deliver. In it, Sacks explains that he\nwants to convey the insights gleaned from the “enormous and rapidly growing body of work\non the neural underpinnings of musical perception and imagery, and the complex and often\nbizarre disorders to which these are prone.” He also stresses the importance of “the simple\nart of observation” and “the richness of the human context.” He wants to combine\n“observation and description with the latest in technology,” he says, and to imaginatively\nenter into the experience of his patients and subjects. The reader can see that Sacks, who\nhas been practicing neurology for 40 years, is torn between the “old-fashioned” path of\nobservation and the new-fangled, high-tech approach: He knows that he needs to take\nheed of the latter, but his heart lies with the former.\nD\nThe book consists mainly of detailed descriptions of cases, most of them involving patients\nwhom Sacks has seen in his practice. Brief discussions of contemporary neuroscientific\nreports are sprinkled liberally throughout the text. Part, “Haunted by Music,” begins with the\nstrange case of Tony Cicoria, a nonmusical, middle-aged surgeon who was consumed by a\nlove of music after being hit by lightning. He suddenly began to crave listening to piano\nmusic, which he had never cared for in the past. He started to play the piano and then to\ncompose music, which arose spontaneously in his mind in a “torrent” of notes. How could\nthis happen? Was the cause psychological? (He had had a near-death experience when\nthe lightning struck him.) Or was it the direct result of a change in the auditory regions of\nhis cerebral cortex? Electroencephalography (EEG) showed his brain waves to be normal\nin the mid-1990s, just after his trauma and subsequent “conversion” to music. There are\nnow more sensitive tests, but Cicoria, has declined to undergo them; he does not want to\ndelve into the causes of his musicality. What a shame!\nE\n \n1\n\nPart II, “A Range of Musicality,” covers a wider variety of topics, but unfortunately, some of\nthe chapters offer little or nothing that is new. For example, chapter 13, which is five pages\nlong, merely notes that the blind often has better hearing than the sighted. The most\ninteresting chapters are those that present the strangest cases. Chapter 8 is about\n“amusia,” an inability to hear sounds like music, and “dysharmonia,” a highly specific\nimpairment of the ability to hear harmony, with the ability to understand melody left intact.\nSuch specific “dissociations” are found throughout the cases Sacks recounts.\nF\nTo Sacks’s credit, part III, “Memory, Movement and Music,” brings us into the\nunderappreciated realm of music therapy. Chapter 16 explains how “melodic intonation\ntherapy” is being used to help expressive aphasic patients (those unable to express their\nthoughts verbally following a stroke or other cerebral incident) once again become capable\nof fluent speech. In chapter 20, Sacks demonstrates the near-miraculous power of music to\nanimate Parkinson’s patients and other people with severe movement disorders, even\nthose who are frozen into odd postures. Scientists cannot yet explain how music achieves\nthis effect\nG\nTo readers who are unfamiliar with neuroscience and music behavior, Musicophilia may be\nsomething of a revelation. But the book will not satisfy those seeking the causes and\nimplications of the phenomena Sacks describes. For one thing, Sacks appears to be more\nat ease discussing patients than discussing experiments. And he tends to be rather\nuncritical in accepting scientific findings and theories.\nH\nIt’s true that the causes of music-brain oddities remain poorly understood. However, Sacks\ncould have done more to draw out some of the implications of the careful observations that\nhe and other neurologists have made and of the treatments that have been successful. For\nexample, he might have noted that the many specific dissociations among components of\nmusic comprehension, such as loss of the ability to perceive harmony but not melody,\nindicate that there is no music center in the brain. Because many people who read the\nbook are likely to believe in the brain localisation of all mental functions, this was a missed\neducational opportunity.\nI\nAnother conclusion one could draw is that there seem to be no “cures” for neurological\nproblems involving music. A drug can alleviate a symptom in one patient and aggravate it\nin another or can have both positive and negative effects in the same patient. Treatments\nmentioned seem to be almost exclusively antiepileptic medications, which “damp down” the\nexcitability of the brain in general; their effectiveness varies widely.\nJ\nFinally, in many of the cases described here the patient with music-brain symptoms is\nreported to have “normal” EEG results. Although Sacks recognises the existence of new\ntechnologies, among them far more sensitive ways to analyze brain waves than the\nstandard neurological EEG test, he does not call for their use. In fact, although he exhibits\nthe greatest compassion for patients, he conveys no sense of urgency about the pursuit of\n \n2\n\nnew avenues in the diagnosis and treatment of music-brain disorders. This absence\nechoes the book’s preface, in which Sacks expresses fear that “the simple art of\nobservation may be lost” if we rely too much on new technologies. He does call for both\napproaches, though, and we can only hope that the neurological community will respond.\n \n3",
