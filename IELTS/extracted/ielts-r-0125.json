  "passage_text": "Reading Practice\n \nDensity and Crowding\nA. Of the great myriad of problems which man and the world face today, there are three\nsignificant fiends which stand above all others in importance: the uprecedented population\ngrowth throughout the world a net increase of 1,400,000 people per week and all of its\nassociations and consequences; the increasing urbanization of these people, so that more\nand more of them are rushing into cities and urban areas of the world; and the tremendous\nexplosion of communication and social contact throughout the world, so that every part of\nthe world is now aware of every other part. All of these fiends are producing increased\ncrowding and the perception of crowding.\nB. It is important to emphasize at the outset that crowding and density are not necessarily\nthe same. Density is the number of individuals per unit area or unit space. It is a simple\nphysical measurement. Crowding is a product of density, communication, contact, and\nactivity. It implies a pressure, a force, and a psychological reaction. It may occur at widely\ndifferent densities.\n \nThe frontiersman may have felt crowded when someone built a homestead a mile away.\nThe suburbanite may feel relatively uncrowded in a small house on a half-acre lot if it is\nsurrounded by trees, bushes, and a hedgerow, even though he lives under much higher\nphysical density than did the frontiersman. Hence, crowding is very much a psychological\nand ecological phenomenon, and not just a physical condition.\n \nC. A classic crowding study was done by Calhoun (1962), who put rats into a physical\nenvironment designed to accommodate 50 rats and provided enough food, water, and\nnesting materials for the number of rats in the environment. The rat population peaked at\n80, providing a look at ramped living conditions. Although the rats experienced no resource\nlimitations other than space restriction, a number of negative conditions developed: the two\nmost dominant males took harems of several female rats and occupied more than their\nshare of space, leaving other rats even more crowded; many females stopped building\nnests and abandoned their infant rats; the pregnancy rate declined; infant and adult\nmortality rates increased; more aggressive and physical attacks occurred; sexual variation\nincreased, including hypersexuality, inhibited sexuality, homosexuality, and bisexuality.\nD. Calhoun’s results have led to other research on crowding’s effects on human beings,\nand these research findings have suggested that high density is not the single cause of\nnegative effects on humans. When crowding is defined only in terms of spatial density (the\namount of space per person), the effects of crowding are variable. However, if crowding is\ndefined in terms of social density, or the number of people who must interact, then\ncrowding better predicts negative psychological and physical effects.\nE. There are several reasons why crowding makes US feel uncomfortable. One reason is\nrelated to stimulus overload there are just too many stimuli competing for our attention. We\n \n1\n\ncannot notice or respond to all of them. This feeling is typical of the harried mother, who\nhas several children competing for her attention, while she is on the phone and the doorbell\nis ringing. This leaves her feeling confused, fatigued and yearning to withdraw from the\nsituation. There are strong feelings of a lack of privacy – being unable to pay attention to\nwhat you want without being repeatedly interrupted or observed by others.\nF. Field studies done in a variety of settings illustrate that social density is associated with\nnegative effects on human beings. In prison studies, males generally became more\naggressive with increases in density. In male prison, inmate; living in conditions of higher\ndensities were more likely to suffer from fight. Males rated themselves as more aggressive\nin small rooms (a situation of high spatial density), whilst the females rated themselves as\nmore aggressive in large rooms (Stokols et al., 1973). These differences relate to the\ndifferent personal space requirements of the genders.\n \nBesides, Baum and Greenberg found that high density leads to decreased attraction, both\nphysical attraction and liking towards others and it appears to have gender differences in\nthe impact that density has on attraction levels, with males experiencing a more extreme\nreaction. Also, the greater the density is, the less the helping behavior. One reason why the\nlevel of helping behavior may be reduced in crowded situations links to the concept of\ndiffusion of responsibility. The more people that are present in a situation that requires\nhelp, the less often help is given. This may be due to the fact that people diffuse\nresponsibility among themselves with no-one feeling that they ought to be the one to help.\nG. Facing all these problems, what are we going to do with them? The more control a\nperson has over the crowded environment the less negatively they experience it, thus the\nperceived crowding is less (Schmidt and Keating). The ability to cope with crowding is also\ninfluenced by the relationship the individual has with the other people in the situation. The\nhigh density will be interpreted less negatively if the individual experiences it with people he\nlikes. One of the main coping strategies employed to limit the impact of high density is\nsocial withdrawal. This includes behaviors such as averting the gaze and using negative\nbody language to attempt to block any potential intrusions.\n \n2",
