  "passage_text": "Reading Practice\n \nAqua Product: New zealand ‘s Algae Biodiesel\nA\nThe world’s first wild algae biodiesel, produced in New Zealand by Aquaflow Bionomic\nCorporation, was successfully test-driven in Wellington by the Minister for Energy and\nClimate Change Issues, David Parker. In front of a crowd of invited guests, media and\nmembers of the public, the Minister filled up a diesel-powered Land Rover with Aquaflow\nB5 blend bio-diesel and then drove the car around the forecourt of Parliament Buildings in\nCentral Wellington. Green Party co-leader, Jeanette Fitzsimons was also on board.\nMarlborough-based Aquaflow announced on May 2006 that it had produced the world’s first\nbio-diesel derived from wild microalgae sourced from local sewage ponds.\nB\n“We believe we are the first company in the world to test drive a car powered by wild algae-\nbased biodiesel. This will come as a surprise to some international bio-diesel industry\npeople who believe that this break-through is still years away,” explains Aquaflow\nspokesperson Barrie Leay. “A bunch of inventive Kiwis and an Aussie have developed this\nfuel in just over a year”, he comments. “This is a huge opportunity for New Zealand and a\ngreat credit to the team of people who saw the potential in this technology from day one.”\nC\nBio-diesel based on algae could eventually become a sustainable, low cost, cleaner-\nburning fuel alternative for New Zealand, powering family cars, trucks, buses and boats. It\ncan also be used for other purposes such as heating or distributed electricity generation.\nThere is now a global demand for billions of litres of biodiesel per year. Algae are also\nreadily available and produced in huge volumes in nutrient-rich waste streams such as at\nthe settling ponds of Effluent Management Systems (EMS). It is a renewable indigenous\nresource ideally suited to the production of fuel and other useful by-products. The\nbreakthrough comes after technology start-up, Aquaflow, agreed to undertake a pilot with\nMarlborough District Council late last year to extract algae from the settling ponds of its\nEMS based in Blenheim. By removing the main contaminant to use as a fuel feedstock,\nAquaflow is also helping clean up the council’s water discharge – a process known as bio-\nremediation. Dairy farmers, and many food processors too, can benefit in similar ways by\napplying the harvesting technology to their nutrient-rich waste streams.\nD\nBlended with conventional mineral diesel, bio-diesel can run vehicles without the need for\nvehicle modifications. Fuel derived from algae can also help meet the Government B5 (5%\nblended) target, with the prospect of this increase over time as bio-fuel production\nincreases. “Our next step is to increase capacity to produce one million litres of bio-diesel\nfrom the Marlborough sewerage ponds over the next year,” says Leay. Aquaflow will launch\na prospectus pre-Christmas as the company has already attracted considerable interest\nfrom potential investors. The test drive bio-diesel was used successfully in a static engine\ntest at Massey University’s Wellington campus on Monday, December 11.\nE\n \n1\n\nToday Algae are used by humans in many ways; for example, as fertilizers, soil\nconditioners and livestock feed. Aquatic and microscopic species are cultured in clear\ntanks or ponds and are either harvested or used to treat effluents pumped through the\nponds. Algaculture on a large scale is an important type of aquaculture in some places.\nNaturally growing seaweeds are an important source of food, especially in Asia. They\nprovide many vitamins including A, B, B2, B6, niacin and C, and are rich in iodine,\npotassium, iron, magnesium and calcium. In addition, commercially cultivated microalgae,\nincluding both Algae and Cyan-bacteria, are marketed as nutritional supplements, such as\nSpirulina, Chlorella and the Vitamin-C supplement, Dunaliella, high in beta-carotene. Algae\nare national foods of many nations: China consumes more than 70 species, including fat\nchoy, a cyanobacterium considered a vegetable; Japan, over 20 species. The natural\npigments produced by algae can be used as an alternative to chemical dyes and coloring\nagents.\nF\nAlgae are the simplest plant organisms that convert sunlight and carbon dioxide in the air\naround us into stored energy through the well-understood process of photosynthesis. Algae\nare rich in lipids and other combustible elements and Aquaflow is developing technology\nthat will allow these elements to be extracted in a cost-effective way. The proposed\nprocess is the subject of a provisional patent. Although algae are good at taking most of the\nnutrients out of sewage, too many algae can taint the water and make it smell. So, councils\nhave to find a way of cleaning up the excess algae in their sewerage outflows and then\neither dispose of it or find alternative uses for it. And that’s where Aquaflow comes in.\nG\nUnlike some bio-fuels which require crops to be specially grown and thereby compete for\nland use with food production, and use other scarce resources of fuel, chemicals and\nfertiliser, the source for algae-based biodiesel already exists extensively and the process\nproduces a sustainable net energy gain by capturing free solar energy from the sun.\n \n2",
