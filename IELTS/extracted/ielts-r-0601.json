  "passage_text": "Reading Practice\n \nUnexpected Benefits to Human Brain\nJames Paul Gee, professor of education at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, played his\nfirst video game years ago when his six-year-old son Sam was playing Pajama Sam: No\nNeed to Hide When It’s Dark Outside. He wanted to play the game so he could support\nSam’s problem solving. Though Pajama Sam is not an “educational game”, it is replete with\nthe types of problems psychologists study when they study thinking and learning. When he\nsaw how well the game held Sam’s attention, he wondered what sort of beast a more\nmature video game might be.\nVideo and computer games, like many other popular, entertaining and addicting kid’s\nactivities, are looked down upon by many parents as time-wasters, and worse, parents\nthink that these games rot the brain. Violent video games are readily blamed by the media\nand some experts as the reason why some youth become violent or commit extreme anti-\nsocial behavior. Recent content analyses of video games show that as many as 89% of\ngames contain some violent content, but there is no form of aggressive content for 70% of\npopular games. Many scientists and psychologists, like James Paul Gee, find that video\ngames actually have many benefits – the main one being making kids smart. Video games\nmay actually teach kids high-level thinking skills that they will need in the future.\n“Video games change your brain,” according to University of Wisconsin psychologist\nShawn Green. Video games change the brain’s physical structure the same way as do\nlearning to read, playing the piano, or navigating using a map. Much like exercise can build\nmuscle, the powerful combination of concentration and rewarding surges of\nneurotransmitters like dopamine, which strengthens neural circuits, can build the player’s\nbrain.\nVideo games give your child’s brain a real workout. In many video games, the skills\nrequired to win involve abstract and high level thinking. These skills are not even taught at\nschool. Some of the mental skills trained by video games include: following instructions,\nproblem solving, logic, hand-eye coordination, fine motor and spatial skills. Research also\nsuggests that people can learn iconic, spatial, and visual attention skills from video games.\nThere have been even studies with adults showing that experience with video games is\nrelated to better surgical skills. Jacob Benjamin, doctor from Beth Israel Medical Center\nNY, found a direct link between skill at video gaming and skill at keyhole or laparoscopic\nsurgery. Also, a reason given by experts as to why fighter pilots of today are more skillful is\nthat this generation’s pilots are being weaned on video games.\nThe players learn to manage resources that are limited, and decide the best use of\nresources, the same way as in real life. In strategy games, for instance, while developing a\ncity, an unexpected surprise like an enemy might emerge. This forces the player to be\nflexible and quickly change tactics. Sometimes the player does this almost every second of\nthe game giving the brain a real workout. According to researchers at the University of\nRochester, led by Daphne Bavelier, a cognitive scientist, games simulating stressful events\nsuch as those found in battle or action games could be a training tool for real-world\nsituations. The study suggests that playing action video games primes the brain to make\nquick decisions. Video games can be used to train soldiers and surgeons, according to the\nstudy. Steven Johnson, author of Everything Bad is Good For You: How Today’s Popular\nCulture, says gamers must deal with immediate problems while keeping their long-term\n \n1\n\ngoals on their horizon. Young gamers force themselves to read to get instructions, follow\nstorylines of games, and get information from the game texts.\nJames Paul Gee, professor of education at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, says that\nplaying a video game is similar to working through a science problem Like students in a\nlaboratory, gamers must come up with a hypothesis. For example, players in some games\nconstantly try out combinations of weapons and powers to use to defeat an enemy. If one\ndoes not work, they change hypothesis and try the next one. Video games are goal-driven\nexperiences, says Gee, which are fundamental to learning. Also, using math skills is\nimportant to win in many games that involve quantitative analysis like managing resources.\nIn higher levels of a game, players usually fail the first time around, but they keep on trying\nuntil they succeed and move on to the next level.\nMany games are played online and involve cooperation with other online players in order to\nwin. Video and computer games also help children gain self-confidence and many games\nare based on history, city building, and governance and so on. Such games indirectly teach\nchildren about aspects of life on earth.\nIn an upcoming study in the journal Current Biology, authors Daphne Bavelier, Alexandre\nPouget, and C. Shawn Green report that video games could provide a potent training\nregimen for speeding up reactions in many types of real-life situations. The researchers\ntested dozens of 18- to 25-year-olds who were not ordinarily video game players. They split\nthe subjects into two groups. One group played 50 hours of the fast-paced action video\ngames “Call of Duty 2” and “Unreal Tournament,” and the other group played 50 hours of\nthe slow-moving strategy game “The Sims 2.” After this training period, all of the subjects\nwere asked to make quick decisions in several tasks designed by the researchers. The\naction game players were up to 25 percent faster at coming to a conclusion and answered\njust as many questions correctly as their strategy game playing peers.\n \n2",
