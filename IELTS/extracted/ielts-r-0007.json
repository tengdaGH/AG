  "passage_text": "Reading Practice\n \nAdvantages of public transport\nA new study conducted for the World Bank by Murdoch University's Institute for Science\nand Technology Policy (ISTP) has demonstrated that public transport is more efficient than\ncars. The study compared the proportion of wealth poured into transport by thirty-seven\ncities around the world. This included both the public and private costs of building,\nmaintaining and using a transport system.\nThe study found that the Western Australian city of Perth is a good example of a city with\nminimal public transport. As a result, 17% of its wealth went into transport costs.\nSome European and Asian cities, on the other hand, spent as little as 5%. Professor Peter\nNewman, ISTP Director, pointed out that these more efficient cities were able to put the\ndifference into attracting industry and jobs or creating a better place to live.\nAccording to Professor Newman, the larger Australian city of Melbourne is a rather unusual\ncity in this sort of comparison. He describes it as two cities: 'A European city surrounded by\na car-dependent one'. Melbourne's large tram network has made car use in the inner city\nmuch lower, but the outer suburbs have the same car-based structure as most other\nAustralian cities. The explosion in demand for accommodation in the inner suburbs of\nMelbourne suggests a recent change in many people's preferences as to where they live.\nNewman says this is a new, broader way of considering public transport issues. In the past,\nthe case for public transport has been made on the basis of environmental and social\njustice considerations rather than economics. Newman, however, believes the study\ndemonstrates that 'the auto-dependent city model is inefficient and grossly inadequate in\neconomic as well as environmental terms'.\nBicycle use was not included in the study but Newman noted that the two most 'bicycle\nfriendly' cities considered - Amsterdam and Copenhagen - were very efficient, even though\ntheir public transport systems were 'reasonable but not special'.\nIt is common for supporters of road networks to reject the models of cities with good public\ntransport by arguing that such systems would not work in their particular city. One objection\nis climate. Some people say their city could not make more use of public transport because\nit is either too hot or too cold. Newman rejects this, pointing out that public transport has\nbeen successful in both Toronto and Singapore and, in fact, he has checked the use of\ncars against climate and found 'zero correlation'. \nWhen it comes to other physical features, road lobbies are on stronger ground. For\nexample, Newman accepts it would be hard for a city as hilly as Auckland to develop a\nreally good rail network. However, he points out that both Hong Kong and Zurich have\nmanaged to make a success of their rail systems, heavy and light respectively, though\nthere are few cities in the world as hilly.    \nA\nIn fact, Newman believes the main reason for adopting one sort of transport over another is\npolitics: 'The more democratic the process, the more public transport is favored.' He\nconsiders Portland, Oregon, a perfect example of this. Some years ago, federal money was\ngranted to build a new road. However, local pressure groups forced a referendum over\n \n1\n\nwhether to spend the money on light rail instead. The rail proposal won and the railway\nworked spectacularly well. In the years that have followed, more and more rail systems\nhave been put in, dramatically changing the nature of the city. Newman notes that Portland\nhas about the same population as Perth and had a similar population density at the time.\nB\nIn the UK, travel times to work had been stable for at least six centuries, with people\navoiding situations that required them to spend more than half an hour travelling to work.\nTrains and cars initially allowed people to live at greater distances without taking longer to\nreach their destination. However, public infrastructure did not keep pace with urban sprawl,\ncausing massive congestion problems which now make commuting times far higher.\nC\nThere is a widespread belief that increasing wealth encourages people to live farther out\nwhere cars are the only viable transport. The example of European cities refutes that. They\nare-often wealthier than their American counterparts but have not generated the same level\nof car use. In Stockholm, car use has actually fallen in recent years as the city has become\nlarger and wealthier. A new study makes this point even more starkly. Developing cities in\nAsia, such as Jakarta and Bangkok, make more use of the car than wealthy Asian cities\nsuch as Tokyo and Singapore. In cities that developed later, the World Bank and Asian\nDevelopment Bank discouraged the building of public transport and people have been\nforced to rely on cars -creating the massive traffic jams that characterize those cities.\nD\nNewman believes one of the best studies on how cities built for cars might be converted to\nrail use is The Urban Village report, which used Melbourne as an example. It found that\npushing everyone into the city centre was not the best approach. Instead, the proposal\nadvocated the creation of urban villages at hundreds of sites, mostly around railway\nstations.\nE\nIt was once assumed that improvements in telecommunications would lead to more\ndispersal in the population as people were no longer forced into cities. However, the ISTP\nteam's research demonstrates that the population and job density of cities rose or\nremained constant in the 1980s after decades of decline. The explanation for this seems to\nbe that it is valuable to place people working in related fields together. 'The new world will\nlargely depend on human creativity, and creativity flourishes where people come together\nface-to-face.'\n \n2",
