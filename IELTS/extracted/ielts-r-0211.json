As\nresearchers from the Brooklyn Food Association enter the details, colorful dots appear on\ntheir online map, which display the specific location of each of the food stores in a handful\nof central Brooklyn neighborhoods. Clicking on a dot will show you the store's name and\nwhether it carries fresh fruit and vegetables, wholegrain bread, low-fat dairy and other\nhealthy options.\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe researchers plan eventually to survey the entire borough of Brooklyn. ‘We want to get\nto a more specific and detailed description of what that looks like’, says Jeffrey Heehs, who\nleads the project. He hopes it will help residents find fresh food in urban areas where the\nstores sell mostly packaged snacks or fast food, areas otherwise known as food deserts.\nThe aim of the project is also to assist government officials in assessing food availability,\nand in forming future policies about what kind of food should be sold and where.\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nIn fact, the Brooklyn project represents the intersection of two growing trends: mapping\nfresh food markets in US cities, and private citizens creating online maps of local\nneighborhood features. According to Michael Goodchild, a geographer at the University of\nCalifornia at Santa Barbara, citizen map makers may make maps because there is no good\ngovernment map, or to record problems such as burned-out traffic lights.\nAccording to recent studies, people at higher risk of chronic disease and who receive\nminimal incomes for the work they do, frequently live in neighborhoods located in food\ndeserts. But how did these food deserts arise? Linda Alwitt and Thomas Donley, marketing\nresearchers at DePaul University in Chicago, found that supermarkets often can’t afford the\namount of land required for their stores in cities. City planning researcher Cliff Guy and\ncolleagues at the University of Leeds in the UK found in 2004 that smaller urban groceries\ntend to close due to competition from suburban supermarkets.\nAs fresh food stores leave a neighborhood, residents find it harder to eat well and stay\nhealthy. Food deserts are linked with lower local health outcomes, and they may be a\ndriving force in the health disparities between lower-income and affluent people in the US.\nUntil recently, the issue attracted little national attention, and received no ongoing funding\nfor research.\nNow, more US cities are becoming aware of their food landscapes. Last year, the United\nStates Department of Agriculture launched a map of where food stores are located in all\nthe US counties. Mari Gallagher, who runs a private consulting firm, says her researchers\nhave mapped food stores and related them to health statistics for the cities of Detroit,\nChicago, Cincinnati and Washington, D.c. These maps help cities identify where food\ndeserts are and, occasionally, have documented that people living in food deserts have\nhigher rates of diet-related diseases.\nThe Brooklyn project differs in that it’s run by a local core of five volunteers who have\nworked on the project for the past year, rather than trained, academic researchers. To\n \n1\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ngather data, they simply go to individual stores with pre-printed surveys in hand, and once\nthe storekeeper's permission has been obtained, check off boxes on their list against the\nproducts for sole in the store. Their approach to data collection and research has been\nmade possible by technologies such as mapping software and GPS-related smart phones,\nGoogle Maps and OpenStreeMap, an open-source online map with a history of\ninvolvement in social issues. Like Brooklyn Food Association volunteers, many citizen\nonline map makers use maps to bring local problems to official attention, Goodchild says.\nHeehs, the mapping project leader, says that after his group gathers more data, it will\ncompare neighborhoods, come up with solutions to address local needs, and then present\nthem to New York City officials. Their website hasn’t caught them much local or official\nattention yet, however. It was launched only recently, but its creators haven’t yet set up\nsystems to see who’s looking at it.\nExperts who visited the Brooklyn group’s site were optimistic but cautious. ‘This kind of\ndetailed information could be very useful’ says Michele Ver Ploeg, an economist for the\nDepartment of Agriculture. To make the map more helpful to both residents and policy\nmakers, she would like to see price data for healthy products, too. Karen Ansel, a\nregistered dietician and a spokesperson for the American Dietetic Association, found the\nsite confusing to navigate. ‘That said, with this information in place the group has the tools\nto build a more user-friendly site that could be ... very helpful to consumers’, she says. ‘The\ngroup also should ensure their map is available to those who don’t have internet access at\nhome’, she adds. In fact, a significant proportion of Brooklyn residents don’t have internet\naccess at home and 8 percent rely on dial-up service, instead of high-speed internet\naccess, according to Gretchen Maneval, director of Brooklyn College’s Center for the study\nof Brooklyn. ‘It’s still very much a work in progress’, Heehs says of the online map. They’ll\nstart advertising it online and by email to other community groups, such as urban food\ngarden associations, next month. He also hopes warmer days in the spring will draw out\nfresh volunteers to spread awareness and to finish surveying, as they have about two-\nthirds of Brooklyn left to cover.\n \n2",
