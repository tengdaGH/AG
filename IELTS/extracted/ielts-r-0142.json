  "passage_text": "Reading Practice\n \nEconomic Evolution\n{A} Living along the Orinoco River that borders Brazil and Venezuela are the Yanomami\npeople, hunter-gatherers whose average annual income has been estimated at the\nequivalent of $90 per person per year. Living along the Hudson River that borders New\nYork State and New Jersey are the Manhattan people, consumer traders whose average\nannual income has been estimated at $36,000 per person per year. That dramatic\ndifference of 400 times, however, pales in comparison to the differences in Stock Keeping\nUnits (SKUs, a measure of the number of types of retail products available), which has\nbeen estimated at 300 for the Yanomami and 10 billion for the Manhattans, a difference of\n33 million times.\n \n{B} How did this happen? According to economist Eric D. Beinhocker, who published these\ncalculations in his revelatory work The Origin of Wealth (Harvard Business School Press,\n2006), the explanation is to be found in complexity theory. Evolution and economics are not\njust analogous to each other, but they are actually two forms of a larger phenomenon\ncalled complex adaptive systems, in which individual elements, parts or agents interact,\nthen process information and adapt their behaviour to changing conditions. Immune\nsystems, ecosystems, language, the law and the Internet are all examples of complex\nadaptive systems.\n{C} In biological evolution, nature selects from the variation produced by random genetic\nmutations and the mixing of parental genes. Out of that process of cumulative selection\nemerges complexity and diversity. In economic evolution, our material economy proceeds\nthrough the production and selection of numerous permutations of countless products.\nThose 10 billion products in the Manhattan village represent only those variations that\nmade it to market, after which there is a cumulative selection by consumers in the\nmarketplace for those deemed most useful: VHS over Betamax, DVDs over VHS, CDs over\nvinyl records, flip phones over brick phones, computers over typewriters, Google over\nAltavista, SUVs over station wagons, paper books over e-books (still), and Internet news\nover network news (soon). Those that are purchased “survive” and “reproduce” into the\nfuture through repetitive use and remanufacturing.\n{D} As with living organisms and ecosystems, the economy looks designed—so just as\nHumans naturally deduce the existence of a top-down intelligent designer, humans also\n(understandably) infer that a top-down government designer is needed in nearly every\naspect of the economy. But just as living organisms are shaped from the bottom up by\nnatural selection, the economy is moulded from the bottom up by the invisible hand. The\ncorrespondence between evolution and economics is not perfect, because some top-down\ninstitutional rules and laws are needed to provide a structure within which free and fair\ntrade can occur. But too much top-down interference into the marketplace makes trade\nneither free nor fair. When such attempts have been made in the past, they have\nfailed—because markets are far too complex, interactive and autocatalytic to be designed\nfrom the top down. In his 1922 book, Socialism, Ludwig Von Mises spelt out the reasons\nwhy most notably the problem of “economic calculation” in a planned socialist economy. In\ncapitalism, prices are in constant and rapid flux and are determined from below by\nindividuals freely exchanging in the marketplace. Money is a means of exchange, and\nprices are the information people use to guide their choices. Von Mises demonstrated that\n \n1\n\nsocialist economies depend on capitalist economies to determine what prices should be\nassigned to goods and services. And they do so cumbersomely and inefficiently. Relatively\nfree markets are, ultimately, the only way to find out what buyers are willing to pay and\nwhat sellers are willing to accept.\n \n{E} Economics helps to explain how Yanomami-like hunter-gatherers evolved into\nManhattan-like consumer traders. In the Nineteenth century French economist Frédéric\nBastiat well captured the principle: “Where goods do not cross frontiers, armies will.” In\naddition to being fierce warriors, the Yanomami are also sophisticated traders, and the\nmore they trade the less they fight. The reason is that trade is a powerful social adhesive\nthat creates political alliances. One village cannot go to another village and announce that\nthey are worried about being conquered by a third, more powerful village—that would\nreveal weakness. Instead, they mask the real motives for alliance through trade and\nreciprocal feasting. And, as a result, not only gain military protection but also initiate a\nsystem of trade that—in the long run—leads to an increase in both wealth and SKUs. \n{F} Free and fair trade occurs in societies where most individuals interact in ways that\nprovide mutual benefit. The necessary rules weren’t generated by wise men in a sacred\ntemple or lawmakers in congress, but rather evolved over generations and were widely\naccepted and practised before the law was ever written. Laws that fail this test are ignored.\nIf enforcement becomes too onerous, there is rebellion. Yet the concept that human\ninteraction must, and can be controlled by a higher force is universal. Interestingly, there is\nno widespread agreement on who the “higher force” is. Religious people ascribe good\nbehaviour to God’s law. They cannot conceive of an orderly society of atheists. Secular\npeople credit the government. They consider anarchy to be synonymous with barbarity.\nEveryone seems to agree on the concept that an orderly society requires an omnipotent\nforce. Yet, everywhere there is evidence that this is not so. An important distinction\nbetween spontaneous social order and social anarchy is that the former is developed by\nwork and investment, under the rule of law and with a set of evolved morals while the latter\nis chaos. The classical liberal tradition of von Mises and Hayek never makes the claim that\nthe complete absence of top-down rules leads to the optimal social order. It simply says we\nshould be sceptical about our ability to manage them in the name of social justice, equality,\nor progress.\n \n2",
