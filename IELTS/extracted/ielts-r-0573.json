  "passage_text": "Reading Practice\n \nThe way the brain buys\nSupermarkets take great care over the way the goods they sell are arranged. This is\nbecause they know a lot about how to persuade people to buy things.\nWhen yon enter a supermarket, it takes some time for the mind to get into a shopping\nmode. This is why the area immediately inside the entrance of a supermarket is known as\nthe ‘decompression zone’. People need to slow down and take stock of the surroundings,\neven if they are regulars. Supermarkets do not expect to sell much here, so it tends to be\nused more for promotion. So the large items piled up here are designed to suggest that\nthere are bargains further inside the store, and shoppers are not necessarily expected to\nbuy them. Walmart, the world’s biggest retailer, famously employs ‘greeters’ at the\nentrance to its stores. A friendly welcome is said to cut shoplifting. It is harder to steal from\nnice people.\nImmediately to the left in many supermarkets is a ‘chill zone’, where customers can enjoy\nbrowsing magazines, books and DVDs. This is intended to tempt unplanned purchases and\nslow customers down. But people who just want to do their shopping quickly will keep\nwalking ahead, and the first thing they come to is the fresh fruit and vegetables section.\nHowever, for shoppers, this makes no sense. Fruit and vegetables can be easily damaged,\nso they should be bought at the end, not the beginning, of a shopping trip. But psychology\nis at work here: selecting these items makes people feel good, so they feel less guilty about\nreaching for less healthy food later on.\nShoppers already know that everyday items, like milk, arc invariably placed towards the\nback of a store to provide more opportunity to tempt customers to buy things which are not\non their shopping list. This is why pharmacies are also generally at the back. But\nsupermarkets know shoppers know this, so they use other tricks, like placing popular items\nhalfway along a section so that people have to walk all along the aisle looking for them.\nThe idea is to boost ‘dwell time’: the length of time people spend in a store.\nHaving walked to the end of the fruit-and-vegetable aisle, shoppers arrive at counters of\nprepared food, the fishmonger, the butcher and the deli. Then there is the in-store bakery,\nwhich can be smelt before it is seen. Even small supermarkets now use in store bakeries.\nMostly these bake pre-prepared items and frozen ingredients which have been delivered to\nthe supermarket previously, and their numbers have increased, even though central\nbakeries that deliver to a number of stores are much more efficient. They do it for the smell\nof freshly baked bread, which arouses people’s appetites and thus encourages them to\npurchase not just bread but also other food, including ready meals.\nRetailers and producers talk a lot about the ‘moment of truth’. This is not a philosophical\nidea, but the point when people standing in the aisle decide to buy something and reach to\nget it. At the instant coffee section, for example, branded products from the big producers\nare arranged at eye level while cheaper ones are lower down, along with the supermarket’s\nown label products.\nBut shelf positioning is fiercely fought over, not just by those trying to sell goods, but also\nby those arguing over how best to manipulate shoppers. While many stores reckon eye\nlevel is the top spot, some think a little higher is better. Others think goods displayed at the\nend of aisles sell the most because they have the greatest visibility. To be on the right-hand\n \n1\n\n \n \nside of an eye-level selection is often considered the very best place, because most people\nare right-handed and most people’s eyes drift rightwards. Some supermarkets reserve that\nfor their most expensive own-label goods.\nScott Bearse, a retail expert with Deloitte Consulting in Boston, Massachusetts, has led\nprojects observing and questioning tens of thousands of customers about how they feel\nabout shopping. People say they leave shops empty- handed more often because they are\n‘unable to decide’ than because prices are too high, says Mr Bearse. Getting customers to\ntry something is one of the best ways of getting them to buy, adds Mr Bearse. Deloitte\nfound that customers who use fitting rooms in order to try on clothes buy the product they\nare considering at a rate of 8j% compared with 58% for those that do not do so.\n \nOften a customer struggling to decide which of two items is best ends up not buying either.\nIn order to avoid a situation where a customer decides not to buy either product, a third\n‘decoy’ item, which is not quite as good as the other two, is placed beside them to make\nthe choice easier and more pleasurable.
