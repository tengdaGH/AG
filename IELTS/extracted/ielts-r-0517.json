  "passage_text": "Reading Practice\n \nThe Motor Car\nA\nThere are now over 700 million motor vehicles in the world - and the number is rising by\nmore than 40 million each year. The average distance driven by car users is growing too -\nfrom 8 km a day per person in western Europe in 1965 to 25 km a day in 1995. This\ndependence on motor vehicles has given rise to major problems, including environmental\npollution, depletion of oil resources, traffic congestion and safety.\nB \nWhile emissions from new cars are far less harmful than they used to be, city streets and\nmotorways are becoming more crowded than ever, often with older trucks, buses and taxis,\nwhich emit excessive levels of smoke and fumes. This concentration of vehicles makes air\nquality in urban areas unpleasant and sometimes dangerous to breathe. Even Moscow has\njoined the list of capitals afflicted by congestion and traffic fumes. In Mexico City, vehicle\npollution is a major health hazard.\nC\nUntil a hundred years ago, most journeys were in the 20 km range, the distance\nconveniently accessible by horse. Heavy freight could only be carried by water or rail. The\ninvention of the motor vehicle brought personal mobility to the masses and made rapid\nfreight delivery possible over a much wider area. Today about 90 per cent of inland freight\nin the United Kingdom is carried by road. Clearly the world cannot revert to the horse-\ndrawn wagon. Can it avoid being locked into congested and polluting ways of transporting\npeople and goods?\nD\nIn Europe most cities are still designed for the old modes of transport. Adaptation to the\nmotor car has involved adding ring roads, one-way systems and parking lots. In the United\nStates, more land is assigned to car use than to housing. Urban sprawl means that life\nwithout a car is next to impossible. Mass use of motor vehicles has also killed or injured\nmillions of people. Other social effects have been blamed on the car such as alienation and\naggressive human behaviour.\nE\nA 1993 study by the European Federation for Transport and Environment found that car\ntransport is seven times as costly as rail travel in terms of the external social costs it entails\nsuch as congestion, accidents, pollution, loss of cropland and natural habitats, depletion of\noil resources, and so on. Yet cars easily surpass trains or buses as a flexible and\nconvenient mode of personal transport. It is unrealistic to expect people to give up private\ncars in favour of mass transit.\nF\nTechnical solutions can reduce the pollution problem and increase the fuel efficiency of\nengines. But fuel consumption and exhaust emissions depend on which cars are preferred\n \n1\n\nby customers and how they are driven. Many people buy larger cars than they need for\ndaily purposes or waste fuel by driving aggressively. Besides, global car use is increasing\nat a faster rate than the improvement in emissions and fuel efficiency which technology is\nnow making possible.\nG\nOne solution that has been put forward is the long-term solution of designing cities and\nneighbourhoods so that car journeys are not necessary - all essential services being\nlocated within walking distance or easily accessible by public transport. Not only would this\nsave energy and cut carbon dioxide emissions, it would also enhance the quality of\ncommunity life, putting the emphasis on people instead of cars. Good local government is\nalready bringing this about in some places. But few democratic communities are blessed\nwith the vision - and the capital - to make such profound changes in modern lifestyles.\nH\nA more likely scenario seems to be a combination of mass transit systems for travel into\nand around cities, with small 'low emission' cars for urban use and larger hybrid or lean\nburn cars for use elsewhere. Electronically tolled highways might be used to ensure that\ndrivers pay charges geared to actual road use. Better integration of transport systems is\nalso highly desirable - and made more feasible by modern computers. But these are\nsolutions for countries which can afford them. In most developing countries, old cars and\nold technologies continue to predominate.\n \n2",
