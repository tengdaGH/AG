  "passage_text": "Reading Practice\n \nThe accidental rainforest\nAccording to ecological theory, rainforests are supposed to develop slowly over\nmillions of years. But now ecologists are being forced to reconsider their ideas\nWhen PeterOsbeck. a Swedish priest, stopped off at the mid-Atlantic island of Ascension in\n1752 on his way home from China, he wrote of ‘a heap of ruinous rocks’ with a bare, white\nmountain in the middle. All it boasted was a couple of dozen species of plant, most of them\nferns and some of them unique to the island.\n \nAnd so it might have remained. But in 1843 British plant collector Joseph Hooker made a\nbrief call on his return from Antarctica. Surveying the bare earth, he concluded that the\nisland had suffered some natural calamity that had denuded it of vegetation and triggered a\ndecline in rainfall that was turning the place into a desert. The British Navy, which by then\nmaintained a garrison on the island, was keen to improve the place and asked Hooker's\nadvice. He suggested an ambitious scheme for planting trees and shrubs that would revive\nrainfall and stimulate a wider ecological recovery. And, perhaps lacking anything else to do,\nthe sailors set to with a will.\nIn 1845, a naval transport ship from Argentina delivered a batch of seedlings. In the\nfollowing years, more than 200 species of plant arrived from South Africa, from England\ncame 700 packets of seeds, including those of two species that especially liked the place:\nbamboo and prickly pear. With sailors planting several thousand trees a year, the bare\nwhite mountain was soon cloaked in green and renamed Green Mountain, and by the early\ntwentieth century the mountain's slopes were covered with a variety of trees and shrubs\nfrom all over the world.\nModern ecologists throw up their hands in horror at what they see as Hookers\nenvironmental anarchy. The exotic species wrecked the indigenous ecosystem, squeezing\nout the islands endemic plants. In fact. Hooker knew well enough what might happen.\nHowever, he saw greater benefit in improving rainfall and encouraging more prolific\nvegetation on the island.\nBut there is a much deeper issue here than the relative benefits of sparse endemic species\nversus luxuriant imported ones. And as botanist David Wilkinson of Liverpool John Moores\nUniversity in the UK pointed out after a recent visit to the island, it goes to the heart of\nsome of the most dearly held tenets of ecology. Conservationists' understandable concern\nfor the fate of Ascension’s handful of unique species has, he says, blinded them to\nsomething quite astonishing the fact that the introduced species have been a roaring\nsuccess.\nToday's Green Mountain, says Wilkinson, is ‘a fully functioning man-made tropical cloud\nforest' that has grown from scratch from a ragbag of species collected more or less at\nrandom from all over the planet. But how could it have happened? Conventional ecological\ntheory says that complex ecosystems such as cloud forests can emerge only through\nevolutionary processes in which each organism develops in concert with others to fill\nparticular niches. Plants eo-evolve with their pollinators and seed dispersers, while\n \n1\n\nmicrobes in the soil evolve to deal with the leaf litter.\nBut that’s not what happened on Green Mountain. And the experience suggests that\nperhaps natural rainforests are constructed far more by chance than by evolution. Species,\nsay some ecologists, don’t so much evolve to create ecosystems as make the best of what\nthey have. ‘The Green Mountain system is a man-made system that has produced a\ntropical rainforest without any co-evolution between its constituent species,’ says\nWilkinson.\nNot everyone agrees. Alan Gray, an ecologist at the University of Edinburgh in the UK.\nargues that the surviving endemic species on Green Mountain, though small in number,\nmay still form the framework of the new' ecosystem. The new arrivals may just be an\nadornment, with little structural importance for the ecosystem.\nBut to Wilkinson this sounds like clutching at straws. And the idea of the instant formation\nof rainforests sounds increasingly plausible as research reveals that supposedly pristine\ntropical rainforests from the Amazon to south-east Asia may in places be little more titan\nthe overgrown gardens of past rainforest civilisations.\nThe most surprising thing of all is that no ecologists have thought to conduct proper\nresearch into this human-made rainforest ecosystem. A survey of the island’s flora\nconducted six years ago by the University of Edinburgh was concerned only with endemic\nspecies. They characterised everything else as a threat. And the Ascension authorities are\ncurrently turning Green Mountain into a national park where introduced species, at least the\ninvasive ones, are earmarked for culling rather than conservation.\nConservationists have understandable concerns, Wilkinson says. At least four endemic\nspecies have gone extinct on Ascension since the exotics started arriving. But in their\nurgency to protect endemics, ecologists are missing out on the study of a great enigma.\n‘As you walk through the forest, you see lots of leaves that have had chunks taken out of\nthem by various insects. There are caterpillars and beetles around.' says Wilkinson. ‘But\nwhere did they come from? Are they endemic or alien? If alien, did they come with the plant\non which they feed or discover it on arrival?’ Such questions go to the heart of how-\nrainforests happen.\nThe Green Mountain forest holds many secrets. And the irony is that the most artificial\nrainforest in the world could tell us more about rainforest ecology than any number of\nnatural forests.\n \n2",
