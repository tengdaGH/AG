  "passage_text": "Reading Practice\n \nThe future never dies?\nThe prospects for humanity and for the world as a whole are somewhere between glorious\nand dire. It is hard to be much more precise.\nA\nBy ‘glorious’, I mean that our descendants – all who are born on to this Earth – could live\nvery comfortably and securely, and could continue to do so for as long as the Earth can\nsupport life, which should be for a very long time indeed. We should at least be thinking in\nterms of the next million years. Furthermore, our descendants could continue to enjoy the\ncompany of other species – establishing a much better relationship with them than we have\nnow. Other animals need not live in constant fear of us. Many of those fellow species now\nseem bound to become extinct, but a significant proportion could and should continue to\nlive alongside us. Such a future may seem ideal, and so it is. Yet I do not believe it is\nfanciful. There is nothing in the physical fabric of the Earth or in our own biology to suggest\nthat this is not possible. \nB\n‘Dire’ means that we human beings could be in deep trouble within the next few centuries,\nliving but also dying in large numbers in political terror and from starvation, while huge\nnumbers of our fellow creatures would simply disappear, leaving only the ones that we find\nconvenient – chickens, cattle – or that we can’t shake off, like flies and mice. I’m taking it to\nbe self-evident that glory is preferable. \nC\nOur future is not entirely in our own hands because the Earth has its own rules, is part of\nthe solar system and is neither stable nor innately safe. Other planets in the solar system\nare quite beyond habitation, because their temperature is far too high or too low to be\nendured, and ours, too, in principle could tip either way. Even relatively unspectacular\nchanges in the atmosphere could do the trick. The core of the Earth is hot, which in many\nways is good for living creatures, but every now and again, the molten rock bursts through\nvolcanoes on the surface. Among the biggest volcanic eruptions in recent memory was\nMount St Helens, in the USA, which threw out a cubic kilometre of ash – fortunately, in an\narea where very few people live. In 1815, Tambora (in present-day Indonesia) expelled so\nmuch ash into the upper atmosphere that climatic effects seriously harmed food production\naround the world for the season after season. Entire civilisations have been destroyed by\nvolcanoes. \nD\nYet nothing we have so far experienced shows what volcanoes can really do. Yellowstone\nNational Park in the USA occupies the caldera (the crater formed when a volcano\ncollapses) of an exceedingly ancient volcano of extraordinary magnitude. Modem surveys\nshow that its centre is now rising. Sometime in the next 200 million years, Yellowstone\ncould erupt again, and when it does, the whole world will be transformed. Yellowstone\ncould erupt tomorrow. But there’s a very good chance that it will give us another million\nyears, and that surely is enough to be going on with. It seems sensible to assume that this\nwill be the case.\n \n1\n\nE\nThe universe at large is dangerous, too: in particular, we share the sky with vast numbers\nof asteroids, and now and again, the come into our planet’s atmosphere. An asteroid the\nsize of a small island, hitting the Earth at 15,000 kilometres an hour (a relatively modest\nspeed by the standards of heavenly bodies), would strike the ocean bed like a rock in a\npuddle, send a tidal wave around the world as high as a small mountain and as fast as a\njumbo jet, and propel us into an ice age that could last for centuries. There are plans to\nhead off such disasters (including rockets to push approaching asteroids into new\ntrajectories), but in truth, it’s down to luck. \nF\nOn the other hand, the archaeological and the fossil evidence shows that no truly\ndevastating asteroid has struck since the one that seems to have accounted for the\nextinction of the dinosaurs 65 million years ago. So again, there seems no immediate\nreason for despair. The Earth is indeed an uncertain place, in an uncertain universe, but\nwith average luck, it should do us well enough. If the world does become inhospitable in the\nnext few thousand or million years, then it will probably be our own fault. In short, despite\nthe underlying uncertainty, our own future and that of our fellow creatures are very much in\nour own hands.\nG\nGiven average luck on the geological and the cosmic scale, the difference between glory\nand disaster will be made and is being made, by politics. Certain kinds of political systems\nand strategies would predispose us to long-term survival (and indeed to comfort and\nsecurity and pleasure of being alive), while others would take us more and\nmore frenetically towards collapse. The broad point is, though, that we need to look at\nourselves – humanity – and at the world in general in a quite new light. Our material\nproblems are fundamentally those of biology. We need to think, and we need our politicians\nto think, biologically. Do that, and take the ideas seriously, and we are in with a chance.\nIgnore biology and we and our fellow creatures haven’t a hope.\n \n2",
