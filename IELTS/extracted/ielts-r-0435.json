In the UK, football is the national sporting obsession. While many UK teams have\ngained international recognition, Manchester United is among those most well-known on a\nglobal scale. Yet while most people, regardless of the sporting preference or nationality,\nhave some passing knowledge of Manchester United, fewer can claim knowledge of the\norigins of the team. Manchester United came into being in 1902 as a result of bankruptcy of\nthe team formerly known as Newton Heath. Newton Heath began life as Newton Heath\nLYR (Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway) club and as the name suggests, the original team\nwas comprised of railway workers. Despite turning professional in 1885 and becoming the\nfounding member of the Football Lions in 1889, Newton Heath – nicknamed the ‘Heathens’\n– was constantly troubled by financial difficulties.\nB\nSalvation came in the form of local brewer, John Henry Davis, who agreed to invest in the\nteam on condition of being given some interest in running it. After consideration of the\nalternatives titles of Manchester Central and Manchester Celtic, the club was christened\nManchester United in April 1902. United’s first manager, though officially titled Secretary,\nwas Ernest Mangnall, who was appointed in September 1903, but it was not until the\nseason of 1905/1906, that United experienced its first taste of success. His side reached\nthe quarterfinals of the F.A, Cup and were runners up in the second division.\nC\nIn 1907, United claimed the championship for the first time and won the first ever Charity\nShield trophy in 1908. In the following year, United claimed the F.A. Cup trophy after\nbeating Bristol City. Manchester United moved to its new stadium, Old Trafford, in early\n1910. The move to the stadium, owned by the John Henry Davis brewery (a Manchester\nbeer-making company), was proven to be fortunate as on the 17th of February, 1910, two\ndays before the team’s first scheduled game, the previous stadium Banks Street was\ndestroyed in a fire. The new stadium had a capacity for a crowd of 80,000 spectators and\ndespite losing to their first visiting team Liverpool, Manchester United were once again\nleague champions at the end of the first full season playing from Old Trafford.\nD\nThe following years were to be less of a success. From 1912 to the onset of the First World\nWar, no significant victories were achieved. During the war the football league was\nsuspended and only regional competitions took place. 1919 saw the return of Manchester\nUnited to league football with only two of the original members in the team.\nE\nAlthough Britain has a long and proud history of football adoration, contemporary football\nsupporters from the UK have gained a negative reputation for outbursts of violence against\nrival supporters, earning the label ‘football hooligan’. The football hooliganism phenomenon\nhas attracted the attention of a number of researchers and psychologists who have offered\n \n1\n\ntheories relating to its causes. It is generally agreed that a combination of factors may\ninitiate this type of anti-social behaviour and that it is unrealistic to contend that all such\nbehaviour stems from a particular psychological make-up or belongs to a specific age or\nclass. Experts do however believe that rampaging hooligan behaviour can instil a sense of\nbelonging and ‘community’ in participants who feel that they can strongly identify with their\ngroup, regardless of the fact that the group’s behaviour is negative.\nF\nAnalysts also argue that the motivations for outbursts of violence experienced in an\ninternational setting are even more complex. Whilst alcohol and xenophobia no doubt play\na part they say, some psychologists hold that policing tactics, to a large degree, dictate the\nlevel of disturbance likely to occur. Evidence supports the view that confrontational policing\nis much more likely to escalate than calm any incidences of trouble. The media’s actions\nhave also been criticised due to the belief by some that messages given in newspaper\nreporting may also exacerbate the existing problem of football hooliganism.\nG\nCritics say that certain headlines used by tabloid newspapers may glorify acts of violence\nand at least, the prolific news reports which are published in the UK about this issue cause\nperpetrators to receive undue attention and acknowledgement for their actions. Whilst few\ndisagree that football hooliganism is a significant social problem, many researchers hold\nthat sensationalist media reporting may also be creating undue panic since the problem is\noften presented as much more widespread than is the reality. Extreme cases of\nhooliganism from British fans has reduced significantly over recent years, and while it may\ntake some considerable time for the negative reputation they have earned to subside, it is\nalso true that a large proportion of supporters have no involvement in violence and simply\nshare a love of the game.\n \n2",
