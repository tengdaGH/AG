  "passage_text": "Reading Practice\n \nMan or Machine\nA\nDuring July 2003, the Museum of Science in Cambridge, Massachusetts exhibited what\nHonda calls ‘the world’s most advanced humanoid robot’, ASIMO (the Advanced Step in\nInnovative Mobility). Honda’s brainchild is on tour in North America and delighting\naudiences wherever it goes. After 17 years in the making, ASIMO stands at four feet tall,\nweighs around 115 pounds and looks like a child in an astronaut’s suit. Though it is difficult\nto see ASIMO’s face at a distance, on closer inspection it has a smile and two large ‘eyes’\nthat conceal cameras. The robot cannot work autonomously – its actions are ‘remote-\ncontrolled’ by scientists through the computer in its backpack. Yet watching AIMIO perform\nat a show in Massachusetts it seemed uncannily human. The audience cheered as ASIMO\nwalked forwards and backwards, side to side and up and downstairs. After the show, a\nnumber of people told me that they would like robots to play more of a role in daily life –\none even said that the robot would be like ‘another person’.\n \n \nB\nWhile the Japanese have made huge strides in solving some of the engineering problems\nof human kinetics and bipedal movements, for the past 10 years scientists at MIT’s former\nArtificial Intelligence (AI) lab (recently renamed the Computer Science and Artificial\nIntelligence Laboratory, CSAIL) have been making robots that can behave like humans and\ninteract with humans. One of MIT’s robots, Kismet, is an anthropomorphic head and has\ntwo eyes (complete with eyelids), ears, a mouth, and eyebrows. It has several facial\nexpressions, including happy, sad, frightened and disgusted. Human interlocutors are able\nto read some of the robot’s facial expressions, and often change their behavior towards the\nmachine as a result – for example, playing with it when it appears ‘sad’. Kismet is now in\nMIT’s museum, but the ideas developed here continue to be explored in new robots.\nC\nCog (short for Cognition) is another pioneering project from MIT’s former AI lab. Cog has a\nhead, eyes, two arms, hands and a torso – and its proportions were originally measured\nfrom the body of a researcher in the lab. The work on Cog has been used to test theories of\nembodiment and developmental robotics, particularly getting a robot to develop intelligence\nby responding to its environment via sensors, and to learn through these types of\ninteractions.\nD\nMIT is getting furthest down the road to creating human-like and interactive robots. Some\nscientists argue that ASIMO is a great engineering feat but not an intelligent machine –\nbecause it is unable to interact autonomously with unpredictabilities in its environment in\nmeaningful ways, and learn from experience. Robots like Cog and Kismet and new robots\nat MIT’s CSAIL and media lab, however, are beginning to do this.\nE\nThese are exciting developments. Creating a machine that can walk, make gestures and\n \n1\n\nlearn from its environment is an amazing achievement. And watch this space: these\nachievements are likely rapidly to be improved upon. Humanoid robots could have a\nplethora of uses in society, helping to free people from everyday tasks. In Japan, for\nexample, there is an aim to create robots that can do the tasks similar to an average\nhuman and also act in more sophisticated situations as firefighters, astronauts or medical\nassistants to the elderly in the workplace and in homes – partly in order to counterbalance\nthe effects of an ageing population.\nF\nSuch robots say much about the way in which we view humanity, and they bring out the\nbest and worst of us. On one hand, these developments express human creativity – our\nability to invent, experiment, and to extend our control over the world. On the other hand,\nthe aim to create a robot like a human being is spurred on by dehumanized ideas – by the\nsense that human companionship can be substituted by machines; that humans lose their\nhumanity when they interact with technology; or that we are a little more than surface and\nritual behaviors, that can be simulated with metal and electrical circuits. \n \n2",
