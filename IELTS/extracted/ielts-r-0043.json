  "passage_text": "Reading Practice\n \nA spark, a flint: How fire leapt to life\nThe control of fire was the first and perhaps greatest of humanity’s steps towards a\nlife-enhancing technology.\nTo early man, fire was a divine gift randomly delivered in the form of lightning, forest fire or\nburning lava. Unable to make flame for themselves, the earliest peoples probably stored\nfire by keeping slow burning logs alight or by carrying charcoal in pots.\nHow and where man learnt how to produce flame at will is unknown. It was probably a\nsecondary invention, accidentally made during tool-making operations with wood or stone.\nStudies of primitive societies suggest that the earliest method of making fire was through\nfriction. European peasants would insert a wooden drill in a round hole and rotate it briskly\nbetween their palms This process could be speeded up by wrapping a cord around the drill\nand pulling on each end.\nThe Ancient Greeks used lenses or concave mirrors to concentrate the sun’s rays and\nburning glasses were also used by Mexican Aztecs and the Chinese.\nPercussion methods of fire-lighting date back to Paleolithic times, when some Stone Age\ntool-makers discovered that chipping flints produced sparks. The technique became more\nefficient after the discovery of iron, about 5000 years ago In Arctic North America, the\nEskimos produced a slow-burning spark by striking quartz against iron pyrites, a compound\nthat contains sulphur. The Chinese lit their fires by striking porcelain with bamboo. In\nEurope, the combination of steel, flint and tinder remained the main method of fire-lighting\nuntil the mid 19th century.\nFire-lighting was revolutionised by the discovery of phosphorus, isolated in 1669 by a\nGerman alchemist trying to transmute silver into gold. Impressed by the element’s\ncombustibility, several 17th century chemists used it to manufacture fire-lighting devices,\nbut the results were dangerously inflammable. With phosphorus costing the equivalent of\nseveral hundred pounds per ounce, the first matches were expensive.\nThe quest for a practical match really began after 1781 when a group of French chemists\ncame up with the Phosphoric Candle or Ethereal Match, a sealed glass tube containing a\ntwist of paper tipped with phosphorus. When the tube was broken, air rushed in, causing\nthe phosphorus to self-combust. An even more hazardous device, popular in America, was\nthe Instantaneous Light Box — a bottle filled with sulphuric acid into which splints treated\nwith chemicals were dipped.\nThe first matches resembling those used today were made in 1827 by John Walker, an\nEnglish pharmacist who borrowed the formula from a military rocket-maker called\nCongreve. Costing a shilling a box, Congreves were splints coated with sulphur and tipped\nwith potassium chlorate. To light them, the user drew them quickly through folded glass\npaper.\nWalker never patented his invention, and three years later it was copied by a Samuel\nJones, who marketed his product as Lucifers. About the same time, a French chemistry\nstudent called Charles Sauria produced the first “strike-anywhere” match by substituting\nwhite phosphorus for the potassium chlorate in the Walker formula. However, since white\n \n1\n\nphosphorus is a deadly poison, from 1845 match-makers exposed to its fumes succumbed\nto necrosis, a disease that eats away jaw-bones. It wasn’t until 1906 that the substance\nwas eventually banned. \nThat was 62 years after a Swedish chemist called Pasch had discovered non-toxic red or\namorphous phosphorus, a development exploited commercially by Pasch’s compatriot J E\nLundstrom in 1885. Lundstrom’s safety matches were safe because the red phosphorus\nwas non-toxic; it was painted on to the striking surface instead of the match tip, which\ncontained potassium chlorate with a relatively high ignition temperature of 182 degrees\ncentigrade.\nAmerica lagged behind Europe in match technology and safety standards. It wasn’t until\n1900 that the Diamond Match Company bought a French patent for safety matches — but\nthe formula did not work properly in the different climatic conditions prevailing in America\nand it was another 11 years before scientists finally adapted the French patent for the US.\nThe Americans, however, can claim several “firsts” in match technology and marketing. In\n1892 the Diamond Match Company pioneered book matches. The innovation didn’t catch\non until after 1896, when a brewery had the novel idea of advertising its product in match\nbooks. Today book matches are the most widely used type in the US, with 90 percent\nhanded out free by hotels, restaurants and others.\n \nOther American innovations include an anti-after-glow solution to prevent the match from\nsmouldering after it has been blown out; and the waterproof match, which lights after eight\nhours in water.\n \n2",
