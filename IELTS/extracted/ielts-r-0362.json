  "passage_text": "Reading Practice\n \n \nReclaiming the future of aral sea\n \nA The Aral Sea gets almost all its water from the Amu and Syr rivers. Over millennium the\nAmu’s course has drifted away from the sea, causing it to shrink. But the lake always\nrebounded as the Amu shifted back again. Today heavy irrigation for crops such as cotton\nand rice siphons off much of the two rivers, severely cutting flow into their deltas and thus\ninto the sea. Evaporation vastly outpaces any rainfall, snowmelt or groundwater supply,\nreducing water volume and raising salinity. The Soviet Union hid the sea’s demise for\ndecades until 1985, when leader Mikhail Gorbachev revealed the great environmental and\nhuman tragedy. By the late 1980s the sea’s level had dropped so much that the water had\nseparated into two distinct bodies: the Small Aral (north) and the Large Aral (south). By\n2007 the south had split into a deep western basin, a shallow eastern basin and a small,\nisolated gulf. The Large Aral’s volume had dropped from 708 to only 75 cubic kilometers\n(km3), and salinity had risen from 14 to more than 100 grams per liter (g/1). The 1991\ndissolution of the Soviet Union divided the lake between newly formed Kazakhstan and\nUzbekistan, ending a grand Soviet plan to channel in water from distant Siberian rivers and\nestablishing competition for the dwindling resource.\n \nB Desiccation of the Aral Sea has wrought severe consequences. Greatly reduced river\nflows ended the spring floods that sustained wetlands with freshwater and enriched\nsediment. Fish species in the lakes dropped from 32 to 6 because of rising salinity and loss\nof spawning and feeding grounds (most survived in the river deltas). Commercial fisheries,\nwhich caught 40,000 metric tons of fish in 1960, were gone by the mid-1980s; more than\n60,000 related jobs were lost. The most common\nremaining lake occupant was the Black Sea flounder, a saltwater fish introduced in the\n1970s, but by 2003 it had disappeared from the southern lakes because salinity was more\nthan 70 g/1, double that of a typical ocean. Shipping on the Aral also ceased because the\nwater receded many kilometers from the major ports of Aralsk to the north and Moynak in\nthe south; keeping increasingly long channels open to the cities became too costly.\nGroundwater levels dropped with falling lake levels, intensifying desertification.\n \nC The receding sea has exposed and dried 54,000 square kilometers of seabed, which is\nchoked with salt and in some places laced with pesticides and other agricultural chemicals\ndeposited by runoff from area farming. Strong windstorms blow salt, dust and contaminants\nas far as 500 km. Winds from the north and northeast drive the most severe storms,\nseriously impacting the Amu delta to the south—the most densely settled and most\neconomically and ecologically important area in the region. Afrbome sodium bicarbonate,\nsodium chloride and sodium sulfate kill or retard the growth of natural vegetation and\ncrops—a cruel irony given that irrigating those crops starves the sea. Health experts say\nthe local population suffers from high levels of respiratory illnesses, throat and esophageal\ncancer, and digestive disorders caused by breathing and ingesting salt-laden air and water.\nLiver and kidney ailments, as well as eye problems, are common. The loss of fish has also\ngreatly reduced dietary variety, worsening malnutrition and anemia, particularly in pregnant\nwomen.\nD Returning the entire Aral Sea to its 1960s state is unrealistic. The annual inflow from the\nSyr and Amu rivers would have to be quadrupled from the recent average of 13 km3. The\nonly means would be to curtail irrigation, which accounts for 92 percent of water\nwithdrawals. Yet four of the five former Soviet republics in the Aral Sea basin (Kazakhstan\n \n1\n\nis the exception) intend to expand irrigation, mainly to feed growing populations. Switching\nto less water- intensive crops, such as replacing cotton with winter wheat, could help, but\nthe two primary irrigating nations, Uzbekistan and Turkmenistan, intend to keep cotton to\nearn foreign currency. The extensive irrigation canals could be greatly improved; many are\nsimply cuts through sand, and they allow enormous quantities of water to seep away.\nModernizing the entire system could save 12 km3 a year but would cost at least $16 billion.\nThe basin states do not have the money or the political will. Kazakhstan has nonetheless\ntried to partially restore the northern Aral.\n \nE We expect salinities in the Small Aral to settle at three to 14 g/1, depending on location.\nAt these levels many more indigenous species should return, although the saltwater\nkambala would disappear from most places. Further restoration is possible. For example, if\nirrigation improvements raised the average annual inflow from the Syr to 4.5 km3, which is\nentirely feasible, the lake’s level could stabilize at about 47 meters. This change would\nbring the shoreline to within eight kilometers of Aralsk, the former major port city, close\nenough to allow recovery of an earlier channel that connected the city to the receding\nwaters. The channel would give large commercial fishing vessels access to the sea, and\nshipping could restart. Marshlands and fish populations would improve even more because\nof a further reduction in salinity. Outflow to the southern lakes could also increase, helping\nthen restoration. Such a plan would require a much longer and higher dike, as well as\nreconstruction of the gate facility, and it is not clear that Kazakhstan has the means or\ndesire to pursue it. The country is, however, now discussing more modest proposals to\nbring water closer to Aralsk.\nF The Large Aral faces a difficult future; it continues to shrink rapidly. Only a long, narrow\nchannel connects the shallow eastern basin and the deeper western basin, and this could\nclose altogether. If countries along the Amu make no changes, we estimate that at current\nrates of groundwater in and evaporation out, an isolated eastern basin would stabilize at an\narea of 4,300 square kilometers (km2). But it would average only 2.5 meters deep. Salinity\nwould exceed 100 g/1, possibly reaching 200 g/1; the only creatures that could live in it\nwould be brine shrimp and bacteria. The western basin’s fate depends on ground- water\ninflow, estimates for which are uncertain. Someone has noted numerous fresh- water\nsprings on the western cliffs. The most reliable calculations indicate that the basin would\nsettle at about 2,100 km2. The lake would still be relatively deep, reaching 37 meters in\nspots, but salinity would rise well above 100 g/1.\n \n2",
