  "passage_text": "Reading Practice\n \nStriking Back at Lightning With Lasers\nSeldom is the weather more dramatic than when thunderstorms strike. Their electrical fury\ninflicts death or serious injury on around 500 people each year in the United States alone.\nAs the clouds roll in, a leisurely round of golf can become a terrifying dice with death - out\nin the open, a lone golfer may be a lightning bolt’s most inviting target. And there is\ndamage to property too. Lightning damage costs American power companies more than\n$100 million a year.\nBut researchers in the United States and Japan are planning to hit back. Already in\nlaboratory trials they have tested strategies for neutralising the power of thunderstorms,\nand this winter they will brave real storms, equipped with an armoury of lasers that they will\nbe pointing towards the heavens to discharge thunderclouds before lightning can strike.\nThe idea of forcing storm clouds to discharge their lightning on command is not new. In the\nearly 1960s, researchers tried firing rockets trailing wires into thunderclouds to set up\nan easy discharge path for the huge electric charges that these clouds generate. The\ntechnique survives to this day at a test site in Florida run by the University of Florida, with\nsupport from the Electrical Power Research Institute (EPRI), based in California. EPRI,\nwhich is funded by power companies, is looking at ways to protect the United States’ power\ngrid from lightning strikes. ‘We can cause the lightning to strike where we want it to using\nrockets,’ says Ralph Bernstein, manager of lightning projects at EPRI. The rocket site is\nproviding precise measurements of lightning voltages and allowing engineers to check how\nelectrical equipment bears up.\nBad behaviour\nBut while rockets are fine for research, they cannot provide the protection from lightning\nstrikes that everyone is looking for. The rockets cost around $1,200 each, can only be\nfired at a limited frequency and their failure rate is about 40 per cent. And even when they\ndo trigger lightning, things still do not always go according to plan. ‘Lightning is not\nperfectly well behaved,’ says Bernstein. ‘Occasionally, it will take a branch and go\nsomeplace it wasn’t supposed to go.’\nAnd anyway, who would want to fire streams of rockets in a populated area? ‘What goes up\nmust come down,’ points out Jean-Claude Diels of the University of New Mexico. Diels\nis leading a project, which is backed by EPRI, to try to use lasers to discharge lightning\nsafely- and safety is a basic requirement since no one wants to put themselves or their\nexpensive equipment at risk. With around $500,000 invested so far, a promising system is\njust emerging from the laboratory.\nThe idea began some 20 years ago, when high-powered lasers were revealing their ability\nto extract electrons out of atoms and create ions. If a laser could generate a line of\nionisation in the air all the way up to a storm cloud, this conducting path could be used to\nguide lightning to Earth, before the electric field becomes strong enough to break down the\nair in an uncontrollable surge. To stop the laser itself being struck, it would not be pointed\nstraight at the clouds. Instead it would be directed at a mirror, and from there into the sky.\nThe mirror would be protected by placing lightning conductors close by. Ideally, the cloud-\nzapper (gun) would be cheap enough to be installed around all key power installations, and\nportable enough to be taken to international sporting events to beam up at brewing storm\n \n1\n\nclouds.\nA stumbling block\nHowever, there is still a big stumbling block. The laser is no nifty portable: it’s a monster\nthat takes up a whole room. Diels is trying to cut down the size and says that a laser\naround the size of a small table is in the offing. He plans to test this more manageable\nsystem on live thunderclouds next summer. Bernstein says that Diels’s system is attracting\nlots of interest from the power companies.\nBut they have not yet come up with the $5 million that EPRI says will be needed to develop\na commercial system, by making the lasers yet smaller and cheaper. I cannot say I have\nmoney yet, but I’m working on it,’ says Bernstein. He reckons that the forthcoming field\ntests will be the turning point - and he’s hoping for good news. Bernstein predicts ‘an\navalanche of interest and support’ if all goes well. He expects to see cloud-zappers\neventually costing $50,000 to $100,000 each.\nOther scientists could also benefit. With a lightning ‘switch’ at their fingertips, materials\nscientists could find out what happens when mighty currents meet matter. Diels also hopes\nto see the birth of ‘interactive meteorology’ - not just forecasting the weather but controlling\nit. ‘If we could discharge clouds, we might affect the weather,’ he says.\nAnd perhaps, says Diels, we’ll be able to confront some other meteorological menaces.\n‘We think we could prevent hail by inducing lightning,’ he says. Thunder, the shock wave\nthat comes from a lightning flash, is thought to be the trigger for the torrential rain that is\ntypical of storms. A laser thunder factory could shake the moisture out of clouds, perhaps\npreventing the formation of the giant hailstones that threaten crops. With luck, as the storm\nclouds gather this winter, laser-toting researchers could, for the first time, strike back.\n \n2",
