  "passage_text": "Reading Practice\n \nFUELING THE FUTURE\nThe world’s 750 million motor vehicles emit well over 900 million metric tonnes of carbon\ndioxide each year. Traffic-related air pollution has been responsible for 6% of deaths per\nyear and is associated with certain forms of leukaemia, inflammatory lung diseases,\nincreased cardio-vascular disease, low birth-weight babies and male infertility. It stands to\nreason that tackling traffic- related air pollution should be high on any government’s list of\npriorities. Thus, in an attempt to minimise this situation many governments around the\nworld have been looking at ways to implement alternative fuel sources. The most widely\naccepted way of doing this is to replace the crude oil that our vehicles currently run on with\nrenewable, ‘environmentally friendly’ One serious contender put forward as a solution to\nthe pollution problem is ethanol.\nEthanol is a type of alcohol made by fermenting plant material. Water and organic matter\nfrom the plants including com, sorghum, sugar cane and wood are mixed together and\nfermented to make ethanol. After fermentation there are three layers remaining. The first is\nwater and small particles of grain and alcohol. It takes on a syrup consistency. The second\nlayer is the remaining grain, which is 17 per cent dry matter. The third layer is the actual\nethanol – a colourless, volatile, flammable liquid. It is the only layer sold and accounts for\nexactly one-third of the total dry matter used for its production. There are three primary\nways that it is used as a fuel for transportation: as a blend of 10 per cent ethanol with 90%\nunleaded fuel (E10); as a component of reformulated gasoline and; as a primary fuel with\n85 parts of ethanol blended with 15 parts of unleaded fuel (E-85). In the 1800s in the USA,\nit was first used as lamp fuel. Later on, due to skyrocketing oil prices in the 1970s, E10 was\nproduced as a type of ‘fuel-extender’ for vehicles with E-85 being produced in the 1990s.\nBrazil has also used ethanol-blended fuels. Like America, the high prices in the 1970s\nprompted a government mandate to produce vehicles which could be fuelled by pure\nethanol Today there are more than 4,2 million ethanol- powered vehicles in Brazil (40 per\ncent passenger carrying) which consume 4 billion gallons of ethanol annually. Today, Brazil\nis the largest transportation ethanol fuel market in the world.\nGiven that Ethanol is made from a variety of plant substances when it is used in fuel\nproduction, it increases the monetary value of feed grains grown by farmers. In fact, in the\nUSA, the largest ethanol consuming nation in the world, ethanol production adds £4.5\nbillion to the farm economy every year. According to the United States Department of\nAgriculture, ethanol production adds 30 cents to the value of a bushel of corn. Another of\nits benefits, according to Brian Keating, deputy chief of Australia’s Commonwealth\nScientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO) is that a 10% ethanol blend (E10)\nwould reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 2 to 5% over the full lifecycle of ethanol\nproduction and consumption. Said Keating, “The precise benefits depend on specific\nfactors in the production cycle. An important component of which is the energy source used\nby the ethanol factory. If it’s being powered by coal or oil, there are obviously associated\ngreenhouse gas emissions.” In America, The Clean Air Act of 1990 and the National\nEnergy Policy Act of 1992 have both created new market opportunities for cleaner, more\nefficient fuels with many state governments in America’s Mid-west purchasing fleet vehicles\ncapable of running on E-85 fuels.\nAlthough it makes a good fuel, some drawbacks have been documented. The economics of\nethanol production are improving as the technology improves but ethanol has two\n \n1\n\nproblems: It does not explode like gasoline, and it can absorb water, which can cause\noxidation, rust and corrosion. The claims of possible damage to vehicles from the use of\nethanol blends above 10% has therefore attracted considerable negative publicity.\nCompared to diesel – the standard fuel in the heavy moving industry – ethanol is known to\nhave a lower energy content so ethanol trucks require larger fuel tanks to achieve the same\nrange as a diesel-powered vehicle. In Australia, a government review’ into the impacts of a\n20% ethanol blend on vehicles found the information to be insufficient or conflicting, but did\nidentify a number of problems such as the possible perishing and swelling of elastomeric\nand plastic materials in fuel systems. Stakeholders in the motor vehicle industry have\nslated that warranties on motor vehicles and pump dispensing equipment could be at risk\nwith the use of blends above 10% ethanol. Principle economist for the Australian Bureau of\nAgriculture Andrew Dickson points out that the money sugarcane growers get for their cane\nis not determined by the domestic consumption or domestic demand for ethanol, it is\nentirely determined by the world sugar market and the world trade in molasses He believes\nthat the only way the sugar industry’ can benefit from the existence of an ethanol industry is\nif they invest in the ethanol industry. “The sugar producer does not get any more money for\ntheir molasses so what incentive do they have to produce any more?.” The cost of\nproduction also represents some challenges. In Australia, fuel ethanol costs around 70\ncents per litre compared with around 35 cents per litre for unleaded petrol. In America, one\nreport revealed that even with government assistance, ethanol is dose to 35 per cent more\nthan the price of diesel. Consequently, production of ethanol requires government\nassistance to be competitive. A recent study by the Australian Bureau of Agricultural and\nResource Economies found that without assistance, large-scale production of ethanol\nwould not be commercially viable in Australia.\nRegardless of whether the Australian sugar industry will benefit from a mandated 10%\nethanol mix, the expansion of ethanol production would certainly lead to increased\neconomic activity in farming areas. It is inevitable that some expansion would be at the\nexpense of existing industry. If ethanol becomes more popular, there will soon be more\nplants producing it. This means there will be a need for workers for the plants. The\nAmerican National Ethanol Vehicle Coalition (NBVC) projects that employment will be\nboosted by 200,000 jobs and the balance of trade will be improved by over $2 The future of\nethanol looks promising, for better or worse ethanol looks to be a serious contender for\ntomorrow’s fuel.\n \n2",
