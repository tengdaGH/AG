  "passage_text": "Reading Practice\n \nGreen virtues of green sand\n \nRevolution in gloss recycling could help keep water clean\nA For the past 100 years special high grade white sand dug from the ground at\nLeighton Buzzard in the UK. has been used to filter tap water to remove bacteria and\nimpurities but this may no longer be necessary. A new factory that turns used wine\nbottles into green sand could revolutionise the recycling industry and help to filter\nBritain’s drinking water. Backed by $1.6m from the European Union and the\nDepartment for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra), a company based in\nScotland is building the factory, which will turn beverage bottles back into the sand\nfrom which they were made in the first place. The green sand has already been\nsuccessfully tested by water companies and is being used in 50 swimming pools in\nScotland to keep the water clean.\nB The idea is not only to avoid using up an increasingly scarce natural resource,\nsand but also to solve a crisis in the recycling industry. Britain uses 5.5m tonnes of\nglass a year, but recycles only 750,000 tonnes of it. The problem is that half the\ngreen bottle glass in Britain is originally from imported wine and beer bottles.\nBecause there is so much of it, and it is used less in domestic production than other\ntypes, green glass is worth only $25 a tonne. Clear glass, which is melted down and\nused for whisky bottles, mainly for export, is worth double that amount.\nC Howard Drvden. a scientist and managing director of the company. Drvden Aqua,\nof Bonnyrigg, near Edinburgh, has spent six years working on the product he calls\nActive Filtration Media, or AFM. He concedes that he has given what is basically\nrecycled glass a ‘fancy name' to remove the stigma of what most people would\nregard as an inferior product. He says he needs bottles that have already contained\ndrinkable liquids to be sure that drinking water filtered through the AFM would not\nbe contaminated. Crushed down beverage glass has fewer impurities than real sand\nand it performed better in trials. *The fact is that tests show that AFM does the job\nbetter than sand, it is easier to clean and reuse and has all sorts of properties that make it\nideal for other applications.' he claimed.\nD The factory is designed to produce 100 tonnes of AFM a day, although Mr Dryden\nregards this as a large-scale pilot project rather than full production. Current\nestimates of the UK market for this glass for filtering drinking water, sewage,\nindustrial water, swimming pools and fish farming are between 175.000 to 217.000\ntonnes a year, which w ill use up most of the glass available near the factory. So he\nintends to build five or six factories in cities where there are large quantities of\nbottles, in order to cut down on transport costs.\nE The current factory will be completed this month and is expected to go into full\nproduction on January 14th next year. Once it is providing a ‘regular’ product, the\ngovernment’s drinking water inspectorate will be asked to perform tests and\napprove it for widespread use by water companies. A Defra spokesman said it was\nhoped that AFM could meet approval within six months. The only problem that they\ncould foresee was possible contamination if some glass came from sources other\nthan beverage bottles.\n1\n\nF Among those who have tested the glass already is Caroline Fitzpatrick of the civil\nand environmental engineering department of University College London. ‘We have\nlooked at a number of batches and it appears to do the job.' she said. ‘Basically,\nsand is made of glass and Mr Dryden is turning bottles back into sand. It seems a\nstraightforward idea and there is no reason we can think of why it would not work.\nSince glass from wine bottles and other beverages has no impurities and clearly did\nnot leach any substances into the contents of the bottles, there was no reason to\nbelieve there would be a problem,’ Dr Fitzpatrick added.\nG Mr Dryden has set up a network of agents round the world to sell AFM. It is already\nin use in central America to filter water on banana plantations where the fruit has to\nhe washed before being despatched to European markets. It is also in use in sewage\nworks to filter water before it is returned to rivers, something which is becoming\nlegally necessary across the European Union because of tighter regulations on\nsewage works. So there are a great number of applications involving cleaning up\nwater. Currently, however, AFM costs $670 a tonne, about four times as much as\ngood quality sand. ‘Hut that is because we haven't got large-scale production.\nObviously, when we get going it will cost a lot less, and be competitive with sand in\nprice as well.’ Mr Dryden said. ‘I believe it performs better and lasts longer than\nsand, so it is going to be better value too.'\nH If AFM takes off as a product it will be a big boost for the government agency\nwhich is charged with finding a market for recycled products. Crushed glass is\nalready being used in road surfacing and in making tiles and bricks. Similarly. AFM\ncould prove to have a widespread use and give green glass a cash value.\n2",
