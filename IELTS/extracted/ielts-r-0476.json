  "passage_text": "Reading Practice\n \nThe Fruit Book\n \nIt’s not every scientist who writes books for people who can’t read. And how many\nscientists want their books to look as dog-eared as possible? But Patricia Shanley, an\nethnobotanist, wanted to give something back. After the poorest people of the Amazon\nallowed her to study their land and its ecology, she turned her research findings into a\npicture book that tells the local people how to get a good return on their trees without\nsuccumbing to the lure of a quick buck from a logging company. It has proved a big\nsuccess.\n \nA The book is called Fruit Trees and Useful Plants in the Lives of Amazonians, but is better\nknown simply as the “fruit book”. The second edition was produced at the request of\npoliticians in western Amazonia. Its blend of hard science and local knowledge on the use\nand trade of 35 native forest species has been so well received (and well used) that no less\na dignitary than Brazil’s environment minister, Marina Silva, has written the foreword.\n“There is nothing else like the Shanley book,” says Adalberto Verrisimo, director of the\nInstitute of People and the Environment of the Amazon. “It gives science back to the poor,\nto the people who really need it.”\n \nB Shanley’s work on the book began a decade ago, with a plea for help from the Rural\nWorkers’ Union of Paragominas, a Brazilian town whose prosperity is based on exploitation\nof timber. The union realised that logging companies would soon be knocking on the doors\nof the caboclos, peasant farmers living on the Rio Capim, an Amazon tributary in the\nBrazilian state of Para. Isolated and illiterate, the caboclos would have little concept of the\ntrue value of their trees; communities downstream had already sold off large blocks of\nforest for a pittance. “What they wanted to know was how valuable the forests were,”\nrecalls Shanley, then a researcher in the area for the Massachusetts-based Woods Hole\nResearch Centre.\n \nC The Rural Workers’ Union wanted to know whether harvesting wild fruits would make\neconomic sense in the Rio Capim. “There was a lot of interest in trading non-timber forest\nproducts (NTFPs),” Shanley says. At the time, environmental groups and green-minded\nbusinesses were promoting the idea. This was the view presented in a seminal paper,\nValuation of an Amazonian Rainforest, published in Nature in 1989. The researchers had\ncalculated that revenues from the sale of fruits could far exceed those from a one- off sale\nof trees to loggers. “The union was keen to discover whether it made more sense\nconserving the forest for subsistence use and the possible sale of fruit, game and medicinal\nplants, than selling trees for timber,” says Shanley. Whether it would work for the caboclos\nwas far from clear.\nD Although Shanley had been invited to work in the Rio Capim, some caboclos were\nsuspicious. “When Patricia asked if she could study my forest,” says Joao Fernando\nMoreira Brito, \"my neighbours said she was a foreigner who’d come to rob me of my trees.\"\nIn the end, Moreira Brito, or Mangueira as he is known, welcomed Shanley and worked on\nher study. His land, an hour's walk from the Rio Capim, is almost entirely covered with\nprimary forest. A study of this and other tracts of forest selected by the communities\nenabled Shanley to identify three trees, found throughout the Amazon, whose fruit was\nmuch favoured by the caboclos: bacuri (Platonia insignis), uxi (Endop- leura uchi) and\npiquia (Cayocas villosum). The caboclos used their fruits, extracted oils, and knew what\n \n1\n\n \nsort of wildlife they attracted. But, in the face of aggressive tactics from the logging\ncompanies, they had no measure of the trees' financial worth. The only way to find out,\nShanley decided, was to start from scratch with a scientific study. “From a scientific point of\nview, hardly anything was known about these trees,” she says. But six years of field\nresearch yielded a mass of data on their flowering and fruiting behaviour. During 1993 and\n1994, 30 families weighed everything they used from the forest - game, fruit, fibre,\nmedicinal plants - and documented its source.\n \nE After three logging sales and a major fire in 1997, the researchers were also able to\nstudy the ecosystem's reaction to logging and disturbance. They carried out a similar,\nthough less exhaustive, study in 1999, this time with 15 families. The changes were\nstriking. Average annual household consumption of forest fruit had fallen from 89 to 28\nkilogrammes between 1993 and 1999. “What we found,” says Shanley, “was that fruit\ncollection could coexist with a certain amount of logging, but after the forest fire it dropped\ndramatically.” Over the same period, fibre use also dropped from around 20 to 4\nkilogrammes. The fire and logging also changed the nature of the caboclo diet. In 1993\nmost households ate game two or three times a month. By 1999 some were fortunate if\nthey ate game more than two or three times a year. \n \nF The loss of certain species of tree was especially significant. Shanley’s team persuaded\nlocal hunters to weigh their catch, noting the trees under which the animals were caught.\nOver the year, they trapped five species of game averaging 232 kilogrammes under piquia\ntrees. Under copaiba, they caught just two species averaging 63 kilogrammes; and under\nuxi, four species weighing 38 kilogrammes. At last, the team was getting a handle on which\ntrees were worth keeping, and which could reasonably be sold. “This showed that selling\npiquia trees to loggers for a few dollars made little sense,” explains Shanley. “Their local\nvalue lies in providing a prized fruit, as well as flowers which attract more game than any\nother species.”\n \nG As a result of these studies, Shanley had to tell the Rural Workers’ Union of\nParagominas that the Nature thesis could not be applied wholesale to their community -\nharvesting NTFPs would not always yield more than timber sales. Fruiting patterns of trees\nsuch as uxi were unpredictable, for example. In 1994, one household collected 3,654 uxi\nfruits; the following year, none at all.\n \nH This is not to say that wild fruit trees were unimportant. On the contrary, argues Shanley,\nthey are critical for subsistence, something that is often ignored in much of the current\nresearch on NTFPs, which tends to focus on their commercial potential. Geography was\nanother factor preventing the Rio Capim caboclos from establishing a serious trade in wild\nfruit: villagers in remote areas could not compete with communities collecting NTFPs close\nto urban markets, although they could sell them to passing river boats.\nI But Shanley and her colleagues decided to do more than just report their results to the\nunion. Together with two of her research colleagues, Shanley wrote the fruit book. This, the\nBible and a publication on medicinal plants co-authored by Shanley and designed for\npeople with minimal literacy skills are about the only books you will see along this stretch of\nthe Rio Capim. The first print ran to only 3,000 copies, but the fruit book has been\nremarkably influential, and is used by colleges, peasant unions, industries and the caboclos\nthemselves. Its success is largely due to the fact that people with poor literacy skills can\nunderstand much of the information it contains about the non-timber forest products, thanks\nto its illustrations, anecdotes, stories and songs. “The book doesn’t tell people what to do,”\n \n2\n\nsays Shanley, “but it does provide them with choices.” The caboclos who have used the\nbook now have a much better understanding of which trees to sell to the loggers, and\nwhich to protect.  \n \n3",
