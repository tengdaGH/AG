  "passage_text": "Reading Practice\n \n \nSleep helps reduce errors in memory\n \n \nSleep may reduce mistakes in memory, according to a first-of-its-kind study led by a\nscientist at Michigan State University.\n \n \n \nThe findings, which appear in the September issue of the journal Learning El Memory,\nhave practical implications for many people, from students doing multiple-choice tests to\nelderly people confusing their medicine, says Kimberly Fenn, principal investigator and\nassistant professor of psychology.\n \n \n \n \n \n‘It’s easy to muddle things in your mind,’ Fenn says. This research suggests that after\nsleep, you’re better able to pick out the incorrect parts of that memory.’ Fenn and\ncolleagues from the University of Chicago and Washington University in St Louis studied\nthe presence of incorrect or false memory in groups of college students. While previous\nresearch has shown that sleep improves memory, this study is the first one that looks at\nerrors in memory, she said.\n \nStudy participants were ‘trained’ by being shown or listening to lists of words. Then, twelve\nhours later, they were shown individual words and asked to identify which words they had\nseen or heard in the earlier session. One group of students was trained at 10 a.m. and\ntested at 10 p.m. after the course of a normal sleepless day. Another group was trained at\nnight and tested twelve hours later in the morning, after about six hours of sleep. Three\nexperiments were conducted. In each experiment, the results showed that students who\nhad slept did not have as many problems with false memory and chose fewer incorrect\nwords.\nHow does sleep help? The answer isn’t known, Fenn said, but she suspects it may be due\nto sleep strengthening the source of the memory. The source, or context in which the\ninformation is acquired, is a vital element of the memory process.\nIn other words, it may be easier to remember something if you can also remember where\nyou first heard or saw it. Or perhaps the people who didn’t sleep as much during the study\nreceived so much other information during the day that this affected their memory ability,\nFenn said.\nFurther research is needed, she said, adding that she plans to study different population\ngroups, particularly the elderly. ‘We know older individuals generally have worse memory\nperformance than younger individuals.\nWe also know from other research that elderly individuals tend to be more prone to false\nmemories,’ Fenn said. ‘Given the work we’ve done, it’s possible that sleep may actually\nhelp them to reject this false information. And potentially this could help to improve their\nquality of life.’\n \n1",
