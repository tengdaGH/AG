  "passage_text": "Reading Practice\n \nThe meaning and power of smell\nThe sense of smell, or olfaction, is powerful. Odours affect us on a physical, psychological\nand social level. For the most part, however, we breathe in the aromas which surround us\nwithout being consciously aware of their importance to us. It is only when the faculty of\nsmell is impaired for some reason that we begin to realise the essential role the sense of\nsmell plays in our sense of well-being\nA\nA survey conducted by Anthony Synott at Montreal’s Concordia University asked\nparticipants to comment on how important smell was to them in their lives. It became\napparent that smell can evoke strong emotional responses. A scent associated with a good\nexperience can bring a rush of joy, while a foul odour or one associated with a bad memory\nmay make us grimace with disgust. Respondents to the survey noted that many of their\nolfactory likes and dislikes were based on emotional associations. Such associations can\nbe powerful enough so that odours that we would generally label unpleasant become\nagreeable, and those that we would generally consider fragrant become disagreeable for\nparticular individuals. The perception of smell, therefore, consists not only of the sensation\nof the odours themselves, but of the experiences and emotions associated with them.\nB\nOdours are also essential cues in social bonding. One respondent to the survey believed\nthat there is no true emotional bonding without touching and smelling a loved one. In fact,\ninfants recognise the odours of their mothers soon after birth and adults can often identify\ntheir children or spouses by scent. In one well-known test, women and men were able to\ndistinguish by smell alone clothing worn by their marriage partners from similar clothing\nworn by other people. Most of the subjects would probably never have given much thought\nto odour as a cue for identifying family members before being involved in the test, but as\nthe experiment revealed, even when not consciously considered, smells register.\nC\nIn spite of its importance to our emotional and sensory lives, smell is probably the most\nundervalued sense in many cultures. The reason often given for the low regard in which\nsmell is held is that, in comparison with its importance among animals, the human sense of\nsmell is feeble and undeveloped. While it is true that the olfactory powers of humans are\nnothing like as fine as those possessed by certain animals, they are still remarkably acute.\nOur noses are able to recognise thousands of smells, and to perceive odours which are\npresent only in extremely small quantities.\nD\nSmell, however, is a highly elusive phenomenon. Odours, unlike colours, for instance,\ncannot be named in many languages because the specific vocabulary simply doesn’t exist.\n‘It smells like . . . ,’ we have to say when describing an odour, struggling to express our\nolfactory experience. Nor can odours be recorded: there is no effective way to either\ncapture or store them over time. In the realm of olfaction, we must make do with\ndescriptions and recollections. This has implications for olfactory research.\n \n1\n\nE\nMost of the research on smell undertaken to date has been of a physical scientific nature.\nSignificant advances have been made in the understanding of the biological and chemical\nnature of olfaction, but many fundamental questions have yet to be answered. Researchers\nhave still to decide whether smell is one sense or two - one responding to odours proper\nand the other registering odourless chemicals in the air. Other unanswered questions are\nwhether the nose is the only part of the body affected by odours, and how smells can be\nmeasured objectively given the nonphysical components. Questions like these mean that\ninterest in the psychology of smell is inevitably set to play an increasingly important role for\nresearchers.\nF\nHowever, smell is not simply a biological and psychological phenomenon. Smell is cultural,\nhence it is a social and historical phenomenon. Odours are invested with cultural values:\nsmells that are considered to be offensive in some cultures may be perfectly acceptable in\nothers. Therefore, our sense of smell is a means of, and model for, interacting with the\nworld. Different smells can provide us with intimate and emotionally charged experiences\nand the value that we attach to these experiences is interiorised by the members of society\nin a deeply personal way. Importantly, our commonly held feelings about smells can help\ndistinguish us from other cultures. The study of the cultural history of smell is, therefore, in\na very real sense, an investigation into the essence of human culture.\n \n2",
