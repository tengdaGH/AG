New research has the answer, writes Alexandra\nWitze.\nA. You probably pay more attention to a newspaper with your eyes than with your nose.\nBut lift the paper to your nostrils and inhale. The smell of newsprint might carry you back to\nyour childhood, when your parents perused the paper on Sunday mornings. Or maybe\nsome other smell takes you back-the scent of your mother’s perfume, the pungency of a\ndriftwood campfire. Specific odours can spark a flood of reminiscences.\n \nPsychologists call it the “Proustian phenomeno” after French novelist Marcel Proust. Near\nthe beginning of the masterpiece In Search of Lost Time, Proust’s narrator dunks a\nmadeleine cookie into a cup of tea and the scent and taste unleash a torrent of childhood\nmemories for 3000 pages.\nB. Now, this phenomenon is getting the scientific treatment. Neuroscientists Rachel Herz, a\ncognitive neuroscientist at Brown University in Providence, Rhode Island, have discovered,\nfor instance, how sensory memories are shared across the brain, with different brain\nregions remembering the sights, smells, tastes and sounds of a particular experience.\nMeanwhile, psychologists have demonstrated that memories triggered by smells can be\nmore emotional, as well as more detailed, than memories not related to smells.\nWhen you inhale, odour molecules set brain cells dancing within a region known as the\nimygdala ( E ) , a part of the brain that helps control emotion. In contrast, the other senses,\nsuch as taste or touch, get routed through other parts of the brain before reaching the\namygdala. The direct link between odours and the amygdala may help explain the\nemotional potency of smells. ’’There is this unique connection between the sense of smell\nand the part of the brain that processes emotion,” says Rachel Herz.\nC. But the links don’t stop there. Like an octopus reaching its tentacles outward, the\nmemory of smells affects other brain regions as well. In recent experiments, neuroscientists\nat University College London (UCL) asked 15 volunteers to look at pictures while smelling\nunrelated odours. For instance, the subjects might see a photo of a duck paired with the\nscent of a rose, and then be asked to create a story linking the two.\n \nBrain scans taken at the time revealed that the volunteers’ brains were particularly active in\na region known as the factory cortex, which is known to be involved in processing smells.\nFive minutes later, the volunteers were shown the duck photo again, but without the rose\nsmell. And in their brains, the olfactory cortex lit up again, the scientists reported recently.\nThe fact that the olfactory cortex became active in the absence of the odour suggests that\npeople’s sensory memory of events is spread across different brain regions.\nImagine going on a seaside holiday, says UCL team leader, Jay Gottfried. The sight of the\nwaves becomes stored in one area, whereas the crash of the surf goes elsewhere, and the\n \n1\n\nsmell of seaweed in yet another place. There could be advantageous to having memories\nspread around the brain. ’’You can reawaken that memory from any one of the sensory\ntriggers,” says Gottfried. “Maybe the smell of the sun lotion, or a particular sound from that\nday, or the sight of a rock formation.” Or – in the case of an early hunter and gatherer (out\non a plain – the sight of a lion might be enough to trigger the urge to flee, rather than\nhaving to wait for the sound of its roar and the stench of its hide to kick in as well.\n \nD. Remembered smells may also carry extra emotional baggage, says Herz. Her research\nsuggests that memories triggered by odours are more emotional than memories triggered\nby other cues. In one recent study, Herz recruited five volunteers who had vivid memories\nassociated with a particular perfume, such as opium for Women and Juniper Breeze from\nBath and Body Works.\nShe took images of the volunteers’ brains as they sniffed that perfume and an unrelated\nperfume without knowing which was which. (They were also shown photos of each perfume\nbottle.) Smelling the specified perfume activated the volunteers brains the most, particularly\nin the amygdala, and in a region called the hippocampus which helps in memory formation.\nHerz published the work earlier this year in the journal Neuropsychologia.\nE. But she couldn’t be sure that the other senses wouldn’t also elicit a strong response. So\nin another study Herz compared smells with sounds and pictures. She had 70 people\ndescribe an emotional memory involving three items – popcorn, fresh-cut grass and a\ncampfire. Then they compared the items through sights, sounds and smells. For instance,\nthe person might see a picture of a lawnmower, then sniff the scent of grass and finally\nlisten to the lawnmower’s sound. Memories triggered by smell were more evocative than\nmemories triggered by either sights or sounds.\nF. Odour-evoked memories may be not only more emotional, but more detailed as well.\nWorking with colleague John Downes, psychologist Simon Chu of the University of\nLiverpool started researching odour and memory partly because of his grandmother’s\nstories about Chinese culture. As generations gathered to share oral histories, they would\npass a small pot of spice or incense around; later, when they wanted to remember the story\nin as much detail as possible, they would pass the same smell around again.\n \n”It’s kind of fits with a lot of anecdotal evidence on how smells can be really good reminders\nof past experiences,” Chu says. And scientific research seems to bear out the anecdotes.\nIn one experiment, Chu and Downes asked 42 volunteers to tell a life story, then tested to\nsee whether odours such as coffee and cinnamon could help them remember more detail\nin the story. They could.\nG. Despite such studies, not everyone is convinced that Proust can be scientifically\nanalysed. In the June issue of Chemical Senses, Chu and Downes exchanged critiques\nwith renowned perfumer and chemist J. Stephan Jellinek. Jellinek chided the Liverpool\nresearchers for, among other things, presenting the smells and asking the volunteers to\nthink of memories, rather than seeing what memories were spontaneously evoked by the\n \n2\n\nodours. But there’s only so much science can do to test a phenomenon that’s inherently\ndifferent for each person, Chu says.\nMeanwhile, Jellinek has also been collecting anecdotal accounts of Proustian experiences,\nhoping to find some common links between the experiences. “I think there is a case to be\nmade that surprise may be a major aspect of the Proust phenomenon,” he says. “That’s\nwhy people are so struck by these memories.” No one knows whether Proust ever\nexperienced such a transcendental moment. But his notions of memory, written as fiction\nnearly a century ago, continue to inspire scientists of today.\n \n3",
