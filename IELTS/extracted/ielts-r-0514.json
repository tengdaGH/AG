  "passage_text": "Reading Practice\n \nThe megafires of California\nDrought, housing expansion, and oversupply of tinder make for bigger, hotter fires in the\nwestern United States\nWildfires are becoming an increasing menace in the western United States, with Southern\nCalifornia being the hardest hit area. There's a reason fire squads battling more frequent\nblazes in Southern California are having such difficulty containing the flames, despite better\npreparedness than ever and decades of experience fighting fires fanned by the ‘Santa Ana\nWinds’. The wildfires themselves, experts say, are generally hotter, faster, and spread\nmore erratically than in the past.\nMegafires, also called ‘siege fires’, are the increasingly frequent blazes that burn 500,000\nacres or more - 10 times the size of the average forest fire of 20 years ago. Some recent\nwildfires are among the biggest ever in California in terms of acreage burned, according to\nstate figures and news reports.\nOne explanation for the trend to more superhot fires is that the region, which usually has\ndry summers, has had significantly below normal precipitation in many recent years.\nAnother reason, experts say, is related to the century- long policy of the US Forest Service\nto stop wildfires as quickly as possible.\nThe unintentional consequence has been to halt the natural eradication of underbrush, now\nthe primary fuel for megafires.\nThree other factors contribute to the trend, they add. First is climate change, marked by a\n1-degree Fahrenheit rise in average yearly temperature across the western states. Second\nis fire seasons that on average are 78 days longer than they were 20 years ago. Third is\nincreased construction of homes in wooded areas.\n‘We are increasingly building our homes in fire-prone ecosystems,’ says Dominik\nKulakowski, adjunct professor of biology at Clark University Graduate School of Geography\nin Worcester, Massachusetts. ‘Doing that in many of the forests of the western US is like\nbuilding homes on the side of an active volcano.'\nIn California, where population growth has averaged more than 600,000 a year for at least\na decade, more residential housing is being built. ‘What once was open space is now\nresidential homes providing fuel to make fires burn with greater intensity,’ says Terry\nMcHale of the California Department of Forestry firefighters' union. ‘With so much dryness,\nso many communities to catch fire, so many fronts to fight, it becomes an almost incredible\njob.'\nThat said, many experts give California high marks for making progress on preparedness in\nrecent years, after some of the largest fires in state history scorched thousands of acres,\nburned thousands of homes, and killed numerous people. Stung in the past by criticism of\nbungling that allowed fires to spread when they might have been contained, personnel are\nmeeting the peculiar challenges of neighborhood - and canyon- hopping fires better than\npreviously, observers say.\nState promises to provide more up-to-date engines, planes, and helicopters to fight fires\nhave been fulfilled. Firefighters’ unions that in the past complained of dilapidated\n \n1\n\nequipment, old fire engines, and insufficient blueprints for fire safety are now praising the\nstate's commitment, noting that funding for firefighting has increased, despite huge cuts in\nmany other programs. ‘We are pleased that the current state administration has been very\nproactive in its support of us, and [has] come through with budgetary support of the\ninfrastructure needs we have long sought,' says Mr. McHale of the firefighters’ union.\nBesides providing money to upgrade the fire engines that must traverse the mammoth\nstate and wind along serpentine canyon roads, the state has invested in better command-\nand-control facilities as well as in the strategies to run them. ‘In the fire sieges of earlier\nyears, we found that other jurisdictions and states were willing to offer mutual-aid help, but\nwe were not able to communicate adequately with them,’ says Kim Zagaris, chief of the\nstate's Office of Emergency Services Fire and Rescue Branch.\nAfter a commission examined and revamped communications procedures, the statewide\nresponse ‘has become far more professional and responsive,’ he says. There is a sense\namong both government officials and residents that the speed, dedication, and coordination\nof firefighters from several states and jurisdictions are resulting in greater efficiency than in\npast ‘siege fire’ situations.\nIn recent years, the Southern California region has improved building codes, evacuation\nprocedures, and procurement of new technology. ‘I am extraordinarily impressed by the\nimprovements we have witnessed,’ says Randy Jacobs, a Southern California- based\nlawyer who has had to evacuate both his home and business to escape wildfires.\n‘Notwithstanding all the damage that will continue to be caused by wildfires, we will no\nlonger suffer the loss of life endured in the past because of the fire prevention and\nfirefighting measures that have been put in place,’ he says.\n \n2",
