  "passage_text": "Reading Practice\n \nDomestic robots\nMachines that look after your home are getting cleverer, but they still need care and\nattention if they are to perform as intended.\nFloor-cleaning machines capable of responding to their environment were among the first\ncommercially available domestic products worthy of being called robots. The best known is\nthe Roomba, made by iRobot, an American company which has sold more than three\nmillion of the discshaped, frisbee-sized vacuuming robots. The latest model, the fifth\nversion of the Roomba, has more sensors and cleverer software than its predecessors.\nPress the 'Clean' button and the robot glides out of its docking station and sets off across\nthe floor.\nDomestic robots are supposed to free up time so that you can do other things, but watching\nhow the Roomba deals with obstacles is strangely compelling. It is capable of sensing its\nsurroundings, and does not simply try to adhere to a pre-planned route, so it is not upset if\nfurniture is moved, or if it is picked up and taken to clean another room. Its infra-red\nsensors enable it to slow down before reaching an obstacle - such as a dozy cat - changing\ndirection and setting off again.\nIt steadily works its way around the room, figuring out how to get out from under the\ntelevision stand or untangle itself from a stray Game Boy recharging lead. Watch it for long\nenough, and you can sometimes predict its next move. The machine has a 'dirt sensor' and\nflashes a blue light when it finds things to clean up. Only when it detects no more dirt does\nit stop going over the same area and, eventually, conclude that the whole room is clean. It\nthen trundles back to dock at its recharging station.\nSo the first observation of life with a domestic robot is that you will keep watching it before\nyou trust it completely. Perhaps that is not surprising: after all, when automatic washing\nmachines first appeared, people used to draw up a chair and sit and watch them complete\ntheir wash, rinse and spin cycles. Now they just load them, switch them on and leave them\nto it.\nThe second observation is that, despite their current level of intelligence, certain\nallowances must be made to get the best out of a domestic robot. The Roomba can be set\nup to dean at particular times, and to clean more than one room (small infra-red\n'lighthouses' can be positioned in doorways, creating an invisible barrier between one room\nand the next that is only removed when the first room has been cleaned). A 'drop-off'\nsensor underneath the robot prevents it from falling down stairs. All very clever, but what\nthe Roomba wilt not do is pick up toys, shoes and other items left lying around. Rooms\ncared for by robots must be kept tidy. To start with, children will happily put things away in\norder to watch the robot set off, but unfortunately the novelty soon wears off.\nSimilar allowances must be made for other domestic robots. Sweden's Husqvarna recently\nlaunched a new version of its Automower lawn mowing robot. Before it can be used, a wire\nmust be placed around the perimeter of the lawn to define the part to be cut. If toys and\nother obstacles are not cleared from the lawn before it starts work, the robot will steer\naround them, leaving uncut areas. However, the latest version can top up its batteries with\n \n1\n\nsolar power, or send its owner a text message if it gets into trouble trying to climb a mole-\nhill.\nBut there is still only a limited range of domestic robots. Machines that mop the floor, clean\na swimming pool and clear muck from guttering are made by iRobot Several surveillance\nrobots are also on offer. The Rovio, made by WowWee of Hong Kong, is a wi-fi-enabled\nwebcam, mounted on an extending arm, which rides along smoothly on a nimble set of\nthree wheels. Its movement can be remotely operated over the Internet via a laptop or\nmobile phone. The idea is that Rovio can patrol the home when its owner is away, either\nautomatically or under manual control: in the latter case, two-way communication allows\nthe operator to see and talk via the machine. So you could, for instance, shout at the cat if\nit is sleeping on your best sofa.\nSome machines are called robots even though they cannot move around. There is an\nironing robot, for instance, that resembles an inflatable dummy: put a damp shirt on it, and\nit puffs up to remove the creases. Similarly, there are elaborate trouser presses that aspire\nto be robots. But do these devices really count as robots'1 If so, then surely dishwashers\nand washing machines do, too.\nYet whatever shape or size robots come in, many will be adored. Another important\nobservation from living with a robot is that it tends to become part of the family. 'People\ngive them names, and if they have to be sent back for repair, they carefully add a mark to\nthem to ensure they get the same machine back,' says Nancy Dussault Smith of iRobot.\n \n2",
