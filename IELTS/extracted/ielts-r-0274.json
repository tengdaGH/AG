  "passage_text": "Reading Practice\n \nMammoth kill\n \nA mammoth is any species of the extinct genus Mammuthus, proboscideans commonly\nequipped with long, curved tusks and, in northern species, a covering of long hair. They\nlived from the Pliocene epoch (from around 5 million years ago) into the Holocene at about\n4,500 years ago, and were members of the family Elephantidae, which contains, along with\nmammoths, the two genera of modern elephants and their ancestors.\n \nA   Like their modern relatives, mammoths were quite large. The largest known species\nreached heights in the region of 4 m at the shoulder and weights of up to 8 tonnes, while\nexceptionally large males may have exceeded 12 tonnes. However, most species of\nmammoth were only about as large as a modern Asian elephant. Both sexes bore tusks. A\nfirst, small set appeared at about the age of six months, and these were replaced at about\n18 months by the permanent set. Growth of the permanent set was at a rate of about 2.5 to\n15.2 cm per year. Based on studies of their close relatives, the modern elephants,\nmammoths probably had a gestation period of 22 months, resulting in a single calf being\nborn. Their social structure was probably the same as that of African and Asian elephants,\nwith females living in herds headed by a matriarch, whilst bulls lived solitary lives or formed\nloose groups after sexual maturity.\n \nB   MEXICO CITY – Although it’s hard to imagine in this age of urban sprawl and\nautomobiles, North America once belonged to mammoths, camels, ground sloths as large\nas cows, bear-size beavers and other formidable beasts. Some 11,000 years ago,\nhowever, these large-bodied mammals and others – about 70 species in all – disappeared.\nTheir demise coincided roughly with the arrival of humans in the New World and dramatic\nclimatic change – factors that have inspired several theories about the die-off. Yet despite\ndecades of scientific investigation, the exact cause remains a mystery. Now new findings\noffer support to one of these controversial hypotheses: that human hunting drove this\nmegafaunal menagerie to extinction. The overkill model emerged in the 1960s, when it was\nput forth by Paul S. Martin of the University of Arizona. Since then, critics have charged\nthat no evidence exists to support the idea that the first Americans hunted to the extent\nnecessary to cause these extinctions. But at the annual meeting of the Society of\nVertebrate Paleontology in Mexico City last October, paleoecologist John Alroy of the\nUniversity of California at Santa Barbara argued that, in fact, hunting-driven extinction is\nnot only plausible, it was unavoidable. He has determined, using a computer simulation,\nthat even a very modest amount of hunting would have wiped these animals out.\n \nC   Assuming an initial human population of 100 people that grew no more than 2 percent\nannually, Alroy determined that if each band of, say, 50 people killed 15 to 20 large\nmammals a year, humans could have eliminated the animal populations within 1,000 years.\nLarge mammals in particular would have been vulnerable to the pressure because they\nhave longer gestation periods than smaller mammals and their young require extended\ncare.\nD    Not everyone agrees with Alroy’s assessment. For one, the results depend in part on\npopulation-size estimates for the extinct animals – figures that are not necessarily reliable.\nBut a more specific criticism comes from mammalogist Ross D. E. MacPhee of the\nAmerican Museum of Natural History in New York City, who points out that the relevant\narchaeological record contains barely a dozen examples of stone points embedded in\n \n1\n\n \nmammoth bones (and none, it should be noted, are known from other megafaunal remains)\n– hardly what one might expect if hunting drove these animals to extinction. Furthermore,\nsome of these species had huge ranges – the giant Jefferson’s ground sloth, for example,\nlived as far north as the Yukon and as far south as Mexico – which would have made\nslaughtering them in numbers sufficient to cause their extinction rather implausible, he\nsays.\n \nE   MacPhee agrees that humans most likely brought about these extinctions (as well as\nothers around the world that coincided with human arrival), but not directly. Rather he\nsuggests that people may have introduced hyperlethal disease, perhaps through their dogs\nor hitchhiking vermin, which then spread wildly among the immunologically naive species of\nthe New World. As in the overkill model, populations of large mammals would have a\nharder time recovering. Repeated outbreaks of a hyperdisease could thus quickly drive\nthem to the point of no return. So far MacPhee does not have empirical evidence for the\nhyperdisease hypothesis, and it won’t be easy to come by: hyperlethal disease would kill\nfar too quickly to leave its signature on the bones themselves. But he hopes that analyses\nof tissue and DNA from the last mammoths to perish will eventually reveal murderous\nmicrobes.\nF    The third explanation for what brought on this North American extinction does not\ninvolve human beings. Instead its proponents blame the loss on the weather. The\nPleistocene epoch witnessed considerable climatic instability, explains paleontologist\nRussell W. Graham of the Denver Museum of Nature and Science. As a result, certain\nhabitats disappeared, and species that had once formed communities split apart. For some\nanimals, this change brought opportunity. For much of the megafauna, however, the\nincreasingly homogeneous environment left them with shrinking geographical ranges – a\ndeath sentence for large animals, which need large ranges. Although these creatures\nmanaged to maintain viable populations through most of the Pleistocene, the final major\nfluctuation – the so-called Younger Dryas event – pushed them over the edge, Graham\nsays. For his part, Alroy is convinced that human hunters demolished the titans of the Ice\nAge. The overkill model explains everything the disease and climate scenarios explain, he\nasserts, and makes accurate predictions about which species would eventually go extinct.\n“Personally, I’m a vegetarian,” he remarks, “and I find all of this kind of gross – but\nbelievable.”\n \n2",
