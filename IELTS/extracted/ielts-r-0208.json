How much faster?\n— Limits to human sporting performance are not yet in sight —\nSince the early years of the twentieth century, when the International Athletic Federation\nbegan keeping records, there has been a steady improvement in how fast athletes run,\nhow high they jump and how far they are bale to hurl massive objects, themselves\nincluded, through space. For the so-called power events –that require a relatively brief,\nexplosive release of energy, like the 100-metre sprint and the long jump-times and\ndistances have improved ten to twenty percent. In the endurance events the results have\nbeen more dramatic. At the 1908 Olympics, John Hayes of the U.S. team ran to marathon\nin a time of 2:55:18. In 1999, Morocco’s Khalid Khannouchi set a new world record of\n2:05:42, almost thirty percent faster.\nNo one theory can explain improvements in performance, but the most important factor has\nbeen genetics. ‘The athlete must choose his parents carefully,’ says Jesus Dapena, a\nsports scientist at Indiana University, invoking an oftcited adage. Over the past century, the\ncomposition of the human gene pool has not changed appreciably, but with increasing\nglobal participation in athletics-and greater rewards to tempt athletes-it is more likely that\nindividuals possessing the unique complement of genes for athletic performance can be\nidentified early. ‘Was there someone like [sprinter] Michael Johnson in the 1920s?’ Dapena\nasks. ‘I’m sure there was, but his talent was probably never realized.’\nIdentifying genetically talented individuals is only the first step. Michael Yessis, an emeritus\nprofessor of Sports Science at California State University at Fullerton, maintains that\n‘genetics only determines about one third of what an athlete can do. But with the right\ntraining we can go much further with that one third than we’ve been going.’ Yesis believes\nthat U.S. runners, despite their impressive achievements, are ‘running on their genetics’.\nBy applying more scientific methods, ‘they’re going to go much faster’. These methods\ninclude strength training that duplicates what they are doing in their running events as well\nas plyometrics, a technique pioneered in the former Soviet Union.\nWhereas most exercises are designed to build up strength or endurance, plyometrics\nfocuses on increasing power-the rate at which an athlete can expend energy. When a\nsprinter runs, Yesis explains, her foot stays in contact with the ground for just under a tenth\nof a second, half of which is devoted to landing and the other half to pushing off. Plyometric\nexercises help athletes make the best use of this brief interval.\nNutrition is another area that sports trainers have failed to address adequately. ‘Many\nathletes are not getting the best nutrition, even through supplements,’ Yessis insists. Each\nactivity has its own nutritional needs. Few coaches, for instance, understand how\ndeficiencies in trace minerals can lead to injuries.\nFocused training will also play a role in enabling records to be broken. ‘If we applied the\nRussian training model to some of the outstanding runners we have in this country,’ Yessis\nasserts, ‘they would be breaking records left and right.’ He will not predict by how much,\nhowever: ‘Exactly what the limits are it’s hard to say, but there will be increases even if only\nby hundredths of a second, as long as our training continues to improve.’\nOne of the most important new methodologies is biomechanics, the study of the body in\nmotion. A biomechanic films an athlete in action and then digitizes her performance,\n \n1\n\nrecording the motion of every joint and limb in three dimensions. By applying Newton’s law\nto these motions, ‘we can say that this athlete’s run is not fast enough; that this one is not\nusing his arms strongly enough during take-off,’ says Dapena, who uses these methods to\nhelp high jumpers. To date, however, biomechanics has made only a small difference to\nathletic performance.\nRevolutionary ideas still come from the athletes themselves. For example, during the 1968\nOlympics in Mexico City, a relatively unknown high jumper named Dick Fosbury won the\ngold by going over the bar backwards, in complete contradiction of all the received high-\njumping wisdom, a move instantly dubbed the Fosbury flop. Fosbury himself did not know\nwhat he was doing. That understanding took the later analysis of biomechanics specialists.\nwho put their minds to comprehending something that was too complex and unorthodox\never to have been invented through their own mathematical simulations. Fosbury also\nrequired another element that lies behind many improvements in athletic performance: an\ninnovation in athletic equipment. In Fosbury’s case, it was the cushions that jumpers land\non. Traditionally, high jumpers would land in pits filled with sawdust. But by Fosbury’s time,\nsawdust pits had been replaced by soft foam cushions, ideal for flopping.\nIn the end, most people who examine human performance are humbled by the\nresourcefulness of athletes and the powers of the human body. ‘Once you study athletics,\nyou learn that it’s a vexingly complex issue,’ says John S.Raglin, a sports psychologist at\nIndiana University. ‘Core performance is not a simple or mundane thing of higher, faster,\nlonger. So many variables enter into the equation, and our understanding in many cases is\nfundamental. We’re got a long way to go.’ For the foreseeable future, records will be made\nto be broken.\n \n2",
