  "passage_text": "Reading Practice\n \nThe dark side of the technological boom\nWhat are the effects on the individual of working in modern technological workplaces?\nChanges in the way we work and how our offices are structured come at US faster and\nfaster. Waves of state-of-the-art information technology and instant telecommunications let\nus reach anyone, anywhere, and speed is the key. Most of US are too busy struggling to\nkeep pace with ongoing innovations to question the implications of our new electronic\nauthority figures. According to a number of psychologists, however, the need to stay on top\nof the information flow and the vent degree to which we remain in touch with our offices\nexact a profound toll on US as individuals.\nMass exposure to technological innovations in the workplace has come too recently for\npsychologists to reach a consensus on its societal implications. Many agree, however, that\none of the first signs of the struggle to adapt to the electronic office is often 'technostress, a\ncognitive shift that results from an over-identification with information systems. Psychologist\nCraig Brod says people become accustomed to the patterns set by electronic tools -\naccelerated time and yes/no logic - and internalize these patterns. When they leave the\noffice or go home, Brod says, they need complete isolation to recover from the effects of\nthe technology.\nBrod warns that over-reliance on electronic tools could also have serious repercussions on\nour ability to think creatively and develop new ideas. Because we don't create in a vacuum,\nhe points out, we need to avoid the temptation to replace informal gatherings for bouncing\nideas off colleagues with electronic networking. It's also more difficult to spot errors or even\nevaluate the shape of a project displayed in a flat, two-dimensional way on a screen.\nElectronically networked offices can also make it increasingly difficult to convince ourselves\nthat we're doing an adequate job and accumulating enough information to make informed\ndecisions. Philosopher Daniel Dennett points out that modern technology eliminates the\npossibility of unavoidable ignorance. As the opportunity to amass information grows larger,\nthe obligation to make accurate predictions - the right decisions - becomes more onerous.\nInstead of consoling ourselves that we're doing as good a job as we can, we are tormented\nby the knowledge that the world of information is limidess.\nFor executives near the top of the office pyramid, the benefits of the electronic revolution -\nlike telecommuting and flexible scheduling - may outweigh the disadvantages of being\ncontinuously on call. But in Workplace 2000, authors Joseph Boyett and Henry Conn\ndescribe a future in which millions of people now charged with analyzing information and\nmaking routine decisions will be replaced by less skilled workers using 'intelligent' software\nto make decisions for them. They predict that a cult of performance excellence will engulf\nmost businesses.\nThe millions of people on the bottom levels of electronic hierarchies are increasingly likely\nto spend heir days in an isolated no-man's land, subservient to intelligent information\nsystems that report their progress to unseen supervisors far away. Because computers\nmeasure quantity quality, such systems tend to reward employees who work faster more\nthan those who work better.\nService people on the telephone or at a cash register curtly terminate attempts at idle\n \n1\n\nconversation because their performance is being electronically monitored. Once judged on\ntheir ability to troubleshoot unexpected situations, they're now evaluated by the number of\ntransactions they complete in a shift or the number of keystroke required to draft a\nsweatshops', the computers are running the people, not the other way around.\n.\"I think people are going to feel an increased fragmentation of self. They won't be able to\nhold the pieces together,' human resources consultant Philip Nicholson says. \"How do you\nkeep a coherent space if you’re going in and out of spaces that don't exist?' He likens the\npsychic numbing of electronic information overload to symptoms of post- traumatic stress\nsyndrome (a mental disorder following a horrific event). In office 'wars', people become\noverwhelmed by the sheer amount of information available, internalize the diversity of the\nworld outside, and fear losing com own lives.\nIf we are to survive the challenges of information-driven, hardwired offices, says Nicholson,\nwe need to provide psychological support systems. As no one has yet measured the social\ncost of the workplace revolution, some psychologists are mobilizing efforts to pool\ninformation as it is derived. Nicholson started the Technostress International Information\nNetwork in Massachusetts to foster an exchange of data and ideas on the effects of\ncomputerization and information technology Meanwhile, Brod wants to examine the\nparallels between electronic work environments and sealed- cabin ecologies' like space\ncapsules or submarines, both totally automated artificial worlds in which people live in\nhighly confined circumstances surrounded by technology that dictates the tenor of their\ndays as well as their survival. He is petitioning other psychologists to convince the\nAmerican Psychological Association to form a specialized study group.\nIn addition, Brod suggests that we re-examine our value systems and that we make greater\nallowances for privacy in order to circumvent potential revolts against technology. We need\nto coevolve with technology,' he says. \"These are wonderful tools, but if we exploit them\nwithout imposing appropriate values on their use, they become alienating and dangerous.'\n \n2",
