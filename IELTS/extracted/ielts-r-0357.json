  "passage_text": "Reading Practice\n \nRaising the Mary Rose\nHow a sixteenth-century warship was recovered from the seabed\nOn 19 July 1545, English and French fleets were engaged in a sea battle off the coast of\nsouthern England in the area of water called the Solent, between Portsmouth and the Isle\nof Wight. Among the English vessels was a warship by the name of Mary Rose. Built in\nPortsmouth some 35 years earlier, she had had a long and successful fighting career, and\nwas a favourite of King Henry VIII. Accounts of what happened to the ship vary:\nwhile witnesses agree that she was not hit by the French, some maintain that she was\noutdated, overladen and sailing too low in the water, others that she was mishandled by\nundisciplined crew. What is undisputed, however, is that the Mary Rose sank into the\nSolent that day, taking at least 500 men with her. After the battle, attempts were made to\nrecover the ship, but these failed.\nThe Mary Rose came to rest on the seabed, lying on her starboard (right) side at an angle\nof approximately 60 degrees. The hull (the body of the ship) acted as a trap for the sand\nand mud carried by Solent currents. As a result, the starboard side filled rapidly, leaving the\nexposed port (left) side to be eroded by marine organisms and mechanical\ndegradation. Because of the way the ship sank, nearly all of the starboard half survived\nintact. During the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, the entire site became\ncovered with a layer of hard grey clay, which minimised further erosion.\nThen, on 16 June 1836, some fishermen in the Solent found that their equipment was\ncaught on an underwater obstruction, which turned out to be the Mary Rose. Diver John\nDeane happened to be exploring another sunken ship nearby, and the fishermen\napproached him, asking him to free their gear. Deane dived down, and found the\nequipment caught on a timber protruding slightly from the seabed. Exploring further, he\nuncovered several other timbers and a bronze gun. Deane continued diving on the site\nintermittently until 1840, recovering several more guns, two bows, various timbers, part of a\npump and various other small finds.\n \nThe Mary Rose then faded into obscurity for another hundred years. But in 1965, military\nhistorian and amateur diver Alexander McKee, in conjunction with the British Sub-Aqua\nClub, initiated a project called ‘Solent Ships’. While on paper this was a plan to examine a\nnumber of known wrecks in the Solent, what McKee really hoped for was to find the Mary\nRose. Ordinary search techniques proved unsatisfactory, so McKee entered\ninto collaboration with Harold E. Edgerton, professor of electrical engineering at\nthe Massachusetts Institute of Technology.\nIn 1967, Edgerton’s side-scan sonar systems revealed a large, unusually shaped object,\nwhich McKee believed was the Mary Rose.\nFurther excavations revealed stray pieces of timber and an iron gun. But the climax to the\noperation came when, on 5 May 1971, part of the ship’s frame was uncovered. McKee and\nhis team now knew for certain that they had found the wreck, but were as yet unaware that\nit also housed a treasure trove of beautifully preserved artefacts. Interest ^ in the project\ngrew, and in 1979, The Mary Rose Trust was formed, with Prince Charles as its President\n \n1\n\nand Dr Margaret Rule its Archaeological Director. The decision whether or not to salvage\nthe wreck was not an easy one, although an excavation in 1978 had shown that it might be\npossible to raise the hull. While the original aim was to raise the hull if at all feasible, the\noperation was not given the go-ahead until January 1982, when all the necessary\ninformation was available.\n \n \nAn important factor in trying to salvage the Mary Rose was that the remaining hull was an\nopen shell. This led to an important decision being taken: namely to carry out the lifting\noperation in three very distinct stages. The hull was attached to a lifting frame via a network\nof bolts and lifting wires. The problem of the hull being sucked back downwards into the\nmud was overcome by using 12 hydraulic jacks. These raised it a few centimetres over\na period of several days, as the lifting frame rose slowly up its four legs. It was only when\nthe hull was hanging freely from the lifting frame, clear of the seabed and the suction effect\nof the surrounding mud, that the salvage operation progressed to the second stage. In this\nstage, the lifting frame was fixed to a hook attached to a crane, and the hull was lifted\ncompletely clear of the seabed and transferred underwater into the lifting cradle.\nThis required precise positioning to locate the legs into the stabbing guides’ of the\nlifting cradle. The lifting cradle was designed to fit the hull jusing archaeological\nsurvey drawings, and was fitted with air bags to provide additional cushioning for the\nhull’s delicate timber framework.
