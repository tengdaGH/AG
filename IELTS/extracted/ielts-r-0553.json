  "passage_text": "Reading Practice\n \nThe secret of the Yawn\nA\nWhen a scientist began to study yawning in the 1980s, it was difficult to convince some of\nhis research students of the merits of “yawning science.” Although it may appear quirky, his\ndecision to study yawning was a logical extension to human beings of my research in\ndevelopmental neuroscience, reported in such papers as “Wing-flapping during\nDevelopment and Evolution.” As a neurobehavioral problem, there is not much difference\nbetween the wing-flapping of birds and the face – and body-flapping of human yawners.\nB\nYawning is an ancient, primitive act. Humans do it even before they are born, opening wide\nin the womb. Some snakes unhinge their jaws to do it. One species of penguins yawns as\npart of mating. Only now are researchers beginning to understand why we yawn, when we\nyawn and why we yawn back. A professor of cognitive neuroscience at Drexel University in\nPhiladelphia, Steven Platek, studies the act of contagious yawning, something done only\nby people and other primates.\nC\nIn his first experiment, he used a psychological test to rank people on their empathic\nfeelings. He found that participants who did not score high on compassion did not yawn\nback. “We literally had people saying, ‘Why am I looking at people yawning?’” Professor\nPlatek said. “It just had no effect.”\nD\nFor his second experiment, he put 10 students in a magnetic resonance imaging machine\nas they watched video tapes of people yawning. When the students watched the videos,\nthe part of the brain which reacted was the part scientists believe controls empathy – the\nposterior cingulate, in the brain’s middle rear.” I don’t know if it’s necessarily that nice\npeople yawn more, but I think it’s a good indicator of a state of mind,” said Professor\nPlatek. “It’s also a good indicator if you’re empathizing with me and paying attention.”\nE\nHis third experiment is studying yawning in those with brain disorders, such as autism and\nschizophrenia, in which victims have difficulty connecting emotionally with others. A\npsychology professor at the University of Maryland, Robert Provine, is one of the few other\nresearchers into yawning. He found the basic yawn lasts about six seconds and they come\nin bouts with an interval of about 68 seconds. Men and women yawn or half-yawn equally\noften, but men are significantly less likely to cover their mouths which may indicate\ncomplex distinction in genders.” A watched yawner never yawns,” Professor Provine said.\nHowever, the physical root of yawning remains a mystery. Some researchers say it’s\ncoordinated within the hypothalamus of the brain, the area that also controls breathing.\nF\nYawning and stretching also share properties and may be performed together as parts of a\n \n1\n\nglobal motor complex. But they do not always co-occur – people usually yawn when we\nstretch, but we don’t always stretch when we yawn, especially before bedtime. Studies by\nJ.I.P, G.H.A. Visser and H.F. Prechtl in the early 1980s, charting movement in the\ndeveloping fetus using ultrasound, observed not just yawning but a link between yawning\nand stretching as early as the end of the first prenatal trimester.\nG\nThe most extraordinary demonstration of the yawn-stretch linkage occurs in many people\nparalyzed on one side of their body because of brain damage caused by a stroke. The\nprominent British neurologist Sir Francis Walshe noted in 1923 what when these\nhemiplegics yawn, they are startled and mystified to observe that their otherwise paralyzed\narm rises and flexes automatically in what neurologists term an “associated response.”\nYawning apparently activates undamaged, unconsciously controlled connections between\nthe brain and the cord motor system innervating the paralyzed limb. It is not known whether\nthe associated response is a positive prognosis for recovery, nor whether yawning is\ntherapeutic for reinnervation or prevention of muscular atrophy.\nH\nClinical neurology offers other surprises.
