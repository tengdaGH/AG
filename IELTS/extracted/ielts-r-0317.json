  "passage_text": "Reading Practice\n \nNumeracy: can animals tell numbers? (Can animals\ncount?)\nA\nPrime among basic numerical faculties is the ability to distinguish between a larger and a\nsmaller, says psychologist Elizabeth Brannon. Humans can do this with ease – providing\nthe ratio is big enough – but do other animals share this ability? In one experiment, rhesus\nmonkeys and university students examined two sets of geometrical objects that appeared\nbriefly on a computer monitor. They had to decide which set contained more objects. Both\ngroups performed successfully but, importantly, Brannon’s team found that monkeys, like\nhumans, make more errors when two sets of objects are close in number. The students’\nperformance ends up looking just like a monkey’s. It’s practically identical, she says.\nB\nHumans and monkeys are mammals, in the animal family known as primates. These are\nnot the only animals whose numerical capacities rely on ratio, however. The same seems\nto apply to some amphibians. Psychologist Claudia Uller’s team tempted salamanders with\ntwo sets of fruit flies held in clear tubes. In a series of trials, the researchers noted which\ntube the salamanders scampered towards, reasoning that if they had a capacity to\nrecognise the number, they would head for the larger number. The salamanders\nsuccessfully discriminated between tubes containing 8 and 16 flies respectively, but not\nbetween 3 and 4, 4 and 6, or 8 and 12. So it seems that for the salamanders to\ndiscriminate between two numbers, the larger must be at least twice as big as the smaller.\nHowever, they could differentiate between 2 and 3 flies just as well as between 1 and 2\nflies, suggesting they recognise small numbers in a different way from larger numbers.\nC\nFurther support for this theory comes from studies of mosquitofish, which instinctively join\nthe biggest shoal they can. A team at the University of Padova found that while\nmosquitofish can tell the difference between a group containing 3 shoal-mates and a group\ncontaining 4, they did not show a preference between groups of 4 and 5. The team also\nfound that mosquitofish can discriminate between numbers up to 16, but only if the ratio\nbetween the fish in each shoal was greater than 2:1. This indicates that the fish, like\nsalamanders, possess both the approximate and precise number systems found in more\nintelligent animals such as infant humans and other primates.\nD\nWhile these findings are highly suggestive, some critics argue that the animals might be\nrelying on other factors to complete the tasks, without considering the number itself. ‘Any\nstudy that’s claiming an animal is capable of representing number should also be\ncontrolling for other factors,’ says Brannon. Experiments have confirmed that primates can\nindeed perform numerical feats without extra clues, but what about the more primitive\nanimals?\nE\n \n1\n\nTo consider this possibility, the mosquitofish tests were repeated, this time using varying\ngeometrical shapes in place of fish. The team arranged these shapes so that they had the\nsame overall surface area and luminance even though they contained a different number of\nobjects. Across hundreds of trials on 14 different fish, the team found they consistently\ndiscriminated 2 objects from 3. The team is now testing whether mosquitofish can also\ndistinguish 3 geometric objects from 4.\nF\nEven more primitive organisms may share this ability. Entomologist Jurgen Tautz sent a\ngroup of bees down a corridor, at the end of which lay two chambers – one which\ncontained sugar water, which they like, while the other was empty. To test the bees’\nnumeracy, the team marked each chamber with a different number of geometrical shapes –\nbetween 2 and 6. The bees quickly learned to match the number of shapes with the correct\nchamber. Like the salamanders and fish, there was a limit to the bees’ mathematical\nprowess – they could differentiate up to 4 shapes, but failed with 5 or 6 shapes.\nG\nThese studies still do not show whether animals learn to count through training, or whether\nthey are born with the skills already intact. If the latter is true, it would suggest there was a\nstrong evolutionary advantage to a mathematical mind. Proof that this may be the case has\nemerged from an experiment testing the mathematical ability of three – and four-day-old\nchicks. Like mosquitofish, chicks prefer to be around as many of their siblings as possible,\nso they will always head towards a larger number of their kin. If chicks spend their first few\ndays surrounded by certain objects, they become attached to these objects as if they were\nfamily. Researchers placed each chick in the middle of a platform and showed it two\ngroups of balls of paper. Next, they hid the two piles behind screens, changed the\nquantities and revealed them to the chick. This forced the chick to perform simple\ncomputations to decide which side now contained the biggest number of its “brothers”.\nWithout any prior coaching, the chicks scuttled to the larger quantity at a rate well above\nchance. They were doing some very simple arithmetic, claim the researchers.\nH\nWhy these skills evolved is not hard to imagine, since it would help almost any animal\nforage for food. Animals on the prowl for sustenance must constantly decide which tree has\nthe most fruit, or which patch of flowers will contain the most nectar. There are also other,\nless obvious, advantages of numeracy. In one compelling example, researchers in America\nfound that female coots appear to calculate how many eggs they have laid – and add any\nin the nest laid by an intruder – before making any decisions about adding to them. Exactly\nhow ancient these skills are is difficult to determine, however. Only by studying the\nnumerical abilities of more and more creatures using standardised procedures can we\nhope to understand the basic preconditions for the evolution of number.\n \n2",
