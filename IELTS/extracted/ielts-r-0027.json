  "passage_text": "Reading Practice\n \nA New Voyage Round the World\n \n \nA very old travel hook that holds an unusual place in English literature\n \n \n \n \nPart travelogue, part historical record of the Caribbean pirates, part scientific treatise, A\nNew Voyage Round the World was William Dampier’s account of his twelve-year series of\njourneys around the globe from 1679 to 1691.\nThe wealth and novelty of Dampier’s descriptions, combined with the highly counts of his\ncomrades’, escapades, proved so popular with a public hungry for tales of discovery and\nadventure that A New Voyage went into its third reprint within a year of publication. So\ngroundbreaking was Dampier’s account that the writers Swift and Defoe were inspired to\ncreate two of the most famous books in the English language, Gulliver’s Travels and\nRobinson Crusoe.\nDampier’s commentators have portrayed him as an unusual, not to say peculiar, man.\nNotwithstanding his undoubted qualities as an observer, he has been variously\ncharacterised as aloof, arrogant, hot-tempered and a weak leader of men. When he arrived\non the western coast of Australia, he promptly elected to leave and head north out of dislike\nfor the cold of more southerly latitudes. This physical sensitivity has often been seized on\nby his detractors, who point out that, as a result, Dampier missed out on becoming the\nname forever associated with the European discovery of Australia, that honour instead\ngoing to Captain James Cook some 80 years later. Yet it should be remembered that he\nwas able to endure a never-ending plague of discomforts and ailments in the tropics. And\nonce, wrecked off Ascension Island in the South Atlantic Ocean, he managed with his crew\nto survive for five weeks without help, living entirely on turtles and goats.\nWhat of his early life, then? Dampier was born in 1651 in Somerset, England, the son of a\ntenant farmer, George, and his wife Ann. His birthplace, Hymerford House, stands to this\nday. His parents died before he reached seniority and his guardians apprenticed the young\nWilliam to a ship’s captain, the boy having shown very early inclinations to see the world’.\nThere was nothing in his childhood to set Dampier apart from the numerous other young\nboys who were sent to sea at this time.\n \n \nHaving made brief passages to France and Newfoundland, he completed a more extended\nvoyage to Java, where he began to learn the art of navigation. Returning briefly to\nSomerset, a neighbour offered Dampier a position overseeing his plantation in Jamaica,\nwhich he took up for a time, but he soon returned to sea on a trading voyage among the\nCaribbean islands. From the viewpoint of posterity, the most significant aspect of this time\nwas that, as plantation manager, Dampier first started to keep a journal.\nAlthough Dampier wrote several books, A New Voyage Round the World is the most\nimportant and it is worth considering just why this text met with such success. Certainly, the\nbook would not have done so well purely on the merits of Dampier’s findings regarding\nmeteorology and natural history, even though they broke new ground at the time. What\nappealed more to book buyers of this era was his narrative of life among the pirates of the\nCaribbean islands, whom he joined for several years after leaving Jamaica. These tales of\nadventure among rogues and villains who had no regard for the law sparked widespread\n \n1\n\ninterest among his countrymen back home. More important even than this, however, it is\nthe superb nature of Dampier’s prose, and his ability to communicate so vividly that raised\nthe book above the common lot.\nDampier himself admits in the book’s preface that he received help with the writing of the\nbook, and other evidence exists to suggest that he was assisted by an unknown source.\nBut whatever outside assistance he may have had, the book still has certain problems. In\nparticular, his observations about nature are sometimes roughly dropped into the narrative\nat very odd junctures and these asides can sometimes interrupt the flow of the story\nDampier himself kept his observations about nature entirely separate from the main body of\nhis travels, and we should therefore hold James Knapton responsible, as he was in charge\nof checking and revising Dampier’s text, and his publishing company brought the finished\nbook to a wider audience.\n \n \nDampier’s life has been chronicled in full by numerous biographers, and I refer the reader\nin particular to Clennell Wilkinson’s excellent (and sadly out-of- print) 1929 biography, as\nwell as the recent portrait by Anton Gill. In short, despite wide acclaim for his writing,\nDampier was not blessed in the art of wealth accumulation Travelling with the pirates, while\nproviding subsistence and adventure, never netted him the treasure chest that a more\nastute financial operative might have acquired. He died in 1715, aged sixty-three, in\nColerman Street, London.\nWe have then a man of myriad and colourful parts, and perhaps not always the easiest of\nsailors to get along with because of his arrogance and hot temper. But to dwell on these\naspects today is to miss the point: it is A New Voyage Round the World that should provide\nthe most illuminating and entertaining of Dampier’s legacies. Above all, the text is studded\nwith some wonderfully colourful expressions, and readers will enjoy some of the finest\ndescriptions of storms in the English language, and the liberal wit throughout.\n \n2",
