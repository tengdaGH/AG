  "passage_text": "Reading Practice\n \nComputer Provides More Questions Than Answers\nA. The island of Antikythera lies 18 miles north of Crete, where the Aegean Sea meets the\nMediterranean. Currents there can make shipping treacherous and one ship bound for\nancient Rome never made it. The ship that sank there was a giant cargo vessel measuring\nnearly 500 feet long. It came to rest about 200 feet below the surface, where it stayed for\nmore than 2,000 years until divers looking for sponges discovered the wreck a little more\nthan a century ago.\nB. Inside the hull were a number of bronze and marble statues. From the look of things, the\nship seemed to be carrying luxury items, probably made in various Greek islands and\nbound for wealthy patrons in the growing Roman Empire. The statues were retrieved, along\nwith a lot of other unimportant stuff, and stored. Nine months later, an enterprising\narchaeologist cleared off a layer of organic material from one of the pieces of junk and\nfound that it looked like a gearwheel. It had inscriptions in Greek characters and seemed to\nhave something to do with astronomy.\nC. That piece of “Junk” went on to become the most celebrated find from the shipwreck; it\nis displayed at the National Archaeological Museum of Athens. Research has shown that\nthe wheel was part of a device so sophisticated that its complexity would not be matched\nfor a thousand years — it was also the world’s first known analogue computer. The device\nis so famous that an international conference organized in Athens a couple of weeks ago\nhad only one subject: the Antikythera Mechanism.\nD. Every discovery about the device has raised new questions. Who built the device, and\nfor what purpose? Why did the technology behind it disappear for the next thousand years?\nWhat does the device tell us about ancient Greek culture? And does the marvelous\nconstruction, and the precise knowledge of the movement of the sun and moon and Earth\nthat it implies, tell us how the ancients grappled with ideas about determinism and human\ndestiny?\nE. “We have gear trains from the 9th century in Baghdad used for simpler displays of the\nsolar and lunar motions relative to one another — they use eight gears,’ said Frangois\nCharette, a historian of science in Germany who wrote an editorial accompanying a new\nstudy of the mechanism two weeks ago in the journal Nature. “In this case, we have more\nthan 30 gears. To see it on a computer animation makes it mind-boggling. There is no\ndoubt it was a technological masterpiece.”\nF. The device was probably built between 100 and 140 BC, and the understanding of\nastronomy it displays seems to have been based on knowledge developed by the\nBabylonians around 300-700 BC, said Mike Edmunds, a professor of astrophysics at\nCardiff University in Britain. He led a research team that reconstructed what the gear\nmechanism would have looked like by using advanced three- dimensional-imaging\ntechnology. The group also decoded a number of the inscriptions. The mechanism\nexplores the relationship between lunar months __ the time it takes for the moon to cycle\nthrough its phases, say, full moon to the full moon -and calendar years. The gears had to\nbe cut precisely to reflect this complex relationship; 19 calendar years equal 235 lunar\nmonths.\nG. By turning the gear mechanism, which included what Edmunds called a beautiful system\n \n1\n\nof epicyclic gears that factored in the elliptical orbit of the moon, a person could check what\nthe sky would have looked like on a date in the past, or how it would appear in the future.\nThe mechanism was encased in a box with doors in front and back covered with\ninscriptions — a sort of instruction manual. Inside the front door were pointers indicating\nthe date and the position of the sun, moon, and zodiac, while opening the back door\nrevealed the relationship between calendar years and lunar months, and a mechanism to\npredict eclipses.\nH. “If they needed to know when eclipses would occur, and this related to the rising and\nsetting of stars and related them to dates and religious experiences, the mechanism would\ndirectly help,” said Yanis Bitsakis, a physicist at the University of Athens who co-wrote the\nNature paper. “It is a mechanical computer. You turn the handle and you have a date on\nthe front.” Building it would have been expensive and required the interaction of\nastronomer, engineers, intellectuals, and craftspeople. Charette said the device overturned\nconventional ideas that the ancient Greeks were primarily ivory tower thinkers who did not\ndeign to muddy their hands with technical stuff. It is a reminder, he said, that while the\nstudy of history often focuses on written texts, they can tell us only a fraction of what went\non at a particular time.\nI. Imagine a future historian encountering philosophy texts written in our time ~ and an\naircraft engine. The books would tell that researcher what a few scholars were thinking\ntoday, but the engine would give them a far better window into how technology influenced\nour everyday lives. Charette said it was unlikely that the device was used by practitioners\nof astrology, then still in its infancy. More likely, he said, it was bound for a mantelpiece in\nsome rich Roman’s home. Given that astronomers of the time already knew how to\ncalculate the positions of the sun and the moon and to predict eclipses without the device,\nit would have been the equivalent of a device built for a planetarium today __ something to\nspur popular interest or at least claim bragging rights.\nJ. Why was the technology that went into the device lost? “The time this was built, the\njackboot of Rome was coming through,” Edmunds said. “The Romans were good at town\nplanning and sanitation but were not known for their interest in science.” The fact that the\ndevice was so complex, and that it was being shipped with a number of other luxury items,\ntells Edmunds that it is very unlikely to have been the one ever made. “Its sophistication is\nsuch that it can’t have been the only one,” Edmunds said. “There must have been a\ntradition of making them. We’re always hopeful a better one will surface.” Indeed, he said,\nhe hopes that his study and the renewed interest in the Antikythera Mechanism will prompt\nsecond looks by both amateurs and professionals around the world. “The archaeological\nworld may look in their cupboards and maybe say, That isn’t a bit of rusty old metal in the\ncupboard.”\n \n2",
