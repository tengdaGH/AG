  "passage_text": "Reading Practice\n \nStepwells\n \nA millennium ago, stepwells were fundamental to life in the driest parts of India. Although\nmany have been neglected, recent restoration has returned them to their former glory.\nRichard Cox travelled to  north-western India to document these spectacular monuments\nfrom a bygone era.\nDuring the sixth and seventh centuries, the inhabitants of the modern-day states of Gujarat\nand Rajasthan in North-western India developed a method of gaining access to clean, fresh\ngroundwater during the dry season for drinking, bathing, watering animals and irrigation.\nHowever, the significance of this invention – the stepwell – goes beyond its utilitarian\napplication.\n \nUnique to the region, stepwells are often architecturally complex and vary widely in size\nand shape. During their heyday, they were places of gathering, of leisure, of relaxation and\nof worship for villagers of all but the lowest castes.Most stepwells are found dotted around\nthe desert areas of Gujarat (where they are called vav) and Rajasthan (where they are\nknown as baori), while a few also survive in Delhi. Some were located in or near villages as\npublic spaces for the community; others were positioned beside roads as resting places for\ntravellers.\n \nAs their name suggests, stepwells comprise a series of stone steps descending from\nground level to the water source (normally an underground aquifer) as it recedes following\nthe rains. When the water level was high, the user needed only to descend a few steps to\nreach it; when it was low, several levels would have to be negotiated.\n \nSome wells are vast, open craters with hundreds of steps paving each sloping side, often in\ntiers. Others are more elaborate, with long stepped passages leading to the water via\nseveral storeys built from stone and supported by pillars, they also included pavilions that\nsheltered visitors from the relentless heat. But perhaps the most impressive features are\nthe intricate decorative sculptures that embellish many stepwells, showing activities from\nfighting and dancing to everyday acts such as women combing their hair and churning\nbutter.\n \nDown the centuries, thousands of wells were constructed throughout northwestern India,\nbut the majority have now fallen into disuse; many are derelict and dry, as groundwater has\nbeen diverted for industrial use and the wells no longer reach the water table. Their\ncondition hasn’t been helped by recent dry spells: southern Rajasthan suffered an eight-\nyear drought between 1996 and 2004.\n \nHowever, some important sites in Gujarat have recently undergone major restoration, and\nthe state government announced in June last year that it plans to restore the stepwells\nthroughout the state.\nIn Patan, the state’s ancient capital, the stepwell of Rani Ki Vav (Queen’s Stepwell) is\nperhaps the finest current example. It was built by Queen Udayamati during the late 11th\ncentury, but became silted up following a flood during the 13th century. But the\n \n1\n\nArchaeological Survey of India began restoring it in the 1960s, and today it’s in pristine\ncondition. At 65 metres long, 20 metres wide and 27 metres deep, Rani Ki Vav features\n500 distinct sculptures carved into niches throughout the monument, depicting gods such\nas Vishnu and Parvati in various incarnations. Incredibly, in January 2001, this ancient\nstructure survived a devastating earthquake that measured 7.6 on the Richter scale.\n \nAnother example is the Surya Kund in Modhera, northern Gujarat, next to the Sun Temple,\nbuilt by King Bhima I in 1026 to honour the sun god Surya. It’s actually a tank (kund means\nreservoir or pond) rather than a well, but displays the hallmarks of stepwell architecture,\nincluding four sides of steps that descend to the bottom in a stunning geometrical\nformation. The terraces house 108 small, intricately carved shrines between the sets of\nsteps.\n \nRajasthan also has a wealth of wells. The ancient city of Bundi, 200 kilometres south of\nJaipur, is reknowned for its architecture, including its stepwells. One of the larger examples\nis Raniji Ki Baori, which was built by the queen of the region, Nathavatji, in 1699. At 46\nmetres deep, 20 metres wide and 40 metres long, the intricately carved monument is one\nof 21 baoris commissioned in the Bundi area by Nathavatji.\n \nIn the old ruined town of Abhaneri, about 95 kilometres east of Jaipur, is Chand Baori, one\nof India’s oldest and deepest wells; aesthetically, it’s perhaps one of the most dramatic.\nBuilt in around 850 AD next to the temple of Harshat Mata, the baori comprises hundreds\nof zigzagging steps that run along three of its sides, steeply descending 11 storeys,\nresulting in a striking geometric pattern when seen from afar. On the fourth side, covered\nverandas supported by ornate pillars overlook the steps.\n \nStill in public use is Neemrana Ki Baori, located just off the Jaipur–Dehli highway.\nConstructed in around 1700, it’s nine storeys deep, with the last two levels underwater. At\nground level, there are 86 colonnaded openings from where the visitor descends 170 steps\nto the deepest water source.\nToday, following years of neglect, many of these monuments to medieval engineering have\nbeen saved by the Archaeological Survey of India, which has recognised the importance of\npreserving them as part of the country’s rich history. Tourists flock to wells in far-flung\ncorners of northwestern India to gaze in wonder at these architectural marvels from 1,000\nyears ago, which serve as a reminder of both the ingenuity and artistry of ancient\ncivilisations and of the value of water to human existence.\n \n2",
