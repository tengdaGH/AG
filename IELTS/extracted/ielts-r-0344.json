  "passage_text": "Reading Practice\n \nPottery production in ancient Akrotiri\n \nExcavations at the site of prehistoric Akrotiri, on the coast of the Aegean Sea, have\nrevealed much about the technical aspects of pottery manufacture, indisputably one of the\nbasic industries of this Greek city. However, considerably less is known about the socio-\neconomic context and the way production was organised.\nThe bulk of pottery found at Akrotiri is locally made, and dates from the late fifteenth\ncentury BC. It clearly fulfilled a vast range of the settlement’s requirements: more than fifty\ndifferent types of pots can be distinguished. The pottery found includes a wide variety of\nfunctional types like storage jars, smaller containers, pouring vessels, cooking pots,\ndrinking vessels and so on, which all relate to specific activities and which would have been\nmade and distributed with those activities in mind. Given the large number of shapes\nproduced and the relatively high degree of standardisation, it has generally been assumed\nthat most, if not all, of Akrotiri pottery was produced by specialised craftsmen in a\nnondomestic context. Unfortunately neither the potters’ workshops nor kilns have been\nfound within the excavated area. The reason may be that the ceramic workshops were\nlocated on the periphery of the site, which has not yet been excavated. In any event, the\nubiquity of the pottery, and the consistent repetition of the same types in different sizes,\nsuggests production on an industrial scale.\nThe Akrotirian potters seem to have responded to pressures beyond their households,\nnamely to the increasing complexity of regional distribution and exchange systems. We can\nimagine them as fulltime craftsmen working permanently in a high production-rate craft\nsuch as pottery manufacture, and supporting themselves entirely from the proceeds of their\ncraft. In view of the above, one can begin to speak in terms of mass-produced pottery and\nthe existence of organised workshops of craftsmen during the period 1550-1500 BC. Yet,\nhow pottery production was organised at Akrotiri remains an open question, as there is no\nreal documentary evidence. Our entire knowledge comes from the ceramic material itself,\nand the tentative conclusions which can be drawn from it.\nThe invention of units of quantity and of a numerical system to count them was of capital\nimportance for an exchange-geared society such as that of Akrotiri. In spite of the absence\nof any written records, the archaeological evidence reveals that concepts of\nmeasurements, both of weight and number, had been formulated. Standard measures may\nalready have been in operation, such as those evidenced by a graduated series of lead\nweights - made in disc form - found at the site. The existence of units of capacity in Late\nBronze Age times is also evidenced by the notation of units of a liquid measure for wine on\nexcavated containers.\nIt must be recognised that the function of pottery vessels plays a very important role in\ndetermining their characteristics. The intended function affects the choice of clay, the\nproduction technique, and the shape and the size of the pots. For example, large storage\njars (pithoi) would be needed to store commodities, whereas smaller containers would be\nused for transport. In fact, the length of a man’s arm limits the size of a smaller pot to a\ncapacity of about twenty litres; that is also the maximum a man can comfortably carry.\nThe various sizes of container would thus represent standard quantities of a commodity,\nwhich is a fundamental element in the function of exchange. Akrotirian merchants handling\na commodity such as wine would have been able to determine easily the amount of wine\n \n1\n\nthey were transporting from the number of containers they carried in their ships, since the\ncapacity of each container was known to be 14-18 litres. (We could draw a parallel here\nwith the current practice in Greece of selling oil in 17 kilogram tins)\nWe may therefore assume that the shape, capacity, and, sometimes decoration of vessels\nare indicative of the commodity contained by them. Since individual transactions would\nnormally involve different quantities of a given commodity, a range of ‘standardised’ types\nof vessel would be needed to meet traders’ requirements.\nIn trying to reconstruct systems of capacity by measuring the volume of excavated pottery,\na rather generous range of tolerances must be allowed. It seems possible that the potters\nof that time had specific sizes of vessel in mind, and tried to reproduce them using a\nspecific type and amount of clay. However, it would be quite difficult for them to achieve the\nexact size required every time, without any mechanical means of regulating symmetry and\nwall thickness, and some potters would be more skilled than others. In addition, variations\nin the repetition of types and size may also occur because of unforeseen circumstances\nduring the throwing process. For instance, instead of destroying the entire pot if the clay in\nthe rim contained a piece of grit, a potter might produce a smaller pot by simply cutting off\nthe rim. Even where there is no noticeable external difference between pots meant to\ncontain the same quantity of a commodity, differences in their capacity can actually reach\none or two litres. In one case the deviation from the required size appears to be as much\nas 10-20 percent.\nThe establishment of regular trade routes within the Aegean led to increased movement of\ngoods; consequently a regular exchange of local, luxury and surplus goods, including\nmetals, would have become feasible as a result of the advances in transport technology.\nThe increased demand for standardised exchanges, inextricably linked to commercial\ntransactions, might have been one of the main factors which led to the standardisation of\npottery production. Thus, the whole network of ceramic production and exchange would\nhave depended on specific regional economic conditions, and would reflect the socio-\neconomic structure of prehistoric Akrotiri. \n \n2",
