  "passage_text": "Reading Practice\n \nThe Development of Plastics\nWhen rubber was first commercially produced in Europe during the nineteenth century, it\nrapidly became a very important commodity, particularly in the fields of transportation and\nelectricity. However, during the twentieth century a number of new synthetic materials,\ncalled plastics, superseded natural rubber in all but a few applications.\n \n \n \nRubber is a polymer—a compound containing large molecules that are formed by the\nbonding of many smaller, simpler units, repeated over and over again. The same bonding\nprinciple—polymerization—underlies the creation of a huge range of plastics by the\nchemical industry.\nThe first plastic was developed as a result of a competition in the USA. In the 1860s,\n$10,000 was offered to anybody who could replace ivory—supplies of which were\ndeclining—with something equally good as a material for making billiard balls. The prize\nwas won by John Wesley Hyatt with a material called celluloid. Celluloid was made by\ndissolving cellulose, a carbohydrate derived from plants, in a solution of camphor dissolved\nin ethanol. This new material rapidly found uses in the manufacture of products such as\nknife handles, detachable collars and cuffs, spectacle frames and photographic film.\nWithout celluloid, the film industry could never have got off the ground at the end of the\n19th century.\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nCelluloid can be repeatedly softened and reshaped by heat, and is known as a\nthermoplastic. In 1907, Leo Baekeland, a Belgian chemist working in the USA, invented a\ndifferent kind of plastic, by causing phenol and formaldehyde to react together. Baekeland\ncalled the material Bakelite, and it was the first of the thermosets—plastics that can be cast\nand moulded while hot, but cannot be softened by heat and reshaped once they have set.\nBakelite was a good insulator, and was resistant to water, acids and moderate heat. With\nthese properties it was soon being used in the manufacture of switches, household items\nsuch as knife handles, and electrical components for cars.\nSoon chemists began looking for other small molecules that could be strung together to\nmake polymers. In the 1930s British chemists discovered that the gas ethylene would\npolymerize under heat and pressure to form a thermoplastic they called polythene.\nPolypropylene followed in the 1950s. Both were used to make bottles, pipes and plastic\nbags. A small change in the starting material—replacing a hydrogen atom in ethylene with\na chlorine atom—produced PVC (polyvinyl chloride), a hard, fireproof plastic suitable for\ndrains and gutters. And by adding certain chemicals, a soft form of PVC could be\nproduced, suitable as a substitute for rubber in items such as waterproof clothing. A closely\nrelated plastic was Teflon, or PTFE (polytetrafluoroethylene). This had a very low\ncoefficient of friction, making it ideal for bearings, rollers, and non-stick frying pans.\nPolystyrene, developed during the 1930s in Germany, was a clear, glass-like material,\nused in food containers, domestic appliances and toys. Expanded polystyrene—a white,\nrigid foam—was widely used in packaging and insulation. Polyurethanes, also developed in\nGermany, found uses as adhesives, coatings, and—in the form of rigid foams—as\ninsulation materials. They are all produced from chemicals derived from crude oil, which\ncontains exactly the same elements—carbon and hydrogen—as many plastics.\nThe first of the man-made fibres, nylon, was also created in the 1930s. Its inventor was a\nchemist called Wallace Carothers, who worked for the Du Pont company in the USA. He\n \n1\n\nfound that under the right conditions, two chemicals— hexamethylenediamine and adipic\nacid—would form a polymer that could be pumped out through holes and then stretched to\nform long glossy threads that could be woven like silk. Its first use was to make parachutes\nfor the US armed forces in World War H. In the post-war years nylon completely replaced\nsilk in the manufacture of stockings. Subsequently many other synthetic fibres joined nylon,\nincluding Orion, Acrilan and Terylene. Today most garments are made of a blend of natural\nfibres, such as cotton and wool, and man-made fibres that make fabrics easier to look after.\nThe great strength of plastic is its indestructibility. However, this quality is also something of\na drawback: beaches all over the world, even on the remotest islands, are littered with\nplastic bottles that nothing can destroy. Nor is it very easy to recycle plastics, as different\ntypes of plastic are often used in the same items and call for different treatments. Plastics\ncan be made biodegradable by incorporating into their structure a material such as starch,\nwhich is attacked by bacteria and causes the plastic to fall apart. Other materials can be\nincorporated that gradually decay in sunlight—although bottles made of such materials\nhave to be stored in the dark, to ensure that they do not disintegrate before they have been\nused.\n \n2",
