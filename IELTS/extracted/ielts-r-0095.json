  "passage_text": "Reading Practice\n \nChildren’s literature studies today\n \nWho studies children’s literature and what is it that they study? The answers to this\nquestion are complex and messy, because of the many confounding factors which exist in\nthis field.\n \nFirstly, unlike literature for adults. Children’s literature is not generally written by its own\nreaders. Adults write for children, and thus adult perceptions of what children are and of\nwhat they could and should be become woven into the literature.\n \nFurthermore, some of those who study children’s literature (and those who write certain\nkinds of children’s books) are less interested in literary values than in the kinds of lessons it\ncan teach- either in terms of creating better children or in terms of serving a particular\ncurriculum. The issue of how a teacher can use a children’s book is often contentious, but\neven outside the classroom, much material for children is still didactic.\n \nThirdly, while almost all literature is currently promoted within a strong commercial matrix,\nchildren’s literature is often especially targeted for marketing initiatives. This fact means\nthat readers are often recruited with a message that is negligibly literary and significantly\noriented to ideas of consumption. Daniel Hade (2002) has raised useful questions about\nwhether children’s experience of reading is altered when their books are part of a larger\nmarketing framework involving the movie, the game, and the toy of a popular children’s\nbook. How children perceive and respond to their stories in this new context is an important\nquestion.\n \nIt is also important to note that texts in an ever-increasing range of new media compete\nwith print media for the attention of the child reader, and create definitional issues for\nscholars. Does the term literature’ exclusively imply a verbal text? If not, where are the\nlimits? Could a literary computer game ever be considered a work of literature? If not, what\nkind of attention should be paid to it, since children themselves undoubtedly perceive their\nprint literature as part of a broader continuum? The internet provides one forum through\nwhich children now communicate with each other. (In 2003, the internet search engine\nGoogle listed 7,920,000 sites relating to the Harry Potter novels; even allowing for\nduplication and dead ends, that is a number with revolutionary implications.)\n \nFinally, in the context of the higher education institutions where the formal study of\nchildren’s literature of often located, at least three disciplinary frameworks (English,\neducation, and librarianship) fragment the focus of scholarly study of children’s literature.\nHow is the value of the imaginative encounter with the work of literature sustained and\n \n1\n\n \nhonored among such a welter of conflicting interests? One route through this maze is to\nask the child readers for help. As David Lewis (2001) has perceptively noted, what children\nthink of reading is not usually the same as what adults think, whether teachers or parents.\nAs Lewis points out children ‘sometimes see more and they often see differently’. If those\nwho study reading can explore children’s perceptions as well as those of adults, their\nunderstanding of the nature of reading will be enhanced.\n \nLewis makes a further valid point when he adds that exploring children’s perceptions is\nusually justified for educational reasons: “It is true that a better understanding of how\nchildren read and how they learn to read, is a prerequisite to improved approaches to\nteaching. However, it can also be argued, as Lewis rightly does, that when children’s\nresponses to literature are accessed and interpreted, they frequently lead to an\nunderstanding of how picture books appeal to children.\n \nYoung people’s accounts of what and how they read also enable a more sophisticated\ndescription of many of the complex processes involved in reading. All descriptions of\nreading run the risk of solipsism: i.e. this is how I read so this is what reading is for\neveryone. Asking other readers how they read, however, reduces that risk. For example, if I\nam a strong visualizer as I read, I may consider that visualization is a key component of\nsuccessful reading and I may judge books by their capacity to evoke a vivid visual\nresponse. Other readers, however, may help me to realize that not everyone reads with\nmental pictures. Some readers respond to the patterns of the words, ‘hearing’ them\ninaudibly like a subliminal radio program. Others respond to the patterns of feelings in the\nstory, responding with an emotional connection. Talking to competent readers, of all ages,\nprovides a better understanding of reading experiences.\nChildren’s insights are even more important when it comes to understanding the\nsignificance of print literature as one aspect of literary culture. Too often adults assume that\nreading any book at all is a more worthwhile experience than playing a digital game of any\nkind. A humbler approach would include asking why the game appeals to the player. Many\nadults will probably never develop the automatic skills to precess a game as readily as they\ncan read a book. This does not indicate that a book is better, but that a particular set of\nskills is absent Non-players must acknowledge that some fictional universes are thus\nclosed to them, and a logical response would be to find someone who can guide them to\nthe pleasures and challenges of the gaming world. Games need to be judged individually\njust as books do, and any evaluative framework needs to take this into account.\n \n2\n\nQUESTIONS 1-3\nChoose the correct letter A, B, C or D.\nWrite the correct answer on boxes 27-29, on your answer sheet.\n27. Which of the following best summarises the writer’s argument in the second\nparagraph?\nA Children are portrayed as adults see them.\nB Children are unable to write their own stories.\nC Adults fail to stimulate children’s imaginations.\nD Adult literature is too difficult for children.\n28.
