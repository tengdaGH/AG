  "passage_text": "Reading Practice\n \n \n \n \nThe truth about lying\nOver the years Richard Wiseman has tried to unravel the truth about deception -\ninvestigating the signs that give away a liar.\nA\nIn the 1970s, as part of a large-scale research programme exploring the area of\nInterspecies communication, Dr Francine Patterson from Stanford University attempted to\nteach two lowland gorillas called Michael and Koko a simplified version of Sign Language.\nAccording to Patterson, the great apes were capable of holding meaningful conversations,\nand could even reflect upon profound topics, such as love and death. During the project,\ntheir trainers believe they uncovered instances where the two gorillas' linguistic skills\nseemed to provide reliable evidence of intentional deceit. In one example, Koko broke a toy\ncat, and then signed to indicate that the breakage had been caused by one of her trainers.\nIn another episode, Michael ripped a jacket belonging to a trainer and, when asked who\nwas responsible for the incident, signed ‘Koko’. When the trainer expressed some\nscepticism, Michael appeared to change his mind, and indicated that Dr Patterson was\nactually responsible, before finally confessing.\nB\nOther researchers have explored the development of deception in children. Some of the\nmost interesting experiments have involved asking youngsters not to take a peek at their\nfavourite toys. During these studies, a child is led into a laboratory and asked to face one of\nthe walls. The experimenter then explains that he is going to set up an elaborate toy a few\nfeet behind them. After setting up the toy, the experimenter says that he has to leave the\nlaboratory, and asks the child not to turn around and peek at the toy. The child is secretly\nfilmed by hidden cameras for a few minutes, and then the experimenter returns and asks\nthem whether they peeked. Almost all three-year-olds do, and then half of them lie about it\nto the experimenter. By the time the children have reached the age of five, all of them peek\nand all of them lie. The results provide compelling evidence that lying starts to emerge the\nmoment we learn to speak.\n \n \n \nC\nSo what are the tell-tale signs that give away a lie? In 1994, the psychologist Richard\nWiseman devised a large-scale experiment on a TV programme called Tomorrow's\nWorld. As part of the experiment, viewers watched two interviews in which Wiseman asked\na presenter in front of the cameras to describe his favourite film. In one interview, the\npresenter picked Some Like It Hot and he told the truth; in the other interview, he picked\nGone with the Wind and lied. The viewers were then invited to make a choice - to\ntelephone in to say which film he was lying about. More than 30,000 calls were received,\nbut viewers were unable to tell the difference and the vote was a 50/50 split. In similar\nexperiments, the results have been remarkably consistent - when it comes to lie detection,\npeople might as well simply toss a coin. It doesn’t matter if you are male or female, young\nor old; very few people are able to detect deception.\nD\n \n1\n\nWhy is this? Professor Charles Bond from the Texas Christian University has conducted\nsurveys into the sorts of behaviour people associate with lying. He has interviewed\nthousands of people from more than 60 countries, asking them to describe how they set\nabout telling whether someone is lying. People’s answers are remarkably consistent.\nAlmost everyone thinks liars tend to avert their gaze, nervously wave their hands around\nand shift about in their seats. There is, however, one small problem. Researchers have\nspent hour upon hour carefully comparing films of liars and truth-tellers. The results are\nclear. Liars do not necessarily look away from you; they do not appear nervous and move\ntheir hands around or shift about in their seats. People fail to detect lies because they are\nbasing their opinions on behaviours that are not actually associated with deception.\n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \nE\nSo what are we missing? It is obvious that the more information you give away, the greater\nthe chances of some of it coming back to haunt you. As a result, liars tend to say less and\nprovide fewer details than truth-tellers. Looking back at the transcripts of the interviews with\nthe presenter, his lie about Gone with the Wind contained about 40 words, whereas the\ntruth about Some Like It Hot was nearly twice as long. People who lie also try\npsychologically to keep a distance from their falsehoods, and so tend to include fewer\nreferences to themselves in their stories. In his entire interview about Gone with the Wind,\nthe presenter only once mentioned how the film made him feel, compared with the several\nreferences to his feelings when he talked about Some Like It Hot.\nF\n \nThe simple fact is that the real clues to deceit are in the words that people use, not the\nbody language. So do people become better lie detectors when they listen to a liar, or even\njust read a transcript of their comments? The interviews with the presenter were also\nbroadcast on radio and published in a newspaper, and although the lie-detecting abilities of\nthe television viewers were no better than chance, the newspaper readers were correct\n64% of the time, and the radio listeners scored an impressive 73% accuracy rate.\n \n \n \nadapted from The National Newspaper\n \n2",
