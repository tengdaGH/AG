In Mexico, the Medicine Direction and .Applied Sciences of the National Commission of\nDeporte analyses all aspects of sports science from the role of the auditory system in\nsporting achievement to die power of the mind and its role in the ability to win. Everything, it\nseems, is open to scrutiny. Recently, the focus has been evaluating the visual acuity of\ncyclists and long distance runners but they also focus on the more traditional areas of\nsports research, among them psychology, nutrition, anthropology, biochemistry and\nodontology1. From budding child athletes as young as 9 to the more mature-aged\nsportsperson, the facility at Deporte has attracted some of Mexico’s most famous sporting\nand Olympic hopefuls.\nB. “The study of elite athletes is now more scientific than ever” says doctor Francisco\nJavier Squares, “after each competition, athletes are exposed to vigorous medical\nexaminations and follow-up training in order to help US arrive at a program that is tailor-\nmade. “The modern athlete has become big business, no longer is there a one-size-fits-all\napproach. For example, in the past two people both 1.70 meters tall and weighing 70\nkilograms would have been given the same program of athletic conditioning – now this idea\nis obsolete. It may be that the first individual has 35 kgs of muscle and 15 kgs of fat and the\nother person, although the same height and weight may have 30 kgs of muscle and 20 kgs\nof fat. Through detailed scientific evaluation here at our facility in Deporte,” says Squares,\n“… we are able to construct a very specific training programme for each individual.”\nC. Whereas many countries in die world focus on the elevation of the glorious champion,\nthe Mexican Olympic team takes a slightly different approach. Psychologically speaking an\nathlete must bring to his endeavour a healthy dose of humility. As Squares said, “When an\nathlete wins for Mexico, it is always as a result of a combined team effort with many people\noperating behind the scenes to realise the sporting achievement. When an athlete stands\non the dais, it is because of great effort on the part of many.”\nD. As is often the case in some poorer countries, sportsmen and women are stifled in their\ndevelopment due to budgetary constraints. However this has not been a factor for\nconsideration with the team in Mexico. The Mexican government has allocated a\nsubstantial sum of money for the provision of the latest equipment and laboratories for\nsports research. In fact, the quality of Mexico’s facilities puts them on a par with countries\nlike Italy and Germany in terms of access to resources. One example of sophisticated\nequipment used at the Mexican facility is the hyperbaric chamber. This apparatus is used\nto enhance oxygen recovery after a vigorous physical workout. Says Squares, “When you\nbreathe the air while inside a hyperbaric chamber the natural state of the oxygen does not\nchange. Green plants produced the oxygen; modern technology just increases the air\npressure. This does not change the molecular composition of oxygen. Increased pressure\njust allows oxygen to get into tissues better. Due to our purchase of the hyperbaric\nchamber, athletes are able to recover from an intense workout in a much shorter space of\ntime. We typically use the chamber for sessions of 45 to 60 minutes daffy or three times\nper week.”\n \n1\n\nE. When pushed to the limit, the true indicator of fitness is not how hard the heart operates,\nbut how quickly it can recover after an extreme workout. Therefore, another focus area of\nstudy for the team in Mexico has been the endurance of the heart. To measure this\nrecovery rate, an electroencephalograph (EEG) is used. The EEG enables doctors to\nmonitor the brainwave activity from sensors placed on the scalp. Athletes exert intense\neffort for a sustained period after which they are given time to rest and recover. During\nthese periods between intense physical exertion and recovery, doctors are able to monitor\nany weaknesses in the way the heart responds. The CCG has had a big impact upon our\nability to measure the muscular endurance of the heart.\n  \n \nF. In 1796, the life expectancy of a human being was between 25 and 36 years, in 1886\nthat number basically doubled to between 45 and 50. In 1996, the life expectancy of an\naverage Mexican stood at around 75 years. People are living longer and this is due in large\npart to the advances of modern science. It is not all sophisticated medical equipment that is\nplaying a part; although lesser in impact, basic advances in engineering are also greatly\nassisting. Take for example, a professional tennis player. In the past, most tennis players’\nshoes were constructed with fabric and a solid rubber sole. These shoes were of poor\nconstruction and resulted in hip and foot injuries. Today the technology of shoe\nconstruction has radically changed. Now some shoes are injected with silicone and made\nof more comfortable, ergonomic1 construction. This has helped not only the elite but also\nthe recreational sportsperson and thus, helps in the preservation of the human body.\n    \n1 objects designed to be better adapted to the shape of the human body\n \n2",
