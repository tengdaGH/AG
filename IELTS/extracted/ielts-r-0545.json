  "passage_text": "Reading Practice\n \nThe Risks of Cigarette Smoke\nDiscovered in the early 1800s and named nicotianine, the oily essence now called nicotine\nis the main active ingredient of tobacco. Nicotine, however, is only a small component of\ncigarette smoke, which contains more than 4,700 chemical compounds, including 43\ncancer-causing substances. In recent times, scientific research has been providing\nevidence that years of cigarette smoking vastly increases the risk of developing fatal\nmedical conditions. \nIn addition to being responsible for more than 85 per cent of lung cancers, smoking is\nassociated with cancers of, amongst others, the mouth, stomach and kidneys, and is\nthought to cause about 14 per cent of leukemia and cervical cancers. In 1990, smoking\ncaused more than 84,000 deaths, mainly resulting from such problems as pneumonia,\nbronchitis and influenza. Smoking, it is believed, is responsible for 30 per cent of all deaths\nfrom cancer and clearly represents the most important preventable cause of cancer in\ncountries like the United States today.\nPassive smoking, the breathing in of the side-stream smoke from the burning of tobacco\nbetween puffs or of the smoke exhaled by a smoker, also causes a serious health risk. A\nreport published in 1992 by the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) emphasized\nthe health dangers, especially from side-stream smoke. This type of smoke contains more,\nsmaller particles and is therefore more likely to be deposited deep in the lungs. On the\nbasis of this report, the EPA has classified environmental tobacco smoke in the highest risk\ncategory for causing cancer.\nAs an illustration of the health risks, in the case of a married couple where one partner is a\nsmoker and one a non-smoker, the latter is believed to have a 30 per cent higher risk of\ndeath from heart disease because of passive smoking. The risk of lung cancer also\nincreases over the years of exposure and the figure jumps to 80 per cent if the spouse has\nbeen smoking four packs a day for 20 years. It has been calculated that 17 per cent of\ncases of lung cancer can be attributed to high levels of exposure to second-hand tobacco\nsmoke during childhood and adolescence. \nA more recent study by researchers at the University of California at San Francisco (UCSF)\nhas shown that second-hand cigarette smoke does more harm to non-smokers than to\nsmokers. Leaving aside the philosophical question of whether anyone should have to\nbreathe someone else's cigarette smoke, the report suggests that the smoke experienced\nby many people in their daily lives is enough to produce substantial adverse effects on a\nperson's heart and lungs.\nThe report, published in the Journal of the American Medical Association (AMA), was\nbased on the researchers' own earlier research but also includes a review of studies over\nthe past few years. The American Medical Association represents about half of all US\ndoctors and is a strong opponent of smoking. The study suggests that people who smoke\ncigarettes are continually damaging their cardiovascular system, which adapts in order to\ncompensate for the effects of smoking. It further states that people who do not smoke do\nnot have the benefit of their system adapting to the smoke inhalation. Consequently, the\neffects of passive smoking are far greater on non-smokers than on smokers.\n \n1\n\nThis report emphasizes that cancer is not caused by a single element in cigarette smoke;\nharmful effects to health are caused by many components. Carbon monoxide, for example,\ncompetes with oxygen in red blood cells and interferes with the blood's ability to deliver life\ngiving oxygen to the heart. Nicotine and other toxins in cigarette smoke activate small\nblood cells called platelets, which increases the likelihood of blood clots, thereby affecting\nblood circulation throughout the body.\nThe researchers criticize the practice of some scientific consultants who work with the\ntobacco industry for assuming that cigarette smoke has the same impact on smokers as it\ndoes on non-smokers. They argue that those scientists are underestimating the damage\ndone by passive smoking and, in support of their recent findings, cite some previous\nresearch which points to passive smoking as the cause for between 30,000 and 60,000\ndeaths from heart attacks each year in the United States. This means that passive smoking\nis the third most preventable cause of death after active smoking and alcohol-related\ndiseases.\nThe study argues that the type of action needed against passive smoking should be similar\nto that being taken against illegal drugs and AIDS (SIDA). The UCSF researchers maintain\nthat the simplest and most cost-effective action is to establish smoke-free work places,\nschools and public places.\n \n2",
