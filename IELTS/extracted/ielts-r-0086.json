  "passage_text": "Reading Practice\n \nCarbon Capture and Storage\nHigh coal dependence\nRenewable energy is much discussed, but coal still plays the greatest role in the generation\nof electricity, with recent figures from the International Energy Agency showing that China\nrelies on it for 79% of its power, Australia for 78%, and the US for 45%. Germany has less\nreliance at 41%, which is also the global average. Furthermore, many countries have large,\neasily accessible deposits of coal, and numerous highly skilled miners, chemists, and\nengineers. Meanwhile, 70% of the world’s steel production requires coal, and plastic and\nrayon are usually coal derivatives.\nCurrently, coal-fired power plants fed voracious appetites, but they produce carbon dioxide\n(CO2) in staggering amounts. Urbanites may grumble about an average monthly electricity\nbill of $113, yet they steadfastly ignore the fact that they are not billed for the 6-7 million\nmetric tons of CO2 their local plant belches out, which contribute to the 44% of global CO2\nlevels from fossil-fuel emissions. Yet, as skies fill with smog and temperatures soar, people\ncrave clean air and cheap power.\nThe Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change that advises the United Nations has\ntestified that the threshold of serious harm to the Earth’s temperature is a mere 2° Celsius\nabove current levels, so it is essential to reduce carbon emissions by 80% over the next 30\nyears, even as demand for energy will rise by 50%, and one proposal for this is the\nadoption of carbon capture and storage (CCS).\nUnderground carbon storage\nCurrently, CO2 storage, or sequestration as it is known, is practised by the oil and gas\nindustry, where CO2 is pumped into oil fields to maintain pressure and ease extraction –\none metric ton dissolves out about three barrels, or separated from natural gas and\npumped out of exhausted coal fields or other deep seams. The CO2 remains underground\nor is channelled into disused sandstone reservoirs. However, the sale of oil and natural gas\nis profitable, so the $17-per-ton sequestration cost is easily borne. There is also a plan for\nthe injection of CO2 into saline aquifers, 1,000 metres beneath the seabed, to prevent its\nrelease into the atmosphere.\nCarbon capture\nWhile CO2 storage has been accomplished, its capture from power plants remains largely\nhypothetical, although CCS plants throughout Western Europe and North America are on\nthe drawing board.\nThere are three main forms of CCS: pre-combustion, post-combustion, and oxy-firing. In a\n2012 paper from the US Congressional Budget Office (CBO), post-combustion capture was\nviewed most favourably since existing power plants can be retrofitted with it, whereas pre-\ncombustion and oxy-firing mean the construction of entirely new plants. However, pre-\ncombustion and oxy-firing remove more CO2 than post-combustion and generate more\nelectricity.\nPost-combustion capture means CO2 is separated from gas after coal is burnt but before\nelectricity is generated, while in oxy-firing, coal is combusted in pure oxygen. In pre-\n \n1\n\ncombustion, as in an Integrated Gasification Combined Cycle system (IGCC), oxygen, coal,\nand water ae burnt together to produce a synthetic gas called Syngas – mainly hydrogen –\nwhich drives two sets of turbines, firstly gas-driven ones, then, as the cooling Syngas travel\nthrough water, steam-driven ones. Emissions from this process contain around ten percent\nof the CO2 that burning coal produces.\nThe pros and cons of CCS\nSeveral countries are keen to scale up CCS as it may reduce carbon emissions quickly,\nand powerful lobby groups for CCS exist among professionals in mining and engineering.\nFoundries and refineries that produce steel and emit carbon may also benefit, and the oil\nand gas industry is interested because power-plant equipment consumes their products. In\naddition, recent clean energy acts in many countries mandate that a percentage of\nelectricity be generated by renewables or by more energy-efficient systems, like CCS.\nAs with desalination, where powerful lobbies wield influence, states sometimes find it\neasier to engage in large projects involving a few players rather than change behaviours on\na more scattered household scale. Furthermore, replacing coal with zero-emission\nphotovoltaic (PV) cells to produce solar energy would require covering an area nearly\n20,720 square kilometres, roughly twice the size of Lebanon or half of Denmark.\nStill, there are many reservations about CCS. Principally, it is enormously expensive:\nconservative estimates put the electricity it generates at more than five times the current\nretail price. As consumers are unlikely to want to bear this price hike, massive state\nsubsidies would be necessary for CCS to work.\nThe capital outlay of purchasing equipment for retrofitting existing power plants is high\nenough, but the energy needed to capture CO2 means one third more coal must be burnt,\nand building new CCS plants is at least 75% more expensive than retro-fitting.\nSome CCS technology is untried, for example, the Syngas-driven turbines in an IGCC\nsystem have not been used on an industrial scale. Post capture, CO2 must be compressed\ninto a supercritical liquid for transport and storage, which is also costly. The Qatar\nCarbonates and Carbon Storage Research Centre predicts 700 million barrels per day of\nthis liquid would be produced if CCS were adopted modestly. It is worth noting that current\noil production is around 85 million barrels per day, so CCS would produce eleven\ntimes more waste for burial than oil that was simultaneously being extracted.\nSequestration has been used successfully, but there are limited coal and oil fields where\noptimal conditions exist. In rock that is too brittle, earthquakes could release the CO2.\nMoreover, proposals to store CO2 in saline aquifers are just that – proposals: sequestration\nhas never been attempted in aquifers.\nMost problematic of all, CCS reduces carbon emissions but does not end them, rendering it\na medium-term solution.\nAlternatives\nThere are at least four reasonably-priced alternatives to CCS. Firstly, conventional\npulverised coal power plants are undergoing redesign so more electricity can be produced\nfrom less coal. Before coal is phased out – as ultimately it will have to be – these plants\ncould be more cost-eective. Secondly, hybrid plants using natural gas and coal could be\nbuilt. Thirdly, natural gas could be used on its own. Lastly, solar power is fast gaining\n \n2\n\ncredibility.\nIn all this, an agreed measure of cost for electricity generation must be used. This is called\na levelized cost of energy (LCOE) – an average cost of producing electricity over the\nlifetime of a power plant, including construction, financing, and operation, although pollution\nis not counted. In 2012, the CBO demonstrated that a new CCS plant had an LCOE of\nabout $0.09-0.15 per kilowatt-hour (kWh), but according to the US Energy Information\nAdministration, the LCOE from a conventional natural gas power plant without CCS is\n$0.0686/kWh, making it the cheapest way to produce clean energy.\nSolar power costs are falling rapidly. In 2013, the Los Angeles Department of Water and\nPower reported that energy via a purchase agreement from a large solar plant was\n$0.095/kWh, and Greentech Media, a company that reviews environmental projects, found\na 2014 New Mexico solar project that generates power for $0.0849/kWh.\nStill, while so much coal and so many coal-fired plants exist, decommissioning them all\nmay not be realistic. Whatever happens, the conundrum of cheap power and clean air may\nremain unsolved for some time.\n \n3",
