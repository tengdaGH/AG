  "passage_text": "Reading Practice\n \nA History of Fingerprinting\nA\nTo detectives, the answers lie at the end of our fingers. Fingerprinting offers an accurate\nand infallible means of personal identification. The ability to identify a person from a mere\nfingerprint is a powerful tool in the fight against crime. It is the most commonly used\nforensic evidence, often outperforming other methods of identification. These days, older\nmethods of ink fingerprinting, which could take weeks, have given way to newer, faster\ntechniques like fingerprint laser scanning, but the principles stay the same. No matter\nwhich way you collect fingerprint evidence, every single person’s print is unique. So, what\nmakes our fingerprints different from our neighbour’s?\nB\nA good place to start is to understand what fingerprints are and how they are created. A\nfingerprint is the arrangement of skin ridges and furrows on the tips of the fingers. This\nridged skin develops fully during foetal development, as the skin cells grow in the mother’s\nwomb. These ridges are arranged into patterns and remain the same throughout the\ncourse of a person’s life. Other visible human characteristics, like weight and height,\nchange over time whereas fingerprints do not. The reason why every fingerprint is unique is\nthat when a baby’s genes combine with environmental influences, such as temperature, it\naffects the way the ridges on the skin grow. It makes the ridges develop at different rates,\nbuckling and bending into patterns. As a result, no two people end up having the same\nfingerprints. Even identical twins possess dissimilar fingerprints.\nC\nIt is not easy to map the journey of how the unique quality of the fingerprint came to be\ndiscovered. The moment in history it happened is not entirely dear. However, the use of\nfingerprinting can be traced back to some ancient civilisations, such as Babylon and China,\nwhere thumbprints were pressed onto clay tablets to confirm business transactions.\nWhether people at this time actually realised the full extent of how fingerprints were\nimportant for identification purposes is another matter altogether. One cannot be sure if the\nact was seen as a means to confirm identity or a symbolic gesture to bind a contract, where\ngiving your fingerprint was like giving your word.\nD\nDespite this uncertainty, there are those who made a significant contribution towards the\nanalysis of fingerprinting. History tells us that a 14th century Persian doctor made an early\nstatement that no two fingerprints are alike. Later, in the 17th century, Italian physician\nMarcello Malpighi studied the distinguishing shapes of loops and spirals in fingerprints.\nIn his honour, the medical world later named a layer of skin after him. It was, however, an\nemployee for the East India Company, William Herschel, who came to see the true\npotential of fingerprinting. He took fingerprints from the local people as a form of signature\nfor contracts, in order to avoid fraud. His fascination with fingerprints propelled him to study\nthem for the next twenty years. He developed the theory that fingerprints were unique to an\nindividual and did not change at all over a lifetime. In 1880 Henry Faulds suggested that\nfingerprints could be used to identify convicted criminals. He wrote to Charles Darwin for\n \n1\n\nadvice, and the idea was referred on to Darwin’s cousin, Sir Francis Galton. Galton\neventually published an in-depth study of fingerprint science in 1892.\nE\nAlthough the fact that each person has a totally unique fingerprint pattern had been well\ndocumented and accepted for a long time, this knowledge was not exploited for criminal\nidentification until the early 20th century. In the past branding, tattooing and maiming had\nbeen used to mark the criminal for what he was. In some countries, thieves would have\ntheir hands cut off. France branded criminals with the fleur-de-lis symbol. The Romans\ntattooed mercenary soldiers to stop them from becoming deserters.\nF\nFor many years police agencies in the Western world were reluctant to use fingerprinting,\nmuch preferring the popular method of the time, the Bertillon System, where dimensions of\ncertain body parts were recorded to identify a criminal. The turning point was in 1903 when\na prisoner by the name of Will West was admitted into Leavenworth Federal Penitentiary.\nAmazingly, Will had almost the same Bertillon measurements as another prisoner residing\nat the very same prison, whose name happened to be William West. It was only their\nfingerprints that could tell them apart. From that point on, fingerprinting became the\nstandard for criminal identification.\nG\nFingerprinting was useful in identifying people with a history of crime and who were listed\non a database. However, in situations where the perpetrator was not on the database and\na crime had no witnesses, the system fell short. Fingerprint chemistry is a new technology\nthat can work alongside traditional fingerprinting to find more clues than ever before. From\norganic compounds left behind on a print, a scientist can tell if the person is a child, an\nadult, a mature person or a smoker, and much more. It seems, after all these years, fingers\ncontinue to point the way.\n \n2",
