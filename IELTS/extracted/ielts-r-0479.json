  "passage_text": "Reading Practice\nThe Game of Tennis\nA\n \n \nReal Tennis as it is called in Britain, Royal Tennis as it is called in Australia, Court Tennis\nas it is called in the States, Jeu de Paume as it is called in France, or Tennis as it is\nproperly known, is the oldest of all the racket games, and unlike most of the others, such as\nsquash or lawn tennis, it is a product of evolution rather than pure invention.\nB\n \n \nThe game started to form into something recognizable in the 11th century. It started as\nhand ball, played by monks around the cloisters of monasteries of Italy and France, much\nas schoolchildren do today in corners of their school playground. Gradually as monks\ntravelled to other monasteries, more enjoyable rules were adopted, the more bizarre rules\nabandoned and people started to add features to their courtyards that improved the\npastime, and demolish or modify others that detracted from it. The monks enjoyed the\ngame so much that the Pope banned the playing of it, and by the 14th century the game\nhad spread from cloister to castle and became a game of the nobility. There are other\ntheories about the origins of the game. A tennis historian, Roger Morgan, has theorized\nthat the game owes its origins to playing in medieval streets which is a nice idea but as the\nstreets were also used as sewers, it couldn’t have been much fun.\nc\nThe 16th and 17th centuries were the heyday of tennis. It was played by the nobility of\nFrance and Britain and there were reputedly 1800 courts in Paris alone at this time though\na lot of these would have been quite ramshackle structures. In Britain the game flourished\nwith royalty being famous players. King Henry VII was enthusiastic though not skilled but\nhis son Henry VIII (more famous for his wives!) was an adept. Kings Charles I and II of\nEngland were both keen players and the game actually indirectly led to the death of King\nJames I. One French king also died as the result of being hit by a tennis ball. Modern real\ntennis is virtually indistinguishable from the game played in those days.\nD\nOriginally the game was played with the bare hand, later with a glove, then someone had\nthe bright idea of attaching cord or tendons to the fingers. It was a short step from there to\nattaching these cords to a frame and adding a handle to make a racket. The ball, although\nsimilar in appearance to a lawn tennis ball is made with a core of cork, covered with cloth,\ntightly bound in string and covered in felt. The balls are all hand stitched and last about 2\nweeks. This method has been used throughout history, although other substances such as\nhair or wool were used for the centre, and the balls were a good deal lighter.\nE\nThe influence of real tennis can most clearly be seen in the Basque games known by the\ncatchall name of pelota. There are various forms of pelota with different types of court, ball\nand racket, and there are forms which still uses the hand or even a basket type racket.\nSimilarities can be seen in the court layout and rules. Probably most racket sports owe\nsomething to real tennis to some extent. Squash though derives from a game known as\n \n1\n\n \n \n \n \nrackets which was developed in the debtor prisons of 17th and 18th century Britain.\nF\nAs we have seen above, tennis of one kind or another has been played in France as far\nback as the 12th century. It was not until the late 19th century though that lawn tennis\nbecame popular. Major Walter Wingfield, in search of a more vigorous game than croquet\nfor the leisure classes, devised an activity that was a hybrid of badminton and real tennis.\nHe called it Sphairistike, Greek for ball games. In 1877 the All England Club held a\ntournament later to be known as Wimbledon. Eventually the game was modified from the\nprescriptions laid out by Major Wingfield. For instance Wingfield’s rules called for the game\nto be played on a court the shape of an hourglass. Soon it was played on a rectangular\ncourt. There have also been changes in the quality and type of clothing and equipment\nused. Early last century shorts were a radical idea. During the last few decades racket\nmaterials have radically changed with graphite and other compounds being used. Wooden\nrackets are now an anachronism, to the lament of the purists.\n \nG\nNowadays there is a real tennis circuit as there is for lawn tennis. The top professionals are\nas fit and skilled as their lawn tennis counterparts if not as famous and well paid. Every\ncourt in the world has its own professional or professionals and these players travel round\nthe world playing the top competitions as well as looking after their home courts. In fact real\ntennis is now probably played at a higher standard that at any other time in its history.\nH\nIn the mid 19th century there was a renaissance in tennis and a flurry of court construction\nand the first courts were built in the US and Australia. Unfortunately the coming of the First\nWorld War cut short tennis’ re-emergence. Over the last 25 years tennis has again begun\nto grow. The modern costs of building the courts inhibits the growth a bit but new courts\nhave been springing up in the US, France, Australia and the UK with talk of court\nconstruction going on in Holland, Russia and South Africa.
