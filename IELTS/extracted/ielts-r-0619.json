  "passage_text": "Reading Practice\n \nWhat Do Whales Feel?\nAn examination of the functioning of the senses in cetaceans, the group of mammals\ncomprising whales, dolphins and porpoises\nSome of the senses that we and other terrestrial mammals take for granted are either\nreduced or absent in cetaceans or fail to function well in water. For example, it appears\nfrom their brain structure that toothed species are unable to smell. Baleen species, on the\nother hand, appear to have some related brain structures but it is not known whether these\nare functional. It has been speculated that, as the blowholes evolved and migrated to the\ntop of the head, the neural pathways serving sense of smell may have been nearly all\nsacrificed. Similarly, although at least some cetaceans have taste buds, the nerves serving\nthese have degenerated or are rudimentary.\nThe sense of touch has sometimes been described as weak too, but this view is probably\nmistaken. Trainers of captive dolphins and small whales often remark on their animals’\nresponsiveness to being touched or rubbed, and both captive and free- ranging cetacean\nindividuals of all species (particularly adults and calves, or members of the same subgroup)\nappear to make frequent contact. This contact may help to maintain order within a group,\nand stroking or touching are part of the courtship ritual in most species. The area around\nthe blowhole is also particularly sensitive and captive animals often object strongly to being\ntouched there.\nThe sense of vision is developed to different degrees in different species. Baleen species\nstudied at close quarters underwater - specifically a grey whale calf in captivity for a year,\nand free-ranging right whales and humpback whales studied and filmed off Argentina and\nHawaii - have obviously tracked objects with vision underwater, and they can apparently\nsee moderately well both in water and in air. However, the position of the eyes so restricts\nthe field of vision in baleen whales that they probably do not have stereoscopic vision.\nOn the other hand, the position of the eyes in most dolphins and porpoises suggests that\nthey have stereoscopic vision forward and downward. Eye position in freshwater dolphins,\nwhich often swim on their side or upside down while feeding, suggests that what vision they\nhave is stereoscopic forward and upward. By comparison, the bottlenose dolphin has\nextremely keen vision in water. Judging from the way it watches and tracks airborne flying\nfish, it can apparently see fairly well through the air-water interface as well. And although\npreliminary experimental evidence suggests that their in-air vision is poor, the accuracy\nwith which dolphins leap high to take small fish out of a trainer’s hand provides anecdotal\nevidence to the contrary.\nSuch variation can no doubt be explained with reference to the habitats in which individual\nspecies have developed. For example, vision is obviously more useful to species inhabiting\nclear open waters than to those living in turbid rivers and flooded plains. The South\nAmerican boutu and Chinese beiji, for instance, appear to have very limited vision, and the\nIndian susus are blind, their eyes reduced to slits that probably allow them to sense only\nthe direction and intensity of light.\nAlthough the senses of taste and smell appear to have deteriorated, and vision in water\nappears to be uncertain, such weaknesses are more than compensated for by cetaceans’\nwell-developed acoustic sense. Most species are highly vocal, although they vary in the\n \n1\n\n \nrange of sounds they produce, and many forage for food using echolocation1. Large\nbaleen whales primarily use the lower frequencies and are often limited in their repertoire.\nNotable exceptions are the nearly song-like choruses of bowhead whales in summer and\nthe complex, haunting utterances of the humpback whales. Toothed species in general\nemploy more of the frequency spectrum, and produce a wider variety of sounds, than\nbaleen species (though the sperm whale apparently produces a monotonous series of\nhigh-energy clicks and little else). Some of the more complicated sounds are clearly\ncommunicative, although what role they may play in the social life and ‘culture’ of\ncetaceans has been more the subject of wild speculation than of solid science.\n1echolocation: the perception of objects by means of sound wave echoes.\n \n2",
