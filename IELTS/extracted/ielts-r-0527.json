  "passage_text": "Reading Practice\n \n \nThe Persuaders\n \nA\nWe have long lived in an age where powerful images, catchy soundbites and too-good-to\nmiss offers to bombard us from every quarter. All around us the persuaders are at work.\nOccasionally their methods are unsubtle –the planting kiss on a baby’s head by a wannabe\npolitical leader, or a liquidation sale in a shop that has been “closing down” for well over a\nyear, but generally the persuaders know what they are about and are highly capable. Be\nthey politicians, supermarket chains, salespeople or advertisers, they know exactly what to\ndo to sell us their images, ideas or produce. When it comes to persuasion, these giants rule\nsupreme. They employ the most skilled image-makers and use the best psychological\ntricks to guarantee that even the most cautious among us are open to manipulation.\nB\nWe spend more time in them than we mean to, we buy 75 percent of our food from them\nand end up with products that we did not realize we wanted. Right from the start,\nsupermarkets have been ahead of the game. For example, when Sainsbury introduced\nshopping baskets into its 1950s stores, it was a stroke of marketing genius. Now shoppers\ncould browse and pick up items they previously would have ignored. Soon after came\ntrolleys, and just as new roads attract more traffic, the same applied to trolley space. Pro\nMerlin Stone, IBM Professor of Relationship Marketing at Bristol Business School, says\naisles are laid out to maximize profits. Stores pander to our money-rich, time-poor lifestyle.\nLow turnover products —clothes and electrical goods—are stocked at the back while\nhigh—turnover items command position at the front.\nC\nStone believes supermarkets work hard to “stall” us because the more time we spend in\nthem, the more we buy. Thus, great efforts are made to make the environment pleasant.\nStores play music to relax us and some even pipe air from the in-store bakery around the\nshop. In the USA, fake aromas are sometimes used. The smell is both the most evocative\nand subliminal sense. In experiments, pleasant smells are effective in increasing our\nspending. A casino that fragranced only half its premise saw profit soar in the aroma—filled\nareas. The other success story from the supermarkets’ perspective is the loyalty card.\nPunters may assume that they are being rewarded for their fidelity, but all the while they\nare trading information about their shopping habits. Loyal shoppers could be paying 30%\nmore by sticking to their favourite shops for essential cosmetics.\nD\nResearch has shown that 75 percent of profit comes from just 30 percent of customers.\nUltimately, reward cards could be used to identify and better accommodate these “elite”\nshoppers. It could also be used to make adverts more relevant to individual consumers –\nrather like Spielberg’s futuristic thriller Minority Report, in which Tom Cruise’s character is\nbombarded with interactive personalized ads. If this sounds far-fetched, the data-gathering\nrevolution has already seen the introduction of radio – frequency identification – away to\nelectronically tag products to see who is buying what, FRID means they can follow the\n \n1\n\nproduct into people homes.\nE\nNo matter how savvy we think we are to their ploys, the ad industry still wins. Adverts focus\non what products do or on how they make us feel. Researcher Laurette Dube, in the\nJournal of Advertising Research, says when attitudes are base on “cognitive foundations”\n(logical reasoning), advertisers use informative appeals. This works for products with a little\nemotional draw but high functionality, such as bleach. Where attitude is based on effect\n(i.e, emotions), ad teams try to tap into our feelings. Researchers at the University of\nFlorida recently concluded that our emotional responses to adverts dominate over\n“cognition”.\nF\nAdvertisers play on our need to be safe (commercials for insurance), to belong (make a\ncustomer feel they are in the group in fashion ads) and for self – esteem (aspirational\nadverts). With time and space at a premium, celebrities are often used as a quick way of\nmeeting these needs – either because the celeb epitomizes success or because they seem\nfamiliar and so make the product seem “safe”. A survey of 4,000 campaigns found ads with\ncelebs were 10 percent more effective than without. Humor also stimulates a rapid\nemotional response. Heiman Chung, writing in the International Journal of Advertising,\nfound that funny ads were remembered for longer than straight ones. Combine humor with\nsexual imagery – as in Wonderbra’s “Hello Boys” ads—and you are on to a winner.\nG\nSlice-of-life ads are another tried and tested method—they paint a picture of life as you\nwould like it, but still, one that feels familiar. Abhilasha Mehta, in the Journal of Advertising\nResearch, noted that the more one’s self-image tallies with the brand being advertised, the\nstronger the commercial. Ad makers also use behaviorist theories, recognizing that the\nmore sensation we receive from an object, the better we know it. If an advert for a\nchocolate bar fails to cause salivation, it has probably failed. No wonder advertisements\nhave been dubbed the “nervous system of the business world”.\nH\nProbably all of us could make a sale if the product was something we truly believed in, but\nprofessional salespeople are in a different league—the best of them can always sell\ndifferent items to suitable customers in the best time. They do this by using very basic\npsychological techniques. Stripped to its simplest level, selling works by heightening the\nbuyer’s perception of how much they need a product or service. Buyers normally have\ncertain requirements by which they will judge the suitability of a product. The seller,\ntherefore, attempts to tease out what these conditions are and then explains how their\nproducts’ benefit can meet these requirements.\nI\nRichard Hession, author of Be a Great Salesperson says it is human nature to prefer to\nspeak rather listen, and good salespeople pander to this. They ask punters about their\nneeds and offer to work with them to achieve their objectives. As a result, the buyer feels\nthey are receiving a “consultation” rather than a sales pitch. All the while, the salesperson\npresents with a demeanour that takes it for granted that the sale will be made. Never will\n \n2\n\nthe words “if you buy” be used, but rather “when you buy”.\nJ\nDr Rob Yeung, a senior consultant at business psychologists Kiddy and Partner, says most\nsalespeople will build up a level of rapport by asking questions about hobbies, family and\nlifestyle. This has the double benefit of making the salesperson likeable while furnishing\nhim or her with more information about the client’s wants. Yeung says effective salespeople\ntry as far as possible to match their style of presenting themselves to how the buyer comes\nacross. If the buyer cracks jokes, the salespeople will respond in kind. If the buyer wants\ndetail, the seller provides it, if they are more interested in the feel of the product, the seller\nwill focus on this. At its most extreme, appearing empathetic can even include the\nsalesperson attempting to “mirror” the hobby language of the buyer.\nK\nWhatever the method used, all salespeople work towards one aim: “closing the deal”. In\nfact, they will be looking for “closing signals” through their dealings with potential clients.\nOnce again the process works by assuming success. The buyer is not asked “are you\ninterested?” as this can invite a negative response. Instead, the seller takes it for granted\nthat the deal is effectively done: when the salesman asks you for a convenient delivery\ndate or asks what color you want, you will probably respond accordingly. Only afterwards\nmight you wonder why you proved such a pushover.\n \n3",
