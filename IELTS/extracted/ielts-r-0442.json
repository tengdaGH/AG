  "passage_text": "Reading Practice\n \nThe burden of thirst\nMillions of women carry water long distances. If they had a tap by their door, whole\nsocieties would be transformed.\nA\nAylito Binayo’s feet know the mountain. Even at four in the morning, she can run down the\nrocks to the river by starlight alone and climb the steep mountain back up to her village with\na container of water on her back. She has made this journey three times a day since she\nwas a small child.\nSo has every other woman in her village of Foro, in the Konso district of south-western\nEthiopia in Africa. Binayo left school when she was eight years old, in part because she\nhad to help her mother fetch water from the Toiro River. The water is unsafe to drink; every\nyear that the drought continues, the river carries less water, and its flow is reduced. But it is\nthe only water Foro has ever had.\nB\nIn developed parts of the world, people turn on a tap and out pours abundant, clean water.\nYet nearly 900 million people in the world have no access to clean water. Furthermore, 2.5\nbillion people have no safe way to get rid of human waste. Polluted water and lack of\nproper hygiene cause disease and kill 3.3 million people around the world annually, most of\nthem children. In southern Ethiopia and in northern Kenya, a lack of rain over the past few\nyears has made even dirty water hard to find. But soon, for the first time, things are going\nto change.\nC\nBringing clean water close to villagers’ homes is the key to the problem. Communities\nwhere clean water becomes accessible and plentiful are transformed. All the hours\npreviously spent hauling water can be used to cultivate more crops, raise more animals or\neven start a business. Families spend less time sick or caring for family members who are\nunwell. Most important, not having to collect water means girls can go to school and get\njobs. The need to fetch water for the family, or to take care of younger siblings while their\nmother goes, usually prevents them ever having this experience.\nD\nBut the challenges of bringing water to remote villages like those in Konso are\noverwhelming. Locating water underground and then reaching it by means of deep wells\nrequires geological expertise and expensive, heavy machines. Abandoned wells and water\nprojects litter the villages of Konso. In similar villages around the developing world, the\nbiggest problem with water schemes is that about half of them break down soon after the\ngroups that built them move on. Sometimes technology is used that can’t be repaired\nlocally, or spare parts are available only in the capital.\nE\nToday, a UK-based international non-profit organisation called WaterAid is tackling the job\n \n1\n\nof bringing water to the most remote villages of Konso. Their approach combines\ntechnologies proven to last - such as building a sand dam to capture and filter rainwater\nthat would otherwise drain away. But the real innovation is that WaterAid believes\ntechnology is only part of the solution. Just as important is involving the local community in\ndesigning, building and maintaining new water projects. Before beginning any project,\nWaterAid asks the community to create a WASH (water, sanitation, hygiene) committee of\nseven people. The committee works with WaterAid to plan projects and involve the village\nin construction. Then it maintains and runs the project.\nF\nThe people of Konso, who grow their crops on terraces they have dug into the sides of\nmountains, are famous for hard work. In the village of Orbesho, residents even constructed\na road themselves so that drilling machinery could come in. Last summer, their pump,\ninstalled by the river, was being motorised to push its water to a newly built reservoir on top\nof a nearby mountain. From there, gravity will carry it down in pipes to villages on the other\nside of the mountain. Residents of those villages have each given some money to help\nfund the project. They have made concrete and collected stones for the structures. Now\nthey are digging trenches to lay pipes. If all goes well, Aylito Binayo will have a tap with\nsafe water just a three-minute walk from her front door.\nadapted from National Geographic magazine\n \n2",
