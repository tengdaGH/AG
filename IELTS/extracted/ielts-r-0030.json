That is the idea behind projects now under way to capture emissions\nfrom power plants and factories and force them underground or deep into the ocean.\nThere, proponents argue, they could be trapped for thousands of years.\nA.\n              \nThis concept, known as carbon sequestration, is already being used by oil\ncompanies to improve the efficiency of oil wells, and now engineers have begun\nexploring ways to capture carbon dioxide emissions from power plants to reduce their\nimpact on the environment. At a recent conference, delegates from fourteen\nindustrialised and developing countries agreed to engage in cooperative research into\ncapturing and storing carbon dioxide.\nB.\n                \nC.\natmosphere. Over the past century, airborne carbon dioxide concentrations have\nrisen by nearly a third, according to Scott Klara, sequestration manager at the US\nNational Energy Technology Laboratory. Unless emissions are slashed by two thirds\nworldwide, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change predicts that\nconcentrations will rise to double the levels of the early 1700s, before the Industrial\nRevolution. These increased levels of carbon-based compounds in the atmosphere\nare believed to be the cause of rising temperatures and sea levels around the world.\nIgnoring the problem is therefore not an option.\nThe goal is to stabilise emissions of greenhouse gases that trap heat in the\n                \nLimiting emissions, however, is not an easy undertaking since increased\nenergy consumption is a key to economic growth. Two thirds of the world's power-\ngenerating capacity, expected to come into use by 2030, has not been constructed\nyet, according to the International Energy Agency. The developing world will be\nparticularly important. China and India alone are expected to account for two thirds of\nthe global increase in coal usage over the next fifteen years.\nD.\nSolutions are being sought. Work is being undertaken with alternatives to\nfossil fuels such as wind and solar energy, but it will be a long time before these\nalternative sources play a major role in fulfilling the world's energy needs.\nGeophysicist Klaus Lackner points out that around 85% of the world's energy is\nderived from fossil fuels, the cheapest and most plentiful energy source available,\nand the developing world in particular is unlikely to give them up. That is why many\nscientists support sequestration\nE.\nHowever, several problems must be resolved before sequestration plays a\nkey role in a low-carbon future. One is the cost of capturing carbon dioxide. A second\nis storing the gas safely once it's been captured. Today, it costs about $US50 to\nextract and store a tonne of carbon dioxide from a power plant, which raises the cost\nof producing electricity by 30-80%. Lackner argues that it is too expensive to adapt\nexisting plants to capture carbon dioxide. Instead, he recommends that carbon-\ncapturing capacity be built into future plants. Economic incentives are needed to\nencourage companies to identify low-cost carbon-sequestration solutions.

However, there are no power plants ready for full carbon\ncapture.\nOnce the carbon has been captured it must be stored. Natural carbon sinks,\nsuch as forests and wetlands, can remove some carbon dioxide from the\natmosphere, but not nearly enough. Carbon dioxide could be pumped to the bottom\nof the ocean, where the pressure would keep it pinned to the seabed in liquid form for\ndecades, but that has serious long-term environmental risks. David Hawkins, from\nthe Natural Resources Defense Council in Washington, warns that the carbon dioxide\ncould radically alter the chemical balance in the ocean, with potentially harmful\nconsequences for marine life. Others worry that the carbon dioxide could escape\nback into the atmosphere.\nG.\n                 \nA few promising attempts at underground carbon sequestration are currently\nunder way. In western Canada, an oil company is pumping liquefied carbon dioxide\ninto oil wells to force more oil to the surface and boost recovery by 10-15%. The\ncompany gets the carbon dioxide via a pipeline from North Dakota in the US, where\nthe gas is captured from a synthetic-fuel plant. In another instance in the North Sea, a\nNorwegian energy firm is injecting carbon dioxide waste from its natural-gas\noperations into a saline aquifer 1,000 metres beneath the ocean floor.\nH.\nClearly, storing large amounts of gas underground raises environmental\nfears. Environmentalists argue that more research is needed on potential storage\nsites, such as oil and gas reservoirs and coal seams unsuitable for mining, to ensure\nthat they offer long-term solutions. The World Wide Fund for Nature Australia has\nargued that the primary risk of underground storage is that dangerously large volumes\nof carbon dioxide might escape and people become asphyxiated.\nI.\nLittle progress in slashing global greenhouse gases can be achieved\nwithout involving developing countries, but for now carbon sequestration is not their\npriority because of the increased costs this would add to energy production. Hawkins\nargues that, to encourage developing nations to use sequestration, developed nations\nwill have to provide assistance. He suggests a multilateral initiative in which\ndeveloped nations, perhaps by purchasing carbon credits from poorer countries,\nfinance the difference between the cost of a regular coal-fired power plant and one\nthat captures carbon emissions. That is, the rich - who will remain the world's biggest\npolluters for years to come - would buy the right to emit carbon from the poor, who\nwould use the proceeds to build better plants.\nJ.\n \n2",
