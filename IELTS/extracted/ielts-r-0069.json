  "passage_text": "Reading Practice\n \nBiology of Bitterness\nTo many people, grapefruit is palatable only when doused in sugar. Bitter Blockers like\nadenosine monophosphate could change that.\nA.\nThere is a reason why grapefruit juice is served in little glasses: most people don’t want to\ndrink more than a few ounces at a time.  aringin, a natural chemical compound found in\ngrapefruit, tastes bitter. Some people like that bitterness in small doses and believe it\nenhances the general flavor, but others would rather avoid it altogether. So juice packagers\noften select grapefruit with low naringin though the compound has antioxidant properties\nthat some nutritionists contend may help prevent cancer and arteriosclerosis.\nB.\nIt is possible, however, to get the goodness of grapefruit juice without the bitter taste. I\nfound that out by participating in a test conducted at the Linguagen Corporation, a\nbiotechnology company in Cranbury, New Jersey. Sets of two miniature white paper cups,\nlabeled 304and 305, were placed before five people seated around a conference table.\nEach of us drank from one cup and then the other, cleansing our palates between tastes\nwith water and a soda cracker. Even the smallest sip of 304 had grapefruit ‘s unmistakable\nbitter bite. But 305 was smoother; there was the sour taste of citrus but none of the\nbitterness of naringin. This juice had been treated with adenosine monophosphate, or\nAMP, a compound that blocks the bitterness in foods without making them less nutritious.\n \n \nC.\nTaste research is a booming business these days, with scientists delving into all five\nbasics-sweet, bitter, sour, salty, and umami, the savory taste of protein. Bitterness is of\nspecial interest to industry because of its untapped potential in food. There are thousands\nof bitter -tasting compounds in nature. They defend plants by warning animals away and\nprotect animals by letting them know when a plant may be poisonous. But the system isn’t\nfoolproof. Grapefruit and cruciferous vegetable like Brussels sprouts and kale are nutritious\ndespite-and sometimes because of-their bitter-tasting components. Over time, many\npeople have learned to love them, at least in small doses. “Humans are the only species\nthat enjoys bitter taste,” says Charles Zuker, a neuroscientist at the University of  California\nSchool of Medicine at San Diego. “Every other species is averse to bitter because it means\nbad news. But we have learned to enjoy it. We drink coffee, which is bitter, and quinine [in\ntonic water] too. We enjoy having that spice in our lives.” Because bitterness can be\npleasing in small quantities but repellent when intense, bitter blockers like AMP could make\na whole range of foods, drinks, and medicines more palatable-and therefore more\nprofitable.\nD.\nPeople have varying capacities for tasting bitterness, and the differences appear to be\ngenetic. About 75 percent of people are sensitive to the taste of the bitter compounds\nphenylthiocarbamide and 6-n-propylthiouracil. and 25 percent are insensitive. Those who\nare sensitive to phenylthiocarbamide seem to be less likely than others to eat cruciferous\n \n1\n\nvegetables, according to Stephen Wooding, a geneticist at the University of Utah. Some\npeople, known as supertasters, are especially sensitive to 6-n-propylthiouraci because they\nhave an unusually high number of taste buds. Supertasters tend to shun all kinds of bitter-\ntasting things, including vegetable, coffee, and dark chocolate. Perhaps as a result, they\ntend to be thin. They’re also less fond of alcoholic drinks, which are often slightly bitter.\nDewar’s scotch, for instance, tastes somewhat sweet to most people. ” But a supertaster\ntastes no sweetness at all, only bitterness,” says Valerie Duffy, an associate professor of\ndietetics at the University of Connecticut at Storrs.\nE.\nIn one recent study, Duffy found that supertasters consume alcoholic beverages, on\naverage, only two to three times a week, compared with five or six times for the average\nnontasters. Each taste bud, which looks like an onion, consists of 50 to 100 elongated cells\nrunning from the top of the bud to the bottom. At the top is a little clump of receptors that\ncapture the taste molecules, known as tastants, in food and drink. The receptors function\nmuch like those for sight and smell. Once a bitter signal has been received, it is relayed via\nproteins known as G proteins. The G protein involved in the perception of bitterness,\nsweetness, and umami was identified in the early 1990s by Linguagen’s founder, Robert\nMargolskee, at Mount Sinai School of Medicine in New York City. Known as gustducin, the\nprotein triggers a cascade of chemical reactions that lead to changes in ion concentrations\nwithin the cell. Ultimately, this delivers a signal to the brain that\nregisters as bitter. “The signaling system is like a bucket brigade,” Margolskee says. “It\ngoes from the G protein to other proteins.”\nF.\nIn 2000 Zuker and others found some 30 different kinds of genes that code for bitter-taste\nreceptors. “We knew the number would have to be large because there is such a large\nuniverse of bitter tastants,” Zuker says. Yet no matter which tastant enters the mouth or\nwhich receptor it attaches to, bitter always tastes the same to us. The only variation derives\nfrom its intensity and the ways in which it can be flavored by the sense of smell. “Taste\ncells are like a light switch,” Zuker says. “They are either on or off.”\n \nG.\nOnce they figured put the taste mechanism, scientists began to think of ways to interfere\nwith it. They tried AMP, an organic compound found in breast milk and other substances,\nwhich is created as cells break down food. Amp has no bitterness of its own, but when put\nit in foods, Margolskee and his colleagues discovered, it attaches to bitter-taste receptors.\nAs effective as it is, AMP may not be able to dampen every type pf bitter taste, because it\nprobably doesn’t attach to all 30 bitter-taste receptors. So Linguagen has scaled up the\nhunt for other bitter blockers with a technology called high-throughput screening.\nResearchers start by coaxing cells in culture to activate bitter-taste receptors. Then\ncandidate substances, culled from chemical compound libraries, are dropped onto the\nreceptors, and scientists look for evidence of a reaction.\nH.\nTin time, some taste researchers believe, compounds like AMP will help make processed\nfoods less unhealthy. Consider, for example, that a single cup of Campbell’s chicken\nnoodle soup contains 850 milligrams of sodium chloride, or table salt-more than a third of\nthe recommended daily allowance. The salt masks the bitterness created by the high\n \n2\n\ntemperatures used in the canning process, which cause sugars and amino acids to react.\nPart of the salt could be replaced by another salt, potassium chloride, which tends to be\nscarce in some people’s diets. Potassium chloride has a bitter aftertaste, but that could be\neliminated with a dose of AMP. Bitter blockers could also be used in place of cherry or\ngrape flavoring to take the harshness out of children’s cough syrup, and they could dampen\nthe bitterness of antihistamines, antibiotics, certain HIV drugs, and other medications.\nI.\nA number of foodmakers have already begun to experiment with AMP in their products,\nand other bitter blockers are being developed by rival firms such as Senomyx in La Jolla,\nCalifornia. In a few years, perhaps, after food companies have taken the bitterness from\ncanned soup and TV dinners, they can set their sights on something more useful: a bitter\nblocker in a bottle that any of us can sprinkle on our brussels sprouts or stir into our\ngrapefruit juice.\n \n3",
