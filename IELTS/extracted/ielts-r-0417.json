  "passage_text": "Reading Practice\n \nSunset for the Oil Business\nThe world is about to run out of oil. Or perhaps not. It depends whom you believe…\nA\nMembers of the Department Analysis Centre (ODAC) recently met in London and\npresented technical data that support their grim forecast that the world is perilously close to\nrunning out of oil. Leading lights of this moment, including the geologists Colin Campbell,\nrejected rival views presented by American geological survey and the international energy\nagency that contradicted their findings. Dr Campbell even decried the amazing display of\nignorance, denial and obfuscation by government, industry and academics on this topic.\nB\nSo is the oil really running out? The answer is easy: Yes. Nobody seriously disputes the\nnotion that oil is, for all practical purposes, a non-renewable resource that will run out\nsomeday, be that years or decades away. The harder question is determining when\nprecisely oil will begin to get scarce. And answering that question involves scaling\nHubbert’s peak.\nC\nM. King Hubbert, a Shell geologist of legendary status among depletion experts, forecast in\n1956 that oil production in the United States would peak in the early 1970s and then slowly\ndecline, in something resembling a bell-shaped curve. At the time, his forecast was\ncontroversial, and many rubbished it. After 1970, however, empirical evidence proved him\ncorrect: oil production in America did indeed peak and has been in decline ever since.\nD\nDr Hubbert’s analysis drew on the observation that oil production in a new area typically\nrises quickly at first, as the easiest and cheapest reserves are tapped. Over time,\nreservoirs age and go into decline, and so lifting oil becomes more expensive. Oil from that\narea then becomes less competitive in relation to other fuels, or to oil from other areas. As\na result, production slows down and usually tapers off and declines. That, he argued, made\nfor a bell-shaped curve.\nE\nHis successful prediction has emboldened a new generation of geologists to apply his\nmethodology on a global scale. Chief among them are the experts at ODAC, who worry\nthat the global peak in production will come in the next decade. Dr Campbell used to argue\nthat the peak should have come already; he now thinks it is just around the corner. A\nheavyweight has now joined this gloomy chorus. Kenneth Deffeyes of Princeton University\nargues in a lively new book (“The View from Hubbert’s Peak”) that global oil production\ncould peak as soon as 2004.\nF\nThat sharply contradicts mainstream thinking. America’s Geological Survey prepared an\nexhaustive study of oil depletion last year (in part to rebut Dr Campbell’s arguments) that\n \n1\n\nput the peak of production some decades off. The IEA has just weighed in with its new\n“World Energy Outlook”, which foresees enough oil to comfortably meet the demand to\n2020 from remaining reserves. René Dahan, one of ExxonMobil’s top managers, goes\nfurther: with an assurance characteristic of the world’s largest energy company, he insists\nthat the world will be awash in oil for another 70 years.\nG\nWho is right? In making sense of these wildly opposing views, it is useful to look back at\nthe pitiful history of oil forecasting. Doomsters have been predicting dry wells since the\n1970s, but so far the oil is still gushing. Nearly all the predictions for 2000 made after the\n1970s oil shocks were far too pessimistic. America’s Department of Energy thought that oil\nwould reach $150 a barrel (at 2000 prices); even Exxon predicted a price of $100.\nH\nMichael Lynch of DRI-WEFA, an economic consultancy, is one of the few oil forecasters\nwho has got things generally right. In a new paper, Dr Lynch analyses those historical\nforecasts. He finds evidence of both bias and recurring errors, which suggests that\nmethodological mistakes (rather than just poor data) were the problem. In particular, he\nfaults forecasters who used Hubbert-style analysis for relying on fixed estimates of how\nmuch “ultimately recoverable” oil there really is below ground, in the industry’s jargon: that\nfigure, he insists, is actually a dynamic one, as improvements in infrastructure, knowledge\nand technology raise the amount of oil which is recoverable.\nI\nThat points to what will probably determine whether the pessimists or the optimists are\nright: technological innovation. The first camp tends to be dismissive of claims of\nforthcoming technological revolutions in such areas as deep-water drilling and enhanced\nrecovery. Dr Deffeyes captures this end-of-technology mindset well. He argues that\nbecause the industry has already spent billions on technology development, it makes it\ndifficult to ask today for new technology, as most of the wheels have already been\ninvented.\nJ\nYet techno-optimists argue that the technological revolution in oil has only just begun.\nAverage recovery rates (how much of the known oil in a reservoir can actually be brought\nto the surface) are still only around 30-35%. Industry optimists believe that new techniques\non the drawing board today could lift that figure to 50-60% within a decade.\nK\nGiven the industry’s astonishing track record of innovation, it may be foolish to bet against\nit. That is the result of adversity: the nationalisations of the 1970s forced Big Oil to develop\nreserves in expensive, inaccessible places such as the North Sea and Alaska, undermining\nDr Hubbert’s assumption that cheap reserves are developed first. The resulting upstream\ninvestments have driven down the cost of finding and developing wells over the last two\ndecades from over $20 a barrel to around $6 a barrel. The cost of producing oil has fallen\nby half, to under $4 a barrel.\nL\n \n2\n\nSuch miracles will not come cheap, however, since much of the world’s oil is now produced\nin ageing fields that are rapidly declining. The IEA concludes that global oil production need\nnot peak in the next two decades if the necessary investments are made. So how much is\nnecessary? If oil companies are to replace the output lost at those ageing fields and meet\nthe world’s ever-rising demand for oil, the agency reckons they must invest $1 trillion in\nnon-OPEC countries over the next decade alone. That’s quite a figure.\n \n3",
