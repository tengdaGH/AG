  "passage_text": "Reading Practice\n \nThe Secrets of Persuasion\nA\nOur mother may have told you the secret to getting what you ask for was to say please.\nThe reality is rather more surprising. Adam Dudding talks to a psychologist who has made\na life’s work from the science of persuasion. Some scientists peer at things through high-\npowered microscopes. Others goad rats through mazes or mix bubbling fluids in glass\nbeakers. Robert Cialdini, for his part, does curious things with towels and believes that by\ndoing so he is discovering important insights into how society works.\nB\nCialdini’s towel experiments (more of them later), are part of his research into how we\npersuade others to say yes. He wants to know why some people have a knack for bending\nthe will of others, be it a telephone cold-caller talking to you about timeshares, or a parent\nwhose children are compliant even without threats of extreme violence. While he’s anxious\nnot to be seen as the man who’s written the bible for snake-oil salesmen, for decades the\nArizona State University social psychology professor has been creating systems for the\nprinciples and methods of persuasion and writing bestsellers about them. Some people\nseem to be born with the skills; Cialdini’s claim is that by applying a little science, even\nthose of us who aren’t should be able to get our own way more often. “All my life I’ve been\nan easy mark for the blandishment of salespeople and fundraisers and I’d always\nwondered why they could get me to buy things I didn’t want and give to causes I hadn’t\nheard of,” says Cialdini on the phone from London, where his is plugging his latest book.\nC\nHe found that laboratory experiments on the psychology of persuasion were telling only\npart of the story, so he began to research influence in the real world, enrolling in sales-\ntraining programmes: “I learnt how to sell automobiles from a lot, how to sell insurance from\nan office, how to sell encyclopedias door to door.” He concluded there were six general\n“principles of influence” and has since put them to the test under slightly more scientific\nconditions. Most recently, that has meant messing about with towels. Many hotels leave a\nlittle card in each bathroom asking guests to reuse towels and thus conserve water and\nelectricity and reduce pollution. Cialdini and his colleagues wanted to test the relative\neffectiveness of different words on those cards. Would guests be motivated to co-operate\nsimply because it would help save the planet, or were other factors more compelling? To\ntest this, the researchers changed the card’s message from an environmental one to the\nsimple (and truthful) statement that the majority of guests at the hotel had reused their\ntowel at least once. Guests given this message were 26% more likely to reuse their towels\nthan those given the old message. In Cialdini’s book “Yes! 50 Secrets from the Science\nof Persuasion”, co-written with another social scientist and a business consultant, he\nexplains that guests were responding to the persuasive force of “social proof”, the idea that\nour decisions are strongly influenced by what we believe other people like us are doing.\nD\nSo much for towels. Cialdini has also learnt a lot from confectionery. Yes! Cites the work of\nNew Jersey behavioural scientist David Strohmetz, who wanted to see how restaurant\n \n1\n\npatrons would respond to ridiculously small favour from their food server, in the form of\nafter-dinner chocolate for each diner. The secret, it seems, is in how you give the\nchocolate. When the chocolates arrived in a heap with the bill, tips went up a miserly 3%\ncompared to when no chocolate was given. But when the chocolates were dropped\nindividually in front of each diner, tips went up 14%. The scientific breakthrough, though,\ncame when the waitress gave each diner one chocolate, headed away from the table then\ndoubled back to give them one more each as if such generosity had only just occurred to\nher. Tips went up 23%. This is “reciprocity” in action: we want to return favours done to us,\noften without bothering to calculate the relative value of what is being received and given.\nE\n \n \nGeeling Ng, operations manager at Auckland’s Soul Bar, says she’s never heard of Kiwi\nwaiting staff using such a cynical trick, not least because New Zealand tipping culture is so\ndifferent from that of the US: “If you did that in New Zealand, as diners were leaving they’d\nsay ‘can we have some more?” ‘ But she certainly understands the general principle of\nreciprocity. The way to a diner’s heart is “to give them something they’re not expecting in\nthe way of service. It might be something as small as leaving a mint on their plate, or it\nmight be remembering that last time they were in they wanted their water with no ice and\nno lemon. “In America, it would translate into an instant tip. In New Zealand, it translates\ninto a huge smile and thanks to you.” And no doubt, return visits.\nTHE FIVE PRINCIPLES OF PERSUASION\nF\nReciprocity: People want to give back to those who have given to them. The trick here is\nto get in first. That’s why charities put a crummy pen inside a mailout, and why smiling\nwomen in supermarkets hand out dollops of free food. Scarcity: People want more of things\nthey can have less of. Advertisers ruthlessly exploit scarcity (“limit four per customer”, “sale\nmust end soon”), and Cialdini suggests parents do too: “Kids want things that are less\navailable, so say ‘this is an unusual opportunity; you can only have this for a certain time’.”\nG\nAuthority: We trust people who know what they’re talking about. So inform people\nhonestly of your credentials before you set out to influence them. “You’d be surprised how\nmany people fail to do that,” says Cialdini. “They feel it’s impolite to talk about their\nexpertise.” In one study, therapists whose patients wouldn’t do their exercises were\nadvised to display their qualification certificates prominently. They did and experienced an\nimmediate leap in patient compliance.\nH\nCommitment/consistency: We want to act in a way that is consistent with the\ncommitments we have already made. Exploit this to get a higher sign-up rate when\nsoliciting charitable donations. First, ask workmates if they think they will sponsor you on\nyour egg-and-spoon marathon. Later, return with the sponsorship form to those who said\nyes and remind them of their earlier commitment.\n \n2\n\nI\nLinking: We say yes more often to people we like. Obvious enough, but reasons for\n“linking” can be weird. In one study, people were sent survey forms and asked to return\nthem to a named researcher. When the researcher gave a fake name resembling that of\nthe subject (eg, Cynthia Johnson is sent a survey by “Cindy Johansen”), surveys were\ntwice as likely to be completed. We favour people who resemble us, even if the\nresemblance is as minor as the sound of their name.\nJ\nSocial proof: We decide what to do by looking around to see what others just like us are\ndoing. Useful for parents, says Cialdini. “Find groups of children who are behaving in a way\nthat you would like your child to, because the child looks to the side, rather than at you.”\nMore perniciously, social proof is the force underpinning the competitive materialism of\n“keeping up with the Joneses”\n \n3",
