  "passage_text": "Reading Practice\n \nChildren's thinking\nOne of the most eminent of psychologists, Clark Hull, claimed that the essence of\nreasoning lies in the putting together of two 'behaviour segments' in some novel way, never\nactually performed before, so as to reach a goal.\nTwo followers of Clark Hull, Howard and Tracey Kendler, devised a test for children that\nwas explicitly based on Clark Hull's principles. The children were given the task of learning\nto operate a machine so as to get a toy. In order to succeed they had to go through a two-\nstage sequence. The children were trained on each stage separately. The stages consisted\nmerely of pressing the correct one of two buttons to get a marble; and of inserting the\nmarble into a small hole to release the toy.\nThe Kendlers found that the children could learn the separate bits readily enough. Given\nthe task of getting a marble by pressing the button they could get the marble; given the task\nof getting a toy when a marble was handed to them, they could use the marble. (All they\nhad to do was put it in a hole.) But they did not for the most part 'integrate', to use the\nKendlers' terminology. They did not press the button to get the marble and then proceed\nwithout further help to use the marble to get the toy. So the Kendlers concluded that they\nwere incapable of deductive reasoning.\nThe mystery at first appears to deepen when we learn, from another psychologist, Michael\nCole, and his colleagues, that adults in an African culture apparently cannot do the\nKendlers' task either. But it lessens, on the other hand, when we learn that a task was\ndevised which was strictly analogous to the Kendlers' one but much easier for the African\nmales to handle.\nInstead of the button-pressing machine, Cole used a locked box and two differently\ncoloured match-boxes, one of which contained a key that would open the box. Notice that\nthere are still two behaviour segments — 'open the right match-box to get the key' and 'use\nthe key to open the box' - so the task seems formally to be the same. But psychologically it\nis quite different. Now the subject is dealing not with a strange machine but with familiar\nmeaningful objects; and it is clear to him what he is meant to do. It then turns out that the\ndifficulty of 'integration' is greatly reduced.\nRecent work by Simon Hewson is of great interest here for it shows that, for young\nchildren, too, the difficulty lies not in the inferential processes which the task demands, but\nin certain perplexing features of the apparatus and the procedure. When these are\nchanged in ways which do not at all affect the inferential nature of the problem, then five-\nyear-old children solve the problem as well as college students did in the Kendlers' own\nexperiments.\nHewson made two crucial changes. First, he replaced the button-pressing mechanism in\nthe side panels by drawers in these panels which the child could open and shut. This took\naway the mystery from the first stage of training. Then he helped the child to understand\nthat there was no 'magic' about the specific marble which, during the second stage of\ntraining, the experimenter handed to him so that he could pop it in the hole and get the\nreward.\nA child understands nothing, after all, about how a marble put into a hole can open a little\n \n1\n\ndoor. How is he to know that any other marble of similar size will do just as well? Yet he\nmust assume that if he is to solve the problem. Hewson made the functional equivalence of\ndifferent marbles clear by playing a 'swapping game' with the children. The two\nmodifications together produced a jump in success rates from 30 per cent to 90 per cent for\nfive-year-olds and from 35 per cent to 72.5 per cent for four-year-olds. For three-year- olds,\nfor reasons that are still in need of clarification, no improvement—rather a slight drop in\nperformance - resulted from the change.\nWe may conclude, then, that children experience very real difficulty when faced with the\nKendler apparatus; but this difficulty cannot be taken as proof that they are incapable of\ndeductive reasoning.\n \n2",
