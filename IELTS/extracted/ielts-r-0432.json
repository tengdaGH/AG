  "passage_text": "Reading Practice\n \nThe Ant and the Mandarin\nIn 1476, the farmers of Berne in Switzerland decided there was only one way to rid their\nfields of the cutworms attacking their crops. They took the pests to court. The worms were\ntried, found guilty and excommunicated by the archbishop. In China, farmers had a more\npractical approach to pest control. Rather than relying on divine intervention, they put their\nfaith in frogs, ducks and ants. Frogs and ducks were encouraged to snap up the pests in\nthe paddies and the occasional plague of locusts. But the notion of biological control began\nwith an ant. More specifically, it started with the predatory yellow citrus ant Oeco-phylla\nsmaragdina, which has been polishing off pests in the orange groves of southern China for\nat least 1,700 years. The yellow citrus ant is a type of weaver ant, which binds leaves and\ntwigs with silk to form a neat, tent-like nest. In the beginning, farmers made do with the odd\nants' nests here and there. But it wasn't long before growing demand led to the\ndevelopment of a thriving trade in nests and a new type of agriculture - ant farming.\nFor an insect that bites, the yellow citrus ant is remarkably popular. Even by ant standards,\nOecophylla smaragdina is a fearsome predator. It's big, runs fast and has a powerful nip -\npainful to humans but lethal to many of the insects that plague the orange groves of\nGuangdong and Guangxi in southern China. And for at least 17 centuries, Chinese orange\ngrowers have harnessed these six-legged killing machines to keep their fruit groves healthy\nand productive.\nCitrus fruits evolved in the Far East and the Chinese discovered the delights of their flesh\nearly on. As the ancestral home of oranges, lemons and pomelos, China also has the\ngreatest diversity of citrus pests. And the trees that produce the sweetest fruits, the\nmandarins - or kan - attract a host of plant-eating insects, from black ants and sap-sucking\nmealy bugs to leaf-devouring caterpillars. With so many enemies, fruit growers clearly had\nto have some way of protecting their orchards.\nThe West did not discover the Chinese orange growers' secret weapon until 1 the early\n20th century. At the time, Florida was suffering an epidemic of citrus canker and in 1915\nWalter Swingle, a plant physiologist working for the US Department of Agriculture, was sent\nto China in search of varieties of orange that were resistant to the disease. Swingle spent\nsome time studying the citrus orchards around Guangzhou, and there he came across the\nstory of the cultivated ant. These ants, he was told, were \"grown'' by the people of a small\nvillage nearby who sold them to the orange growers by the nestful.\nThe earliest report of citrus ants at work among the orange trees appeared in a book on\ntropical and subtropical botany written by Hsi Han in AD 304. \"The people of Chiao-Chih\nsell in their markets ants in bags of rush matting. The nests are like silk. The bags are all\nattached to twigs and leaves which, with the i ants inside the nests, are for sale. The ants\nare reddish-yellow in colour, bigger than ordinary ants. In the south, if the kan trees do not\nhave this kind of ant, the fruits will all be damaged by many harmful insects, and not a\nsingle fruit will be perfect.\"\nInitially, farmers relied on nests which they collected from the wild or bought in the market\nwhere trade in nests was brisk. \"It is said that in the south orange trees which are free of\nants will have wormy fruits. Therefore, people race to buy nests for their orange trees,\"\nwrote Liu Hsun in Strange Things Noted in the South in about 890.\n \n1\n\nThe business guickly became more sophisticated. From the 10th century, country people\nbegan to trap ants in artificial nests baited with fat. \"Fruit-growing families buy these ants\nfrom vendors who make a business of collecting and selling such creatures,\" wrote Chuang\nChi-Yu in 1130. \"They trap them by filling hogs' or sheep's bladders with fat and placing\nthem with the cavities open next to the ants' nests. They wait until the ants have migrated\ninto the bladders and take them away. This is known as 'rearing orange ants'.\" Farmers\nattached k the bladders to their trees, and in time the ants spread to other trees and built\nnew nests.\nBy the 17th century, growers were building bamboo walkways between their trees to speed\nthe colonisation of their orchards. The ants ran along these narrow bridges from one tree to\nanother and established nests \"by the hundreds of thousands”.\nDid it work? The orange growers clearly thought so. One authority, Chhii Ta-Chun, writing\nin 1700, stressed how important it was to keep the fruit trees free of insect pests, especially\ncaterpillars. \"It is essential to eliminate them so that the trees are not injured. But hand\nlabour is not nearly as efficient as ant power...\"\nSwingle was just as impressed. Yet despite his reports, many Western biologists were\nsceptical. In the West, the idea of using one insect to destroy another was new and highly\ncontroversial. The first breakthrough had come in 1888, when the infant orange industry in\nCalifornia had been saved from extinction by the Australian vedalia beetle. This beetle was\nthe only thing that had made any in- T roads into the explosion of cottony cushion scale\nthat was threatening to destroy the state's citrus crops. But, as Swingle now knew,\nCalifornia's \"first'' was nothing of the sort. The Chinese had been expert in biocontrol for\nmany centuries.\nThe long tradition of ants in the Chinese orchards only began to waver in the 1950s and\n1960s with the introduction of powerful organic insecticides. Although most fruit growers\nswitched to chemicals, a few hung onto their ants. Those who abandoned ants in favour of\nchemicals quickly became disillusioned. As costs soared and pests began to develop\nresistance to the chemicals, growers began to revive the old ant patrols in the late 1960s.\nThey had good reason to have faith in their insect workforce.\nResearch in the early 1960s showed that as long as there were enough ants in the trees,\nthey did an excellent job of dispatching some pests - mainly the larger insects - and had\nmodest success against others. Trees with yellow ants produced almost 20 per cent more\nhealthy leaves than those without. More recent trials have shown that these trees yield just\nas big a crop as those protected by expensive chemical sprays.\nOne apparent drawback of using ants - and one of the main reasons for the early\nscepticism by Western scientists - was that citrus ants do nothing to control mealy bugs,\nwaxy-coated scale insects which can do considerable damage to fruit trees. In fact, the\nants protect mealy bugs in exchange for the sweet honey-dew they secrete. The orange\ngrowers always denied this was a problem but Western scientists thought they knew better.\nResearch in the 1980s suggests that the growers were right all along. Where X mealy bugs\nproliferate under the ants' protection, they are usually heavily parasitised and this limits the\nharm they can do.\nOrange growers who rely on carnivorous ants rather than poisonous chemicals maintain a\nbetter balance of species in their orchards. While the ants deal with the bigger insect pests,\n \n2\n\nother predatory species keep down the numbers of smaller pests such as scale insects and\naphids. In the long run, ants do a lot less damage than chemicals - and they're certainly\nmore effective than excommunication.\n \n3",
