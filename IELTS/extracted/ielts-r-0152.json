  "passage_text": "Reading Practice\n \nEnvironmentally-Friendly! Vehicles\nA\nIn the early 1990s, the California Air Resources Board (CARB), the government of\nCalifornia’s “clean air agency”, began a push for more fuel-efficient, lower-emissions\nvehicles, with the ultimate goal being a move to zero-emissions vehicles such as electric\nvehicles. In response, automakers developed electric models, including the Chrysler\nTEVan, Ford Ranger EV pickup truck, GM EV1 and S10 EV pickup, Honda EV Plus\nhatchback, Nissan lithium-battery Altra EV miniwagon and Toyota RAV4 EV. Ford Fusion is\nmanufactured at Ford’s Hermosillo Stamping & Assembly plant, located in Sonora Mexico. I\nthought going green was supposed to provide the U.S. with more jobs.\nB\nThe automakers were accused of pandering to the wishes of CARB in order to continue to\nbe allowed to sell cars in the lucrative Californian market, while failing to adequately\npromote their electric vehicles in order to create the impression that the consumers were\nnot interested in the cars, all the while joining oil industry lobbyists in vigorously protesting\nCARB’s mandate. GM’s program came under particular scrutiny; in an unusual move,\nconsumers were not allowed to purchase EV1s, but were instead asked to sign closed-end\nleases, meaning that the cars had to be returned to GM at the end of the lease period, with\nno option to purchase, despite lesser interest in continuing to own the cars. Chrysler,\nToyota, and a group of GM dealers sued CARB in Federal court, leading to the eventual\nneutering of CARB’s ZEV Mandate.\nC\nAfter public protests by EV drivers’ groups upset by the repossession of their cars, Toyota\noffered the last 328 RAV4-EVs for sale to the general public during six months, up until\nNovember 22, 2002. Almost all other production electric cars were withdrawn from the\nmarket and were in some cases seen to have been destroyed by their manufactures.\nToyota continues to support the several hundred Toyota RAV4-EV in the hands of the\ngeneral public and in fleet usage. GM famously de-activated the few EV1s that were\ndonated to engineering schools and museums.\nD\nThroughout the 1990s, the appeal of fuel-efficient or environmentally friendly cars declined\namong Americans, who instead favored sport utility vehicles, which were affordable to\noperate despite their poor fuel efficiency thanks to lower gasoline prices. American\nautomakers chose to focus their product lines around the truck-based vehicles, which\nenjoyed larger profit margins than the smaller cars which were preferred in places like\nEurope or Japan. In 1999, the Honda Insight hybrid car became the first hybrid to be sold in\nNorth America since the little-known Woods hybrid of 1917.\nE\nIn 1995, Toyota debuted a hybrid concept car at the Tokyo Motor Show, with testing\nfollowing a year later. The first Prius, model NHW10, went on sale on December 10, 1997.\nIt was available only in Japan, though it has been imported privately to at least the United\n \n1\n\nKingdom, Australia, and New Zealand. The first-generation Prius, at its launch, became the\nworld’s first mass-produced gasoline-electric hybrid car. The NHW10 Prius styling\noriginated from California designers, who were selected over competing designs from other\nToyota design studios.\nF\nIn the United States, the NHW11 was the first Prius to be sold. The Prius was marketed\nbetween the smaller Corolla and the larger Camry. The published retail price of the car was\nUS$19,995. The NHW11 Prius became more powerful partly to satisfy the higher speeds\nand longer distances that Americans drive. Air conditioning and electric power steering\nwere standard equipment. The vehicle was the second mass-produced hybrid on the\nAmerican market, after the two-seat Honda Insight. While the larger Prius could seat five,\nits battery pack restricted cargo space.\nG\nHybrids, which featured a combined gasoline and electric powertrain, were seen as a\nbalance, offering an environmentally friendly image and improved fuel economy, without\nbeing hindered by the low range of electric vehicles, albeit at an increased price over\ncomparable gasoline cars. Sales were poor, the lack of interest attributed to the car’s small\nsize and the lack of necessity for a fuel-efficient car at the time. The 2000s energy crisis\nbrought renewed interest in hybrid and electric cars. In America, sales of the Toyota Prius\njumped, and a variety of automakers followed suit, releasing hybrid models of their own.\nSeveral began to produce new electric car prototypes, as consumers called for cars that\nwould free them from the fluctuations of oil prices.\nH\nIn 2000, Hybrid Technologies, later renamed Li-ion Motors, started manufacturing electric\ncars in Mooresville, North Carolina. There has been increasing controversy with Li-ion\nMotors though due to the ongoing ‘Lemon issues’ regarding their product. And their attempt\nto cover it up. California electric-car maker Tesla Motors began development in 2004 on\nthe Tesla Roadster, which was first delivered to customers in 2008. The Roadster\nremained the only highway-capable EV in serial production and available for sale until\n2010. Senior leaders at several large automakers, including Nissan and General Motors,\nhave stated that the Roadster was a catalyst which demonstrated that there is pent-up\nconsumer demand for more efficient vehicles. GM Vice Chairman Bob Lutz said in 2007\nthat the Tesla Roadster inspired him to push GM to develop the Chevrolet Volt, a plug-in\nhybrid sedan prototype that aims to reverse years of dwindling market share and massive\nfinancial losses for America’s largest automaker. In an August 2009 edition of The New\nYorker, Lutz was quoted as saying, “All the geniuses here at General Motors kept saying\nlithium-ion technology is 10 years away, and Toyota agreed with us – and boom, along\ncomes Tesla. So I said, ‘How come some tiny little California startup, run by guys who\nknow nothing about the car business, can do this, and we can’t?’ That was the crowbar that\nhelped break up the log jam.”\n \n2",
