  "passage_text": "Reading Practice\n \nWhy Do We Touch Strangers So Much? A History Of\nThe Handshake Offers Clues\n \nFor thousands of years, the handshake has been used for different purposes.\nA. There is a lot that can be conveyed in a handshake, a kiss, or a hug. Throughout\nhistory, such a greeting was used to signal friendship, finalize a business transaction,\nor indicate religious devotion. Touching strangers, however, can also transmit other,\nless beneficial shared outcomes—like disease outbreaks.\nAs fears about COVID-19, or coronavirus, mount, France has warned its citizens to\npause their famous cheek kisses, and across the world, business deals are being\nsealed with an elbow bump. But with histories tracing back thousands of years, both\ngreetings are likely too entrenched to be so easily halted.\nB. A popular theory on the handshake’s origin is that it began as a gesture of peace.\nGrasping hands proved one was not holding a weapon—and shaking them was a\nway to ensure a partner had nothing hiding up their sleeve. So far, there has not been\nany reliable evidence to prove this assumption. Throughout the ancient world, the\nhandshake appears on vases, gravestones, and stone slabs in scenes of weddings,\ngods making deals, young warriors departing for war, and the newly dead’s arrival to\nthe afterlife. In the literary canon, it stretches to the Iliad and the Odyssey.\nThe handshake’s catch-all utility, used in friendship, romance, and business alike,\nmakes interpretation difficult. “The handshake continues to be a popular image today\nbecause we too see it as a complex and ambiguous motif,” writes art historian Glenys\nDavies in an analysis of its use in classical art.\nC. In America, it is likely that the handshake’s popularity was propelled by 18th century\nQuakers. In their efforts to eschew the hierarchy and social rank, they found the\nhandshake a more democratic form of greeting to the then-common bow, curtsy, or\nhat doffing. “In their place, Quakers put the practice of the handshake, extended to\neveryone regardless of station, as we still do,” writes historian Michael Zuckerman.\nThere may be a scientific explanation for its lasting power. In a 2015 study,\nresearchers in Israel filmed handshakes between hundreds of strangers and found\nnearly a quarter of participants sniffed their hands afterwards. They theorized that a\nhandshake might be unconsciously used to detect chemical signals, and possibly as\na means of communication—just as other animals do by smelling each other.\nD. The kiss-as-greeting has a similarly rich history. It was incorporated into early\nChristianity and used in religious ceremonies. “In his Epistle to the Romans, St. Paul\ninstructed followers to ‘salute one another with a holy kiss,’” writes Andy Scott in the\nbook One Kiss or Two: In Search of the Perfect Greeting. In the Middle Ages, a kiss\nwas used as a sign of fidelity and to seal agreements like property transfers.\nE.\nin much of the world.
