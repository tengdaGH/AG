  "passage_text": "Reading Practice\nCaral: an ancient South American city\nHuge earth and rock mounds rise out of the desert of the Supe Valley near the coast of\nPeru in South America. These immense mounds appear simply to be part of the\ngeographical landscape in this arid region squeezed between the Pacific Ocean and the\nAndes mountains.But looks deceive. These are actually human-made pyramids strong\nevidence indicates they are the remains of a city known as Caral that flourished nearly\n5,000 years ago. It true, it would be the oldest known urban center in the America and\namong the most ancient in the world.\nResearch undertaken by Peruvian archaeologist Ruth Shady suggests that the 150-acre\nplex of pyramids, plazas and residential buildings was a thriving metropolis when Egypt's\ngreat pyramids were still being built. Though discovered in 1905, for years Caral attracted\nlittle attention, largely because archaeologists believed the structures were rainy recent.\nBut the monumental scale of the pyramids had long interested Shady, who began\nexcavations at the site in 1996, about 22 kilometers from the coast and 190 kilometers\nnorth of Peru's capital city of Lima.\nShady and her crew searched for broken remains of the pots and containers that most\nsuch sites contain. Not finding any only made her more excited: it meant Caral could be\nwhat archaeologists term pre-ceramic, that is, existing before the advent in the area of pot-\nfiring techniques. Shady's team undertook the task of excavating Piramide Mayor, the\nlargest of the pyramids. After carefully clearing away many hundreds of years' worth of\nrubble and sand, they identified staircases, walls covered with remnants of colored plaster,\nand brickwork. In the foundations, they found the remains of grass-like reeds woven into\nbags. The original workers, she surmised, must have filled these bags with stones from a\nnearby quarry and laid them atop one another inside retaining walls, gradually giving rise to\nthe pyramid's immense structure. Shady had samples of the reeds subjected to\nradiocarbon dating and found that the reeds were 4,600 years old. This evidence indicated\nthat Caral was, in fact, more than 1,000 years older than what had previously been thought\nto be the oldest urban center in the Americas.\nWhat amazed archaeologists was not just the age, but the complexity and scope of Caral.\nPiramide Mayor alone covers an area nearly the size of four football fields and is 18 meters\ntall. A nine-meter-wide staircase rises from a circular plaza at the foot of the pyramid,\npassing over three terraced levels until it reaches the top. Thousands of manual laborers\nwould have been needed to build such a project, not counting the many architects,\ncraftsmen, and managers. Shady's team found the remains of a large amphitheater,\ncontaining almost 70 musical instruments made of bird and deer bones Clearly music\nplaved an important role in Caral's society. Around the perimeter of Caral are a series of\nsmaller mounds and various buildings. These indicate a hierarchy of living arrangements:\nlarge, well-kept rooms atop pyramids for the elite, ground-level quarters for shabbier\noutlying dwellings for workers\nBut why had Caral been built in the first place? Her excavations convinced Shady that\nCaral once served as a trade center for the region, which extends from the rainforests of\nthe Amazon to the high forests of the Andes. Shady found evidence of a rich trading\nenvironment, including seeds of the cocoa bush and necklaces of shells, neither of which\nwas native to the immediate Caral area. This environment gave rise to people who did not\n \n1\n\ntake part in the production of food, allowing them to become priests and planners, builders\nand designers. Thus occupational specialization, elemental to an urban society, emerged.\nBut what sustained such a trading center and drew travelers to it? Was it food? Shady and\nher team found the bones of small edible fish, which must have come from the Pacific\ncoast to the west, in the excavations. But they also found evidence of squash, sweet\npotatoes and beans having been grown locally. Shady theorized that Caral's early farmers\ndiverted the area's rivers into canals, which still cross the Supe Valley today, to irrigate\ntheir fields.But because she found no traces of maize, which can be traded or stored and\nused in times of crop failure, she concluded that Caral's trade leverage was not based on\nstockpiling food supplies.\nIt was evidence of another crop in the excavations that gave Shady the best clue to Caral’s\nsuccess. In nearly every excavated building, her team discovered evidence of cotton -\nseeds, fibers and textiles. Her theory fell into place when a large fishing net made of those\nfibers, unearthed in an unrelated dig on Peru's coast, turned out to be as old as Caral. 'The\nfarmers of Caral grew the cotton that the fishermen needed to make their nets, Shady\nspeculates. And the fishermen gave them shellfish and dried fish in exchange for these\nnets.' In essence, the people of Caral enabled fishermen to work with larger and more\neffective nets, which made the resources of the sea more readily available, and the\nfishermen probably used dried squash grown by the Caral people as flotation devices for\ntheir nets.\n \n2",
