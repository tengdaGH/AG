  "passage_text": "Reading Practice\n \nSAVING LANGUAGE\nFor the first time, linguists have put a price on language. To save a language from\nextinction isn’t cheap - but more and more people are arguing that the alternative is\nthe death of communities\nThere is nothing unusual about a single language dying. Communities have come and\ngone throughout history, and with them their language. But what is happening today is\nextraordinary, judged by the standards of the past. It is language extinction on a massive\nscale. According to the best estimates, there are some 6,000 languages in the world. Of\nthese, about half are going to die out in the course of the next century: that’s 3,000\nlanguages in 1,200 months. On average, there is a language dying out somewhere in the\nworld every two weeks or so.\nHow do we know? In the course of the past two or three decades, linguists all over the\nworld have been gathering comparative data. If they find a language with just a few\nspeakers left, and nobody is bothering to pass the language on to the children, they\nconclude that language is bound to die out soon. And we have to draw the same\nconclusion if a language has less than 100 speakers. It is not likely to last very long. A\n1999 survey shows that 97 per cent of the world’s languages are spoken by just four per\ncent of the people.\nIt is too late to do anything to help many languages, where the speakers are too few or too\nold, and where the community is too busy just trying to survive to care about their\nlanguage. But many languages are not in such a serious position. Often, where languages\nare seriously endangered, there are things that can be done to give new life to them. It is\ncalled revitalisation.\nOnce a community realises that its language is in danger, it can start to introduce\nmeasures which can genuinely revitalise. The community itself must want to save its\nlanguage. The culture of which it is a part must need to have a respect for minority\nlanguages. There needs to be funding, to support courses, materials, and teachers. And\nthere need to be linguists, to get on with the basic task of putting the language down on\npaper. That’s the bottom line: getting the language documented - recorded, analysed,\nwritten down. People must be able to read and write if they and their language are to have\na future in an increasingly computer- literate civilisation.\nBut can we save a few thousand languages, just like that? Yes, if the will and funding were\navailable. It is not cheap, getting linguists into the field, training local analysts, supporting\nthe community with language resources and teachers, compiling grammars and\ndictionaries, writing materials for use in schools. It takes time, lots of it, to revitalise an\nendangered language. Conditions vary so much that it is difficult to generalise, but a figure\nof $ 100,000 a year per language cannot be far from the truth. If we devoted that amount of\neffort over three years for each of 3,000 languages, we would be talking about some $900\nmillion.\nThere are some famous cases which illustrate what can be done. Welsh, alone among the\nCeltic languages, is not only stopping its steady decline towards extinction but showing\nsigns of real growth. Two Language Acts protect the status of Welsh now, and its presence\nis increasingly in evidence wherever you travel in Wales.\n \n1\n\nOn the other side of the world, Maori in New Zealand has been maintained by a system of\nso- called ‘language nests’, first introduced in 1982. These are organisations which provide\nchildren under five with a domestic setting in which they are intensively exposed to the\nlanguage. The staff are all Maori speakers from the local community. The hope is that the\nchildren will keep their Maori skills alive after leaving the nests, and that as they grow older\nthey will in turn become role models to a new generation of young children. There are\ncases like this all over the world. And when the reviving language is associated with a\ndegree of political autonomy, the growth can be especially striking, as shown by Faroese,\nspoken in the Faroe Islands, after the islanders received a measure of autonomy from\nDenmark.\nIn Switzerland, Romansch was facing a difficult situation, spoken in five very different\ndialects, with small and diminishing numbers, as young people left their community for work\nin the German-speaking cities. The solution here was the creation in the 1980s of a unified\nwritten language for all these dialects. Romansch Grischun, as it is now called, has official\nstatus in parts of Switzerland, and is being increasingly used in spoken form on radio and\ntelevision.\nA language can be brought back from the very brink of extinction. The Ainu language of\nJapan, after many years of neglect and repression, had reached a stage where there were\nonly eight fluent speakers left, all elderly. However, new government policies brought fresh\nattitudes and a positive interest in survival. Several ‘semispeakers’ - people who had\nbecome unwilling to speak Ainu because of the negative attitudes by Japanese speakers -\nwere prompted to become active speakers again. There is fresh interest now and the\nlanguage is more publicly available than it has been for years.\nIf good descriptions and materials are available, even extinct languages can be\nresurrected. Kaurna, from South Australia, is an example. This language had been extinct\nfor about a century, but had been quite well documented. So, when a strong movement\ngrew for its revival, it was possible to reconstruct it. The revised language is not the same\nas the original, of course. It lacks the range that the original had, and much of the old\nvocabulary. But it can nonetheless act as a badge of present-day identity for its people.\nAnd as long as people continue to value it as a true marker of their identity, and are\nprepared to keep using it, it will develop new functions and new vocabulary, as any other\nliving language would do.\nIt is too soon to predict the future of these revived languages, but in some parts of the\nworld they are attracting precisely the range of positive attitudes and grass roots support\nwhich are the preconditions for language survival. In such unexpected but heart-warming\nways might we see the grand total of languages in the world minimally increased.\n \n2",
