One of\nits latest ventures, the Sydney Airport hotel (SAH), opened in March 1995. The hotel is the\nclosest to Sydney Airport and is designed to provide the best available accommodation,\nfood and beverage and meeting facilities in Sydney's southern suburbs. Similar to many\ninternational hotel chains, however, AHI has experienced difficulties in Australia in\nproviding long-term profits for hotel owners, as a result of the country's high labour-cost\nstructure. In order to develop an economically viable hotel organisation model, AHI decided\nto implement some new policies and practices at SAH.\nThe first of the initiatives was an organisational structure with only three levels of\nmanagement - compared to the traditional seven. Partly as a result of this change, there\nare 25 per cent fewer management positions, enabling a significant saving. This change\nalso has other implications. Communication, both up and down the organisation, has\ngreatly improved. Decision-making has been forced down in many cases to front-line\nemployees. As a result, guest requests are usually met without reference to a supervisor,\nimproving both customer and employee satisfaction.\nThe hotel also recognised that it would need a different approach to selecting employees\nwho would fit in with its new policies. In its advertisements, the hotel stated a preference for\npeople with some 'service' experience in order to minimise traditional work practices being\nintroduced into the hotel. Over 7000 applicants filled in application forms for the 120 jobs\ninitially offered at SAH. The balance of the positions at the hotel (30 management and 40\nshift leader positions) were predominantly filled by transfers from other AHI properties.\nA series of tests and interviews were conducted with potential employees, which eventually\nleft 280 applicants competing for the 120 advertised positions. After the final interview,\npotential recruits were divided into three categories. Category A was for applicants\nexhibiting strong leadership qualities, Category C was for applicants perceived to be\nfollowers, and Category B was for applicants with both leader and follower qualities.\nDepartment heads and shift leaders then composed prospective teams using a\ncombination of people from all three categories. Once suitable teams were formed, offers\nof employment were made to team members.\nAnother major initiative by SAH was to adopt a totally multi-skilled workforce. Although\nthere may be some limitations with highly technical jobs such as cooking or maintenance,\nwherever possible, employees at SAH are able to work in a wide variety of positions. A\nmulti-skilled workforce provides far greater management flexibility during peak and quiet\ntimes to transfer employees to needed positions. For example, when office staff are away\non holidays during quiet periods of the year, employees in either food or beverage or\nhousekeeping departments can temporarily.\nThe most crucial way, however, of improving the labour cost structure at SAH was to find\nbetter, more productive ways of providing customer service. SAH management concluded\nthis would first require a process of 'benchmarking'. The prime objective of the\nbenchmarking process was to compare a range of service delivery processes across a\n \n1\n\nrange of criteria using teams made up of employees from different departments within the\nhotel which interacted with each other. This process resulted in performance measures that\ngreatly enhanced SAH's ability to improve productivity and quality.\nThe front office team discovered through this project that a high proportion of AHI Club\nmember reservations were incomplete. As a result, the service provided to these guests\nwas below the standard promised to them as part of their membership agreement.\nReducing the number of incomplete reservations greatly improved guest perceptions of\nservice.\nIn addition, a program modelled on an earlier project called 'Take Charge' was\nimplemented. Essentially, Take Charge provides an effective feedback loop horn both\ncustomers and employees. Customer comments, both positive and negative, are recorded\nby staff. These are collated regularly to identify opportunities for improvement. Just as\nimportantly, employees are requested to note down their own suggestions for\nimprovement. (AHI has set an expectation that employees will submit at least three\nsuggestions for every one they receive from a customer.)\nEmployee feedback is reviewed daily and suggestions are implemented within 48 hours, if\npossible, or a valid reason is given for non-implementation. If suggestions require analysis\nor data collection, the Take Charge team has 30 days in which to address the issue and\ncome up with recommendations.\nAlthough quantitative evidence of AHI's initiatives at SAH are limited at present, anecdotal\nevidence clearly suggests that these practices are working. Indeed AHI is progressively\nrolling out these initiatives in other hotels in Australia, whilst numerous overseas visitors\nhave come to see how the program works.\nThis article has been adapted and condensed fem the article by R Carter (19%),\n'Implementing the cycle of success: A case study of the Sheraten Pacific Division', Asia\nPacific Journal of Human Resources, 34(3): 111-23.
