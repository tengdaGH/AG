  "passage_text": "Reading Practice\nHow should reading be taught?\nHow should reading be taught?\nBy Keith Rayncr a Barbara R Foorman\nA\nLearning to speak is automatic for almost all children, but learning to read requires\nelaborate instruction and conscious effort. Well aware of the difficulties, educators have\ngiven a great deal of thought to how they can best help children learn to read. No single\nmethod has triumphed. Indeed, heated arguments about the most appropriate form of\nreading instruction continue to polarize the teaching community.\nB\n \nThree general approaches have been tried. In one, called whole-word instruction, children\nlearn by rote how to recognise at a glance a vocabulary of 50 to 100 words. Then they\ngradually acquire other words, often through seeing them used over and over again in the\ncontext of a story.\nSpeakers of most languages learn the relationship between letters and the sounds\nassociated with them (phonemes). That is, children are taught how to use their knowledge\nof the alphabet to sound out words. This procedure constitutes a second approach to\nteaching reading – phonics.\nMany schools have adopted a different approach: the whole-language method. The\nstrategy here relies on the child’s experience with the language. For example, students are\noffered engaging books and are encouraged to guess the words that they do not know by\nconsidering the context of the sentence or by looking for clues in the storyline and\nillustrations, rather than trying to sound them out.\nMany teachers adopted the whole-language approach because of its intuitive appeal.\nMaking reading fun promises to keep children motivated, and learning to read depends\nmore on what the student does than on what the teacher does. The presumed benefits of\nwhole-language instruction – and the contrast to the perceived dullness of phonics – led to\nits growing acceptance across American during the 1990s and a movement away from\nphonics.\nC\nHowever, many linguists and psychologists objected strongly to the abandonment of\nphonics in American schools. Why was this so? In short, because research had clearly\ndemonstrated that understanding how letters related to the component sounds in words is\ncritically important in reading. This conclusion rests, in part, on knowledge of how\nexperienced readers make sense of words on a page. Advocates of whole-language\ninstruction have argued forcefully that people often derive meanings directly from print\nwithout ever determining the sound of the word. Some psychologists today accept this\nview, but most believe that reading is typically a process of rapidly sounding out words\n \n1\n\nmentally. Compelling evidence for this comes from experiments which show that subjects\noften confuse homophones (words that sound the same, such as Jrose and ‘rows5). This\nsupports the idea that readers convert strings of letters to sounds.\nD\nIn order to evaluate different approaches to teaching reading, a number of experiments\nhave been carried out, firstly with college students, then with school pupils. Investigators\ntrained English-speaking college students to read using unfamiliar symbols such as Arabic\nletters (the phonics approach), while another group learned entire words associated with\ncertain strings of Arabic letters (whole-word). Then both groups were required to read a\nnew set of words constructed from the original characters. In general, readers who were\ntaught the rules of phonics could read many more new words than those trained with a\nwhole-word procedure.\nClassroom studies comparing phonics with either whole-word or whole-language\ninstruction are also quite illuminating. One particularly persuasive study compared two\nprogrammes used in 20 first-grade classrooms. Half the students were offered traditional\nreading instruction, which included the use of phonics drills and applications. The other half\nwere taught using an individualised method that drew from their experiences with\nlanguages; these children produce their own booklets of stories and developed sets of\nwords to be recognised (common components of the whole-language approach). This\nstudy found that the first group scored higher at year’s end on tests of reading and\ncomprehension.\nE\nIf researchers are so convinced about the need for phonics instruction, why does the\ndebate continue? Because the controversy is enmeshed in the philosophical differences\nbetween traditional and progressive (or new) approaches, differences that have divided\neducators for years. The progressive challenge the results of laboratory tests and\nclassroom studies on the basis of a broad philosophical skepticism about the values of\nsuch research. They champion student-centred learned and teacher empowerment. Sadly,\nthey fail to realise that these very admirable educational values are equally consistent with\nthe teaching of phonics.\nF\nIf schools of education insisted that would-be reading teachers learned something about\nthe vast research in linguistics and psychology that bears on reading, their graduates would\nbe more eager to use phonics and would be prepared to do so effectively. They could allow\ntheir pupils to apply the principles of phonics while reading for pleasure. Using whole-\nlanguage activities to supplement phonics instruction certainly helps to make reading fun\nand meaningful for children, so no one would want to see such tools discarded. Indeed,\nrecent work has indicated that the combination of literature-based instruction and phonics\nis more powerful than either method used alone.\nTeachers need to strike a balance. But in doing so, we urge them to remember that reading\nmust be grounded in a firm understanding of the connections between letters and sounds.\nEducators who deny this reality are neglecting decades of research. They are also\nneglecting the needs of their students.\n \n2",
