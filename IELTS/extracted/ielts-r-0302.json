  "passage_text": "Reading Practice\n \nMusic: Language We All Speak\nMusic is one of the human species' relatively few universal abilities. Without formal training,\nany individual, from Stone Age tribesman to suburban teenager, has the ability to recognise\nmusic and, in some fashion, to make it. Why this should be so is a mystery. After all, music\nisn't necessary for getting through the day, and if it aids in reproduction, it does so only in\nhighly indirect ways. Language, by contrast, is also everywhere - but for reasons that are\nmore obvious. With language, you and the members of your tribe can organise a migration\nacross Africa, build reed boats and cross the seas, and communicate at night even when\nyou can't see each other. Modern culture, in all its technological extravagance, springs\ndirectly from the human talent for manipulating symbols and syntax. \nScientists have always been intrigued by the connection between music and language. Yet\nover the years, words and melody have acquired a vastly different status in the lab and the\nseminar room. While language has long been considered essential to unlocking the\nmechanisms of human intelligence, music is generally treated as an evolutionary frippery -\nmere \"auditory cheesecake\", as the Harvard cognitive scientist Steven Pinker puts it.\nSection B \nBut thanks to a decade-long wave of neuroscience research, that tune is changing. A flurry\nof recent publications suggests that language and music may equally be able to tell us who\nwe are and where we're from - not just emotionally, but biologically. In July, the journal\nNature Neuroscience devoted a special issue to the topic. And in an article in the 6 August\nissue of the Journal of Neuroscience, David Schwartz, Catherine Howe, and Dale Purves\nof Duke University argued that the sounds of music and the sounds of language are\nintricately connected. \nTo grasp the originality of this idea, it's necessary to realise two things about how music\nhas traditionally been understood. First, musicologists have long emphasised that while\neach culture stamps a special identity onto its music, music itself has some universal\nqualities. For example, in virtually all cultures, sound is divided into some or all of the 12\nintervals that make up the chromatic scale -that is, the scale represented by the keys on a\npiano. For centuries, observers have attributed this preference for certain combinations of\ntones to the mathematical properties of sound itself. \nSome 2,500 years ago, Pythagoras was the first to note a direct relationship between the\nharmoniousness of a tone combination and the physical dimensions of the object that\nproduced it. For example, a plucked string will always play an octave lower than a similar\nstring half its size, and a fifth lower than a similar string two thirds its length. This link\nbetween simple ratios and harmony has influenced music theory ever since.\nSection C \nThis music-is-math idea is often accompanied by the notion that music, formally speaking\nat least, exists apart from the world in which it was created. Writing recently in The New\nYork Review of Books, pianist and critic Charles Rosen discussed the long-standing notion\nthat while painting and sculpture reproduce at least some aspects of the natural world, and\nwriting describes thoughts and feelings we are all familiar with, music is entirely abstracted\nfrom the world in which we live. Neither idea is right, according to David Schwartz and his\n \n1\n\ncolleagues. Human musical preferences are fundamentally shaped not by elegant\nalgorithms or ratios but by the messy sounds of real life, and of speech in particular – which\nin turn is shaped by our evolutionary heritage. \"The explanation of music, like the\nexplanation of any product of the mind, must be rooted in biology, not in numbers per se,\"\nsays Schwartz. \nSchwartz, Howe, and Purves analysed a vast selection of speech sounds from a variety of\nlanguages to reveal the underlying patterns common to all utterances. In order to focus\nonly on the raw sounds, they discarded all theories about speech and meaning, and sliced\nsentences into random bites. Using a database of over 100,000 brief segments of speech,\nthey noted which frequency had the greatest emphasis in each sound. The resulting set of\nfrequencies, they discovered, corresponded closely to the chromatic scale. In short, the\nbuilding blocks of music are to be found in speech.\nFar from being abstract, music presents a strange analogue to the patterns created by the\nsounds of speech. \"Music, like visual arts, is rooted in our experience of the natural world,\"\nsays Schwartz. \"It emulates our sound environment in the way that visual arts emulate the\nvisual environment.\" In music we hear the echo of our basic sound-making instrument - the\nvocal tract. The explanation for human music is simpler still than Pythagoras's\nmathematical equations: We like the sounds that are familiar to us - specifically, we like the\nsounds that remind us of us. \nThis brings up some chicken-or-egg evolutionary questions. It may be that music imitates\nspeech directly, the researchers say, in which case it would seem that language evolved\nfirst. It's also conceivable that music came first and language is in effect an imitation of\nsong - that in everyday speech we hit the musical notes we especially like. Alternately, it\nmay be that music imitates the general products of the human sound-making system,\nwhich just happens to be mostly speech. \"We can't know this,\" says Schwartz. \"What we\ndo know is that they both come from the same system, and it is this that shapes our\npreferences.\"\nSection D \nSchwartz's study also casts light on the long-running question of whether animals\nunderstand or appreciate music. Despite the apparent abundance of \"music\" in the natural\nworld - birdsong, whalesong, wolf howls, synchronised chimpanzee hooting - previous\nstudies have found that many laboratory animals don't show a great affinity for the human\nvariety of music making. \nMarc Hauser and Josh McDermott of Harvard argued in the July issue of Nature\nNeuroscience that animals don't create or perceive music the way we do. The fact that\nlaboratory monkeys can show recognition of human tunes is evidence, they say, of shared\ngeneral features of the auditory system, not any specific chimpanzee musical ability. As for\nbirds, those most musical beasts, they generally recognise their own tunes - a narrow\nrepertoire - but don't generate novel melodies like we do. There are no avian Mozarts.\n But what's been played to animals, Schwartz notes, is human music. If animals evolve\npreferences for sound as we do - based upon the soundscape in which they live - then their\n\"music\" would be fundamentally different from ours. In the same way our scales derive\nfrom human utterances, a cat's idea of a good tune would derive from yowls and meows.\nTo demonstrate that animals don't appreciate sound the way we do, we'd need evidence\nthat they don't respond to \"music\" constructed from their own sound environment.\n \n2\n\nSection E \nNo matter how the connection between language and music is parsed, what is apparent is\nthat our sense of music, even our love for it, is as deeply rooted in our biology and in our\nbrains as language is. This is most obvious with babies, says Sandra Trehub at the\nUniversity of Toronto, who also published a paper in the Nature Neuroscience special\nissue. \nFor babies, music and speech are on a continuum. Mothers use musical speech to\n\"regulate infants' emotional states\", Trehub says. Regardless of what language they speak,\nthe voice all mothers use with babies is the same: \"something between speech and song\".\nThis kind of communication \"puts the baby in a trancelike state, which may proceed to\nsleep or extended periods of rapture\". So if the babies of the world could understand the\nlatest research on language and music, they probably wouldn't be very surprised. The\nupshot, says Trehub, is that music may be even more of a necessity than we realise.\n \n3",
