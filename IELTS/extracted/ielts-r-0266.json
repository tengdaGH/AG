  "passage_text": "Reading Practice\n \nMagnetic Therapy\nA\n \nMagnetic therapy, which is a $5-billion market worldwide, is a form of alternative medicine\nwhich claims that magnetic fields have healing powers. Magnetic devices that are claimed\nto be therapeutic include magnetic bracelets, insoles, wrist and knee bands, back and neck\nbraces, and even pillows and mattresses. Their annual sales are estimated at $300 million\nin the United States and more than a billion dollars globally. They have been advertised to\ncure a vast array of ills, particularly pain.\n \n \nB\nThe therapy works on the principle of balancing electrical energy in the body by pulsating\nmagnetic waves through different parts of the body. The electrical currents generated by\nmagnets increase the blood flow and oxygen which helps to heal many of the ailments. The\nnatural effects of the Earth’s magnetic field are considered to play an essential role in the\nhealth of humans and animals. It is generally accepted that our body draws some benefit\nfrom the Earth’s magnetic field. To restore the balance within our body allows us to function\nat our optimum level. For example, when the first astronauts returned to earth sick, NASA\nconcluded that their illness resulted from the lack of a planetary magnetic field in outer\nspace. To resolve the problem, NASA placed magnets in the astronauts’ space suits and\nspace travel vehicles, and astronauts have returned to Earth healthy ever since.\nC\nHistorically it is reported that magnets have been around for an extremely long time. The\ntherapeutic power of magnets was known to physicians in ancient Greece, Egypt and\nChina over 4000 years ago, who used naturally magnetic rock – lodestone – to treat a\nvariety of physical and psychological ailments. Cleopatra the beautiful Egyptian queen was\nprobably the first celebrity to use magnets. It is documented that in order to prevent from\naging, she slept on a Lodestone to keep her skin youthful. Ancient Romans also used\nmagnet therapy to treat eye disease.\nD\nThe popularity of magnet therapy in the United States began to rise during the 1800s and\nsoared in the post-Civil War era. Sears-Roebuck advertised magnetic jewelry in its catalog\nfor the healing of virtually any ailment. An Austrian psychoanalyst by the name of Wilhelm\nReich immigrated to the United States in 1939 and researched the effects of\nelectromagnetism on humans. Today, Germany, Japan, Israel, Russia and at least 45 other\ncountries consider magnetic therapy to be an official medical procedure for the treatment of\nnumerous ailments, including various inflammatory and neurological problems.\nE\nFor those who practice magnetic therapy, strongly believe that certain ailments can be\n \n1\n\ntreated if the patient is exposed to magnetic fields while at the same time there is a strong\nresentment from the medical establishment and critics claim that most magnets don’t have\nthe strength to affect the various organs and tissues within the body and it is a product of\nPseudoscience and is not based on proper research and analysis. There are few reported\ncomplications of magnetic therapy and the World Health Organization says a low level of\nmagnetic energy is not harmful. Documented side effects are not life-threatening and\ninclude pain, nausea and dizziness that disappeared when the magnets were removed. If\nconsidering magnet therapy, as with any medical treatment, it is always advisable to\nconsult one’s regular physician first. Magnet therapy is gaining popularity; however,\nscientific evidence to support the success of this therapy is lacking. More scientifically\nsound studies are needed in order to fully understand the effects that magnets can have on\nthe body and the possible benefits or dangers that could result from their use.\nF\nResearchers at Baylor University Medical Center recently conducted a double-blind study\non the use of concentric-circle magnets to relieve chronic pain in 50 post-polio patients. A\nstatic magnetic device or a placebo device was applied to the patient’s skin for 45 minutes.\nThe patients were asked to rate how much pain they experienced when a “trigger point was\ntouched.” The researchers reported that the 29 patients exposed to the magnetic device\nachieved lower pain scores than did the 21 who were exposed to the placebo device.\nHowever, this study had significant flaws in their design. Although the groups were said to\nbe selected randomly, the ratio of women to men in the experimental group was twice that\nof the control group; the age of the placebo group was four years higher than that of the\ncontrol group; there were just one brief exposure and no systematic follow-up of patients.\nG\nMagnet therapy is gaining popularity; however, scientific evidence to support the success\nof this therapy is lacking.
