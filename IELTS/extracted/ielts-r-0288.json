  "passage_text": "Reading Practice\n \n \nMigratory Beekeeping\nTaking Wing\nTo eke out a full-time living from their honeybees, about half the nation’s 2,000\ncommercial beekeepers pull up stakes each spring, migrating north to find more\nflowers for their bees. Besides turning floral nectar into honey, these hardworking\ninsects also pollinate crops for farmers -for a fee. As autumn approaches, the\nbeekeepers pack up their hives and go south, scrambling for pollination contracts in\nhot spots like California’s fertile Central Valley.\nOf the 2,000 commercial beekeepers in the United States about half migrate This pays off\nin two ways Moving north in the summer and south in the winter lets bees work a longer\nblooming season, making more honey — and money — for their keepers. Second,\nbeekeepers can carry their hives to farmers who need bees to pollinate their crops. Every\nspring a migratory beekeeper in California may move up to 160 million bees to flowering\nfields in Minnesota and every winter his family may haul the hives back to California, where\nfarmers will rent the bees to pollinate almond and cherry trees.\nMigratory beekeeping is nothing new. The ancient Egyptians moved clay hives, probably\non rafts, down the Nile to follow the bloom and nectar flow as it moved toward Cairo. In the\n1880s North American beekeepers experimented with the same idea, moving bees on\nbarges along the Mississippi and on waterways in Florida, but their lighter, wooden hives\nkept falling into the water. Other keepers tried the railroad and horse- drawn wagons, but\nthat didn’t prove practical. Not until the 1920s when cars and trucks became affordable and\nroads improved, did migratory beekeeping begin to catch on.\nFor the Californian beekeeper, the pollination season begins in February. At this time, the\nbeehives are in particular demand by farmers who have almond groves; they need two\nhives an acre. For the three-week long bloom, beekeepers can hire out their hives for $32\neach. It’s a bonanza for the bees too. Most people consider almond honey too bitter to eat\nso the bees get to keep it for themselves.\nBy early March it is time to move the bees. It can take up to seven nights to pack the 4,000\nor so hives that a beekeeper may own. These are not moved in the middle of the day\nbecause too many of the bees would end up homeless. But at night, the hives are stacked\nonto wooden pallets, back-to-back in sets of four, and lifted onto a truck. It is not necessary\nto wear gloves or a beekeeper’s veil because the hives are not being opened and the bees\nshould remain relatively quiet. Just in case some are still lively, bees can be pacified with a\nfew puffs of smoke blown into each hive’s narrow entrance.\nIn their new location, the beekeeper will pay the farmer to allow his bees to feed in such\nplaces as orange groves. The honey produced here is fragrant and sweet and can be sold\nby the beekeepers. To encourage the bees to produce as much honey as possible during\nthis period, the beekeepers open the hives and stack extra boxes called supers on top.\nThese temporary hive extensions contain frames of empty comb for the bees to fill with\nhoney. In the brood chamber below, the bees will stash honey to eat later. To prevent the\n \n1\n\nqueen from crawling up to the top and laying eggs, a screen can be inserted between the\nbrood chamber and the supers. Three weeks later the honey can be gathered.\nFoul smelling chemicals are often used to irritate the bees and drive them down into the\nhive’s bottom boxes, leaving the honey- filled supers more or less bee free. These can then\nbe pulled off the hive. They are heavy with honey and may weigh up to 90 pounds each.\nThe supers are taken to a warehouse. In the extracting room, the frames are lilted out and\nlowered into an “uncapper” where rotating blades shave away the wax that covers each\ncell. The uncapped frames are put in a carousel that sits on the bottom of a large stainless\nsteel drum. The carousel is filled to capacity with 72 frames. A switch is flipped and the\nframes begin to whirl at 300 revolutions per minute; centrifugal force throws the honey out\nof the combs. Finally the honey is poured into barrels for shipment.\nAfter this, approximately a quarter of the hives weakened by disease, mites, or an ageing\nor dead queen, will have to be replaced. To create new colonies, a healthy double hive,\nteeming with bees, can be separated into two boxes. One half will hold the queen and a\nyoung, already mated queen can be put in the other half, to make two hives from one. By\nthe time the flowers bloom, the new queens will be laying eggs, filling each hive with young\nworker bees. The beekeeper’s family will then migrate with them to their summer location.\nAdapted from “America's Beekeepers: Hives for Hire” by Alan Mairson, National\nGeographic.\n \n2",
