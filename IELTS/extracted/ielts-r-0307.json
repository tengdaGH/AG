  "passage_text": "Reading Practice\n \nNature works for Nature Work PLA\nA\nA dozen years ago, scientists at Cargill got the idea of converting lactic acid made from\ncorn into plastic while examining possible new uses for materials produced from corn wet\nmilling processes. In the past, several efforts had been made to develop plastics from lactic\nacid, but with limited success. Achieving this technological breakthrough didn’t come easily,\nbut in time the efforts did succeed. A fermentation and distillation process using com was\ndesigned to create a polymer suitable for a broad variety of applications.\nB\nAs an agricultural based firm, Cargill had taken this product as far as it could by 1997. The\ncompany needed a partner with access to plastics markets and polymerization capabilities,\nand began discussions with The Dow Chemical Company. The next step was the formation\nof the joint venture that created Cargill Dow LLC. Cargill Dow’s product is the world’s first\ncommercially available plastic made from annually renewable resources such as com:\n-Nature Works™ PLA is a family of packaging polymers (carbon-based molecules)\nmade from non-petroleum based resources.\n-Ingeo is a family of polymers for fibers made in a similar manner.\nC\nBy applying their unique technology to the processing of natural plant sugars, Cargill Dow\nhas created a more environmentally friendly material that reaches the consumer in clothes,\ncups, packaging and other products. While Cargill Dow is a stand-alone business, it\ncontinues to leverage the agricultural processing, manufacturing and polymer expertise of\nthe two parent companies in order to bring the best possible products to market.\nD\nThe basic raw materials for PLA are carbon dioxide and water. Growing plants, like com,\ntake these building blocks from the atmosphere and the soil. They are combined in the\nplant to make carbohydrates (sucrose and starch) through a process driven by\nphotosynthesis. The process for making Nature Works PLA begins when a renewable\nresource such as corn is milled, separating starch from the raw material. Unrefined\ndextrose, in turn, is processed from the starch.\nE\nCargill Dow turns the unrefined dextrose into lactic acid using a fermentation process\nsimilar to that used by beer and wine producers. This is the same lactic acid that is used as\na food additive and is found in muscle tissue in the human body. Through a special\ncondensation process, a lactide is formed. This lactide is purified through vacuum\ndistillation and becomes a polymer (the base for NatureWorks PLA) that is ready for use\nthrough a solvent-free melt process. Development of this new technology allows the\ncompany to “harvest” the carbon that living plants remove from the air through\nphotosynthesis. Carbon is stored in plant starches, which can be broken down into natural\nplant sugars. The carbon and other elements in these natural sugars are then used to\n \n1\n\nmake NatureWorks PLA.\nF\nNature Works PLA fits all disposal systems and is fully compostable in commercial\ncomposting facilities. With the proper infrastructure, products made from this polymer can\nbe recycled back to a monomer and re-used as a polymer. Thus, at the end of its life cycle,\na product made from Nature Works PLA can be broken down into its simplest parts so that\nno sign of it remains.\nG\nPLA is now actively competing with traditional materials in packaging and fiber applications\nthroughout the world; based on the technology’s success and promise, Cargill Dow is\nquickly becoming a premier player in the polymers market. This new polymer now\ncompetes head-on with petroleum-based materials like polyester. A wide range of products\nthat vary in molecular weight and crystallinity can be produced, and the blend of physical\nproperties of PLA makes it suited for a broad range of fiber and packaging applications.\nFiber and non-woven applications include clothing, fiberfill, blankets and wipes. Packaging\napplications include packaging films and food and beverage containers.\nH\nAs Nature Works PLA polymers are more oil- and grease-resistant and provide a better\nflavor and aroma barrier than existing petroleum-based polymers, grocery retailers are\nincreasingly using this packaging for their fresh foods. As companies begin to explore this\nfamily of polymers, more potential applications are being identified. For example, PLA\npossess two properties that are particularly useful for drape fabrics and window furnishings.\nTheir resistance to ultraviolet light is particularly appealing as this reduces the amount of\nfading in such fabrics, and their refractive index is low, which means fabrics constructed\nfrom these polymers can be made with deep colors without requiring large amounts of dye.\nIn addition, sportswear makers have been drawn to the product as it has an inherent ability\nto take moisture away from the skin and when blended with cotton and wool, the result is\ngarments that are lighter and better at absorbing moisture.\nI\nPLA combines inexpensive large-scale fermentation with chemical processing to produce a\nvalue-added polymer product that improves the environment as well. The source material\nfor PLA is a natural sugar found in plants such as com and using such renewable feedstock\npresents several environmental benefits. As an alternative to traditional petroleum-based\npolymers, the production of PLA uses 20%-50% less fossil fuel and releases a lower\namount of greenhouse gasses than comparable petroleum-based plastic; carbon dioxide in\nthe atmosphere is removed when the feedstock is grown and is returned to the earth when\nthe polymer is degraded. Because the company is using raw materials that can be\nregenerated year after year, it is both cost-competitive and environmentally responsible.\n \n2",
