Now, however, there is a choice, and a rapidly increasing number\nof households worldwide are choosing the solar energy option. Solar energy, the\nconversion of sunlight into energy, is made possible through the use of ‘photovoltaics’,\nwhich are simple appliances that fit onto the roof of a house.\nB\nThe photovoltaics-powered home remains connected to the power lines, but no storage is\nrequired on-site, only a box of electronics (the inverter) to the interface between the\nphotovoltaics and the grid network. Figure 1 illustrates the system. During the day, when\nthe home may not be using much electricity, excess power from the solar array is fed back\nto the grid, to factories and offices that need daytime power. At night, power flows the\nopposite way. The grid network effectively provides storage. If the demand for electricity is\nwell matched to when the sun shines, solar energy is especially valuable. This occurs in\nplaces like California in the US and Japan, where air-conditioning loads for offices and\nfactories are large but heating loads for homes are small.\nC\nThe first systematic exploration of the use of photovoltaics on homes began in the US\nduring the 1970s. A well-conceived program started with the sitting of a number of\nresidential experiment stations’ at selected locations around the country, representing\ndifferent climatic zones. These stations contained a number of ‘dummy’ houses, each with\ndifferent solar-energy system design. Homes within the communities close to these stations\nwere monitored to see how well their energy use matched the energy generated by the\nstations’ dummy roofs. A change in US government priorities in the early 1980s halted this\nprogram.\nD\nWith the US effort dropping away, the Japanese Sunshine Project came to the fore. A large\nresidential test station was installed on Rokko Island beginning in 1986. This installation\nconsists of 18 ‘dummy’ homes. Each equipped with its own 2-5 kilowatt photovoltaic\nsystem (about 20 – 50 square meters for each system). Some of these simulated homes\nhave their own electrical appliances inside, such as TV sets, refrigerators and air\nconditioning units, which switch on and off under computer control providing a lavish\nlifestyle for the non-existent occupants. For the other systems, electronics simulate these\nhousehold loads. This test station has allowed being explored in a systematic way, under\nwell-controlled test conditions. With no insurmountable problems identified, the Japanese\nhave used the experience gained from this station to begin their own massive residential\nphotovoltaics campaign.\n \n1\n\nE\nMeanwhile, Germany began a very important ‘1,000 roof program’ in 1990, aimed at\ninstalling photovoltaics on the roofs of 1,000 private homes. Large federal and regional\ngovernment subsidies were involved, accounting in most cases for 70% of the total system\ncosts. The program proved immensely popular, forcing its extension to over 2,000 homes\nscattered across Germany. The success of this program stimulated other European\ncountries to launch a similar program.\nF\nJapan’s ‘one million roof program’ was prompted by the experience gained in the Rokko\nIsland test site and the success of the German 1,000 roof program. The initially quoted\naims of the Japanese New Energy Development Organization were to have 70,000 homes\nequipped with the photovoltaics by the year 2000, on the way to 1 million by 2010. The\nprogram made a modest start in 1994 when 539 systems were installed with a government\nsubsidy of 50 percent. Under this program, entire new suburban developments are using\nphotovoltaics.\nG\nThis is good news, not only for the photovoltaic industry but for everyone concerned with\nthe environment. The use of fossil fuels to generate electricity is not only costly in financial\nterms, but also in terms of environmental damage. Gases produced by the burning of fossil\nfuels in the production of electricity are a major contributor to the greenhouse effect. To\ndeal with this problem, many governments are now proposing stringent targets on the\namount of greenhouse gas emissions permitted. These targets mean that all sources of\ngreenhouse gas emissions including residential electricity use will receive closer attention\nin the future.\nH\nIt is likely that in the future, governments will develop building codes that attempt to\nconstrain the energy demands of new housing. For example, the use of photovoltaics or\nthe equivalent may be stipulated to lessen demands on the grid network and hence reduce\nfossil fuel emissions. Approvals for building renovations may also be conditional upon\ntaking such energy-saving measures. If this were to happen, everyone would benefit.\nAlthough there is an initial cost in attaching the system to the rooftop, the householder’s\noutlay is soon compensated with the savings on energy bills. In addition, everyone living on\nthe planet stands to gain from the more benign environmental impact.\n \n2",
