  "passage_text": "Reading Practice\n \nFlight from reality\nMobiles are barred, but passengers can lap away on their laptops to their hearts’ content.\nIs one really safer than the other? In the US, a Congressional subcommittee grilled airline\nrepresentatives and regulators about the issue last month. But the committee heard that\nusing cellphones in planes may indeed pose a risk albeit a slight one. This would seem to\nvindicate the treatment of Manchester oil worker Neil Whitehouse, who was sentenced last\nsummer to a year in jail by a British court for refusing to turn off his mobile phone on a flight\nhome from Madrid. Although he was only typing a message to be sent on landing not\nactually making a call, the court decided that hems putting the flight at risk.\nA\nThe potential for problems is certainly there. Modern airliners are packed with electronic\ndevices that control the plane and handle navigation and communications. Each has to\nmeet stringent safeguards to make sure it doesn’t emit radiation that would interfere with\nother devices in the plane-standards that passengers’ personal electronic devices don’t\nnecessarily meet. Emissions from inside the plane could also interfere with sensitive\nantennae on the fixed exterior.\nB\nBut despite running a number of studies, Boeing, Airbus and various government agencies\nhaven’t been able to find clear evidence of problems caused by personal electronic\ndevices, including mobile phones. “We’ve done our own studies. We’ve found cellphones\nactually have no impact on the navigation system,” says Maryanne Greczyn, a\nspokeswoman for Airbus Industries of North America in Herndon, Virginia, Not do they\naffect other critical systems, she says The only impact Airbus found? “Sometimes when a\npassenger is starting or finishing a phone call, the pilot hears a wry slight beep in the\nheadset,” she says.\nC\nThe best evidence yet of a problem comes from a report released this year by Britain’s Civil\nAviation Authority. Its researchers generated simulated cellphone transmissions inside two\nBoeing aircraft. They concluded that the transmissions could create signals at a power and\nfrequency that would not affect the latest equipment, but exceeded the safety threshold\nestablished in 1984 and might, therefore, affect some of the older equipment on board.\nThis doesn’t mean “mission critical” equipment such as the navigation system and flight\ncontrols. But the devices that could be affected, such as smoke detectors and fuel level\nindicators, could still create serious problems for the flight crew if they malfunction.\n \nD\nMany planes still use equipment certified to the older standards, says Dan Hawkes, head of\navionics at the CAA’s Safely Regulation Croup. The CAA study doesn’t prove the\nequipment will actually fail when subjected to the signals but does show there’s a danger.\n“We’ve taken some of the uncertainty out of these beliefs,” he says Another study later this\nyear will see if the cellphone signals actually cause devices to fail.\nE\n \n1\n\nIn 1996, RTCA, a consultant hired by the Federal Aviation Administration in the US to\nconduct tests, determined that potential problems from personal electronic devices were\n“low”. Nevertheless, it recommended a ban on their use during “critical” periods of flight,\nsuch as take-off and landing. RTCA didn’t actually test cellphones, but nevertheless\nrecommended their wholesale ban on flights, But if “better safe than sorry” is the current\npolicy, it’s applied inconsistently, according to Marshall Cross, the chairman of Mega Wave\nCorporation, based in Boylston, Massachusetts. Why are cellphones outlawed when no\none considers a ban on laptops? “It’s like most things in life. The reason is a little bit\ntechnical, a little bit economic and a little bit political,” says Cross.\nF\nThe company wrote a report for the FAA in 1998 saying it is possible to build an on-board\nsystem that can detect dangerous signals from electronic devices. But Cross’s personal\nconclusion is that mobile phones aren’t the real threat. “You’d have to stretch things pretty\nfar to figure out how a cellphone could interfere with a plane’s systems,” he says.\nCellphones transmit in ranges of around 400, 800 or 1800 megahertz. Since no important\npiece of aircraft equipment operates at those frequencies, the possibility of interference is\nvery low, Cross says. The use of Computers and electronic game systems is much more\nworrying, lie says. They can generate very strong signals at frequencies that could interfere\nwith plane electronics, especially if a mouse is attached {the wire operates as an antenna\nor if their built-in shielding is somehow damaged. Some airlines are even planning to put\nsockets for laptops in seatbacks.\nG\nThere’s fairly convincing anecdotal evidence that some personal electronic devices have\ninterfered with systems. Aircrew on one flight found that the autopilot was being\ndisconnected, and narrowed the problem down to a passenger’s portable computer. They\ncould actually watch the autopilot disconnect when they switched the computer on. Boeing\nbought the computer, took it to the airline’s labs and even tested it on an empty flight. But\nas with every other reported instance of interference, technicians were unable to replicate\nthe problem.\nH\nSome engineers, however, such as Bruce Donham of Boeing, say that common sense\nsuggests phones are more risky than laptops. “A device capable of producing a strong\nemission is not as safe as a device which does not have any intentional emission,” lie says.\nNevertheless, many experts think it’s illogical that cellphones are prohibited when\ncomputers aren’t. Besides, the problem is more complicated than simply looking at power\nand frequency. In the air, the plane operates in a soup of electronic emissions, created by\nits own electronics and by ground-based radiation. Electronic devices in the cabin-\nespecially those emitting a strong signal-can behave unpredictably, reinforcing other\nsignals, for instance, or creating unforeseen harmonics that disrupt systems.\nI\nDespite the Congressional subcommittee hearings last month, no one seems to be working\nseriously on a technical solution that would allow passengers to use their phones. That’s\nmostly because no one -besides cellphone users themselves-stands to gain a lot if the\nphones are allowed in the air. Even the cellphone companies don’t want it. They are\n \n2\n\nconcerned that airborne signals could cause problems by flooding a number of the\nnetworks’ base stations at once with the same signal This effect, called bigfooting, happens\nbecause airborne cellphone signals tend to go to many base stations at once, unlike land\ncalls which usually go to just one or two stations. In the US, even if FAA regulations didn’t\nprohibit cellphones in the air, Federal Communications Commission regulations would.\nJ\nPossible solutions might be to enhance airliners’ electronic insulation or to fit detectors\nwhich warned flight staff when passenger devices were emitting dangerous signals. But\nCross complains that neither the FAA, the airlines nor the manufacturers are showing much\ninterest in developing these. So despite Congressional suspicions and the occasional\nirritated (or jailed) mobile user, the industry’s “better safe than sorry” policy on mobile\nphones seems likely to continue. In the absence of firm evidence that the international\nairline industry is engaged in a vast conspiracy to overcharge its customers, a delayed\nphone call seems a small price to pay for even the tiniest reduction in the chances of a\nPlane Crash. But you’ll still be allowed to use your personal computer during a flight. And\nwhile that remains the case, airlines can hardly claim that logic has prevailed.\n \n3",
