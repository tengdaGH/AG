As the nearest country\nof South Polar Region, New Zealand has maintained an upward trend in its average\ntemperature in the past few years. However, the temperature in New Zealand will go up\n4oC in the next century while the polar region will go up more than 6oC. The different\npictures of temperature stem from its surrounding ocean which acts like the air conditioner.\nThus New Zealand is comparatively fortunate.\nScientifically speaking, this temperature phenomenon in New Zealand originated from what\nresearchers call “SAM” (Southern Annular Mode), which refers to the wind belt that circles\nthe Southern Oceans including New Zealand and Antarctica. Yet recent work has revealed\nthat changes in SAM in New Zealand have resulted in a weakening of moisture during the\nsummer, and more rainfall in other seasons. A bigger problem may turn out to be heavier\ndroughts for agricultural activities because of more water loss from soil, resulting in poorer\nharvest before winter when the rainfall arrive too late to rescue.\nAmong all the calamities posed be drought, moisture deficit ranks the first. Moisture deficit\nis the gap between the water plants need during the growing season and the water the\nearth can offer. Measures of moisture deficit were at their highest since the 1970s in New\nZealand. Meanwhile, ecological analyses clearly show moisture deficit is imposed at\ndifferent growth stage of crops. If moisture deficit occurs around a crucial growth stage, it\nwill cause about 22% reduction in grain yield as opposed to moisture deficit at vegetative\nphase.\nGlobal warming is not only affecting agriculture production. When scientists say the\ncountry’s snow pack and glaciers are melting at an alarming rate due to global warming,\nthe climate is putting another strain on the local places. For example, when the\ndevelopment of global warming is accompanied by the falling snow line, the local skiing\nindustry comes into a crisis. The snow line may move up as the temperature goes up, and\nthen the snow at the bottom will melt earlier. Fortunately, it is going to be favorable for the\nlocal skiing industry to tide over tough periods since the quantities of snowfall in some\nareas are more likely to increase.\nWhat is the reaction of glacier region? The climate change can be reflected in the glacier\nregion in southern New Zealand or land covered by ice and snow. The reaction of a glacier\nto a climatic change involves a complex chain of processes. Over time periods of years to\nseveral decades, cumulative changes in mass balance cause volume and thickness\nchanges, which will affect the flow of ice via altered internal deformation and basal sliding.\nThis dynamic reaction finally leads to glacier length changes, the advance or retreat of\nglacier tongues. Undoubtedly, glacier mass balance is a more direct signal of annual\natmospheric conditions.\nThe latest research result of National Institute of Water and Atmospheric (NIWA) Research\nshows that glaciers line keeps moving up because of the impacts of global warming.\nFurther losses of ice can be reflected in Mt. Cook Region. By 1996, a 14 km long sector of\nthe glacier had melted down forming a melt lake (Hooker Lake) with a volume. Melting of\nthe glacier front at a rate of 40 m/yr will cause the glacier to retreat at a rather uniform rate.\nTherefore, the lake will continue to grow until it reaches the glacier bed.\n \n1\n\nA direct result of the melting glaciers is the change of high tides the serves the main factor\nfor sea level rise. The trend of sea level rise will bring a threat to the groundwater system\nfor its hyper-saline groundwater and then pose a possibility to decrease the agricultural\nproduction. Many experts believe that the best way to counter this trend is to give a longer-\nterm view of sea level change in New Zealand. Indeed, the coastal boundaries need to be\nupgraded and redefined.\nThere is no doubt that global warming has affected New Zealand in many aspects. The\nemphasis on the global warming should be based on the joints efforts of local people and\nexperts who conquer the tough period. For instance, farmers are taking a long term, multi-\ngenerational approach to adjust the breeds and species according to the temperature.\nAgriculturists also find ways to tackle the problems that may bring to the soil. In broad\nterms, going forward, the systemic resilience that’s been going on a long time in the\necosystem will continue.\nHow about animals’ reaction? Experts have surprisingly realized that animals have\nunconventional adaptation to global warming. A study has looked at sea turtles on a few\nnorthern beaches in New Zealand and it is very interesting to find that sea turtles can\nbecome male or female according to the temperature. Further researches will try to find out\nhow rising temperatures would affect the ratio of sex reversal in their growth. Clearly, the\ntemperature of the nest plays a vital role in the sexes of the baby turtles.\nTackling the problems of global warming is never easy in New Zealand, because records\nshow the slow process of global warming may have a different impact on various regions.\nFor New Zealand, the emission of carbon dioxide only accounts for 0.5% of the world’s\ntotal, which has met the governmental standard.\nHowever, New Zealand’s effort counts only a tip of the iceberg. So far, global warming has\nbeen a world issue that still hangs in an ambiguous future.\n \n2",
