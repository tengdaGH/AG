  "passage_text": "Reading Practice\n \nThe Truth about the Environment\nFor many environmentalists, the world seems to be getting worse. They have developed a\nhit-list of our main fears: that natural resources are running out; that the population is ever\ngrowing, leaving less and less to eat; that species are becoming extinct in vast numbers,\nand that the planet's air and water are becoming ever more polluted.\nBut a quick look at the facts shows a different picture. First, energy and other natural\nresources have become more abundant, not less so, since the book The Limits to Growth'\nwas published in 1972 by a group of scientists. Second, more food is now produced per\nhead of the world's population than at any time in history. Fewer people are starving. Third,\nalthough species are .indeed becoming extinct, only about 0.7% of them are expected to\ndisappear in the next 50 years, not 25-50%, as has so often been predicted. And finally,\nmost forms of environmental pollution either appear to have been exaggerated, or are\ntransient - associated with the early phases of industrialisation and therefore best cured not\nby restricting economic growth, but by accelerating it. One form of pollution - the release of\ngreenhouse gases that causes global warming - does appear to be a phenomenon that is\ngoing to extend well into our future, but its total impact is unlikely to pose a devastating\nproblem. A bigger problem may well turn out to be an inappropriate response to it.\nYet opinion polls suggest that many people nurture the belief that environmental standards\nare declining and four factors seem to cause this disjunction between perception and\nreality.\nOne is the lopsidedness built into scientific research. Scientific funding goes mainly to\nareas with many problems. That may be wise policy, but it will also create an impression\nthat many more potential problems exist than is the case.\nSecondly, environmental groups need to be noticed by the mass media. They also need to\nkeep the money rolling in. Understandably, perhaps, they sometimes overstate their\narguments. In 1997, for example, the World Wide Fund for Nature issued a press release\nentitled: 'Two thirds of the world's forests lost forever'. The truth turns out to be nearer 20%.\nThough these groups are run overwhelmingly by selfless folk, they nevertheless share\nmany of the characteristics of other lobby groups. That would matter less if people applied\nthe same degree of scepticism to environmental lobbying as they do to lobby groups In\nother fields. A trade organisation arguing for, say, weaker pollution controls is instantly\nseen as self-interested. Yet a green organisation opposing such a weakening is seen as\naltruistic, even if an impartial view of the controls in question might suggest they are doing\nmore harm than good.\nA third source of confusion is the attitude of the media. People are clearly more curious\nabout bad news than good. Newspapers and broadcasters are there to provide what the\npublic wants. That, however, can lead to significant distortions of perception. An example\nwas America's encounter with El Nino in 1997 and 1998. This climatic phenomenon was\naccused of wrecking tourism, causing allergies, melting the ski-slopes and causing 22\ndeaths. However, according to an article in the Bulletin of the American Meteorological\nSociety, the damage it did was estimated at US$4 billion but the benefits amounted to\nsome US$19 billion. These came from higher winter temperatures (which saved an\nestimated 850 lives, reduced heating costs and diminished spring floods caused by\n \n1\n\nmeltwaters).\nThe fourth factor is poor individual perception. People worry that the endless rise in the\namount of stuff everyone throws away will cause the world to run out of places to dispose\nof waste. Yet, even if America's trash output continues to rise as it has done in the past,\nand even if the American population doubles by 2100, all the rubbish America produces\nthrough the entire 21st century will still take up only one-12.000th of the area of the entire\nUnited States.\nSo what of global warming? As we know, carbon dioxide emissions are causing the planet\nto warm. The best estimates are that the temperatures will rise by 2-3°C in this century,\ncausing considerable problems, at a total cost of US$5,000 billion.\nDespite the intuition that something drastic needs to be done about such a costly problem,\neconomic analyses clearly show it will be far more expensive to cut carbon dioxide\nemissions radically than to pay the costs of adaptation to the increased temperatures. A\nmodel by one of the main authors of the United Nations Climate Change Panel shows how\nan expected temperature increase of 2.1 degrees in 2100 would only be diminished to an\nincrease of 1.9 degrees. Or to put ft another way, the temperature increase that the planet\nwould have experienced in 2094 would be postponed to 2100.\nSo this does not prevent global warming, but merely buys the world six years. Yet the cost\nof reducing carbon dioxide emissions, for the United States alone, will be higher than the\ncost of solving the world's single, most pressing health problem: providing universal access\nto clean drinking water and sanitation. Such measures would avoid 2 million deaths every\nyear, and prevent half a billion people from becoming seriously ill.\nIt is crucial that we look at the facts if we want to make the best possible decisions for the\nfuture. It may be costly to be overly optimistic - but more costly still to be too pessimistic. \n \n2",
