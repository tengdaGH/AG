  "passage_text": "Reading Practice\n \nMeasuring Organisational Performance\nThere is clear-cut evidence that, for a period of at least one year, supervision which\nincreases the direct pressure for productivity can achieve significant increases in\nproduction. However, such short-term increases are obtained only at a substantial and\nserious cost to the organisation.\nTo what extent can a manager make an impressive earnings record over a short period of\none to three years by exploiting the company’s investment in the human organisation in his\nplant or division? To what extent will the quality of his organisation suffer if he does so?\nThe following is a description of an important study conducted by the Institute for Social\nResearch designed to answer these questions.\nThe study covered 500 clerical employees in four parallel divisions. Each division was\norganised in exactly the same way, used the same technology, did exactly the same kind of\nwork, and had employees of comparable aptitudes.\nProductivity in all four of the divisions depended on the number of clerks involved. The\nwork entailed the processing of accounts and generating of invoices. Although the volume\nof work was considerable, the nature of the business was such that it could only be\nprocessed as it came along. Consequently, the only way in which productivity could be\nincreased was to change the size of the workgroup.\nThe four divisions were assigned to two experimental programmes on a random basis.\nEach programme was assigned at random a division that had been historically high in\nproductivity and a division that had been below average in productivity. No attempt was\nmade to place a division in the programme that would best fit its habitual methods of\nsupervision used by the manager, assistant managers, supervisors and assistant\nsupervisors.\nThe experiment at the clerical level lasted for one year. Beforehand, several months were\ndevoted to planning, and there was also a training period of approximately six months.\nProductivity was measured continuously and computed weekly throughout the year. The\nattitudes of employees and supervisory staff towards their work were measured just before\nand after the period.\nTurning now to the heart of the study, in two divisions an attempt was made to change the\nsupervision so that the decision levels were pushed down and detailed supervision of the\nworkers reduced. More general supervision of the clerks and their supervisors was\nintroduced. In addition, the managers, assistant managers, supervisors and assistant\nsupervisors of these two divisions were trained in group methods of leadership, which they\nendeavoured to use as much as their skill would permit during the experimental year. For\neasy reference, the experimental changes in these two divisions will be labelled the\n‘participative programme!\nIn the other two divisions, by contrast, the programme called for modifying the supervision\nso as to increase the closeness of supervision and move the decision levels upwards. This\nwill be labelled the ‘hierarchically controlled programme’. These changes were\naccomplished by a further extension of the scientific management approach. For example,\none of the major changes made was to have the jobs timed and to have standard times\n \n1\n\ncomputed. This showed that these divisions were overstaffed by about 30%. The general\nmanager then ordered the managers of these two divisions to cut staff by 25%. This was\ndone by transfers without replacing the persons who left; no one was to be dismissed.\nResults of the Experiment\nChanges in Productivity \nFigure 1 shows the changes in salary costs per unit of work, which reflect the change in\nproductivity that occurred in the divisions. As will be observed, the hierarchically controlled\nprogrammes increased productivity by about 25%. This was a result of the direct orders\nfrom the general manager to reduce staff by that amount. Direct pressure produced a\nsubstantial increase in production.\nA significant increase in productivity of 2O% was also achieved in the participative\nprogramme, but this was not as great an increase as in the hierarchically controlled\nprogramme. To bring about this improvement, the clerks themselves participated in the\ndecision to reduce the size of the work group. (They were aware of course that productivity\nincreases were sought by management in conducting these experiments.) Obviously,\ndeciding to reduce the size of a work group by eliminating some of its members is probably\none of the most difficult decisions for a work group to make. Yet the clerks made it. In fact,\none division in the participative programme increased its productivity by about the same\namount as each of the two divisions in the hierarchically controlled programme. The other\nparticipative division, which historically had been the poorest of all the divisions, did not do\nso well and increased productivity by only 15%.\nChanges in Attitudes\nAlthough both programmes had similar effects on productivity, they had significantly\ndifferent results in other respects. The productivity increases in the hierarchically controlled\nprogramme were accompanied by shifts in an adverse direction in such factors as loyalty,\nattitudes, interest, and involvement in the work. But just the opposite was true in the\nparticipative programme.\nFor example, Figure 2 shows that when more general supervision and increased\nparticipation were provided, the employees’ feeling of responsibility to see that the work got\ndone increased. Again, when the supervisor was away, they kept on working. In the\nhierarchically controlled programme, however, the feeling of responsibility decreased, and\nwhen the supervisor was absent, work tended to stop.\n \nAs Figure 3 shows, the employees in the participative programme at the end of the year felt\nthat their manager and assistant manager were ‘closer to them’ than at the beginning of the\nyear. The opposite was true in the hierarchical programme. Moreover, as Figure 4 shows,\nemployees in the participative programme felt that their supervisors were more likely to\n‘pull’ for them, or for the company and them, and not be solely interested in the company,\nwhile in the hierarchically controlled programme, the opposite trend occurred.\n \n2",
