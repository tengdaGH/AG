  "passage_text": "Reading Practice\n \nThe Mozart Effect\nA\nMusic has been used for centuries to heal the body. In the Ebers Papyrus (one of the\nearliest medical documents, circa 1550 BC), it was recorded that physicians chanted to\nheal the sick (Castleman, 1994). In various cultures, we have observed singing as part of\nhealing rituals. In the world of Western medicine, however, using music in medicine lost\npopularity until the introduction of the radio. Researchers then started to notice that\nlistening to music could have significant physical effects. Therapists noticed music could\nhelp calm anxiety, and researchers saw that listening to music, could cause a drop in blood\npressure. In addition to these two areas, music has been used with cancer chemotherapy\nto reduce nausea, during surgery to reduce stress hormone production, during childbirth,\nand in stroke recovery (Castleman, 1994 and Westley, 1998). It has been shown to\ndecrease pain as well as enhance the effectiveness of the immune system. In Japan,\ncompilations of music are used as medication of sorts. For example, if you want to cure a\nheadache or migraine, the album suggested is Mendelssohn’s \"Spring Song”, Dvorak's\n“Humoresque”, or part of George Gershwin’s \"An American in Paris” (Campbell, 1998).\nMusic is also being used to assist in learning, in a phenomenon called the Mozart Effect.\nB\nFrances H. Rauscher, PhD, first demonstrated the correlation between music and learning\nin an experiment in 1993. His experiment indicated that a 10-minute dose of Mozart could\ntemporarily boost intelligence. Groups of students were given intelligence tests after\nlistening to silence, relaxation tapes, or Mozart’s \"Sonata for Two Pianos in D Major” for a\nshort time. He found that after silence, the average IQ score was 110, and after the\nrelaxation tapes, the score rose a point. After listening to Mozart’s music, however, the\nscore jumped to 119 (Westley, 1998). Even students who did not like the music still had an\nincreased score in the IQ test. Rauscher hypothesised that “listening to complex, non-\nrepetitive music, like Mozart's, may stimulate neural pathways that are important in\nthinking” (Castleman, 1994).\nC\nThe same experiment was repeated on rats by Rauscher and Hong Hua Li from Stanford.\nRats also demonstrated enhancement in their intelligence performance. These new studies\nindicate that rats that were exposed to Mozart’s showed “increased gene expression of\nBDNF (a neural growth factor), CREB (a learning and memory compound), and Synapsin I\n(a synaptic growth protein) ” in the brain’s hippocampus, compared with rats in the control\ngroup, which heard only white noise (e.g. the whooshing sound of a V radio tuned between\nstations).\nD\nHow exactly does the Mozart Effect work? Researchers are still trying to determine the\nactual mechanisms for the formation of these enhanced learning pathways. Neuroscientists\nsuspect that music can actually help build and strengthen connections between neurons in\nthe cerebral cortex in a process similar to what occurs in brain development despite its\ntype.\n \n1\n\nWhen a baby is born, certain connections have already been made - like connections for\nheartbeat and breathing. As new information is learned and motor skills develop, new\nneural connections are formed. Neurons that are not used will eventually die while those\nused repeatedly will form strong connections. Although a large number of these neural\nconnections require experience, they must also occur within a certain time frame. For\nexample, a child born with cataracts cannot develop connections within the visual cortex. If\nthe cataracts are removed by surgery right away, the child’s vision develops normally.\nHowever, after the age of 2, if the cataracts are removed, the child will remain blind\nbecause those pathways cannot establish themselves.\nE\nMusic seems to work in the same way. In October of 1997, researchers at the University of\nKonstanz in Germany found that music actually rewires neural circuits (Begley, 1996).\nAlthough some of these circuits are formed for physical skills needed to play an instrument,\njust listening to music strengthens connections used in higher-order thinking. Listening to\nmusic can then be thought of as “exercise” for the brain, improving concentration and\nenhancing intuition. \nF\nIf you’re a little sceptical about the claims made by supporters of the Mozart Effect, you’re\nnot alone. Many people accredit the advanced learning of some children who take music\nlessons to other personality traits, such as motivation and persistence, which are required\nin all types of learning. There have also been claims of that influencing the results of some\nexperiments.\nG\nFurthermore, many people are critical of the role the media had in turning an isolated study\ninto a trend for parents and music educators. After the Mozart Effect was published to the\npublic, the sales of Mozart CDs stayed on the top of the hit list for three weeks. In an article\nby Michael Linton, he wrote that the research that began this phenomenon (the study by\nresearchers at the University of California, Irvine) showed only a temporary boost in IQ,\nwhich was not significant enough to even last throughout the course of the experiment.\nUsing music to influence intelligence was used in Confucian civilisation and Plato alluded to\nPythagorean music when he de- jj scribed its ideal state in The Republic. In both of these\nexamples, music did not cause any overwhelming changes, and the theory eventually died\nout. Linton also asks, “If Mozart’s music were able to improve health, why was Mozart\nhimself so frequently sick? If listening to Mozart’s music increases intelligence and\nencourages spirituality, why aren’t the world’s smartest and most spiritual people Mozart\nspecialists?” Linton raises an interesting point, if the Mozart Effect causes such significant\nchanges, why isn’t there more documented evidence?\nH\nThe “trendiness’’ of the Mozart Effect may have died out somewhat, but there are still\nstrong supporters (and opponents) of the claims made in 1993. Since that initial\nexperiment, there has not been a surge of supporting evidence. However, many parents,\nafter playing classical music while pregnant or when their children are young, will swear by\nthe Mozart Effect.\n \n2\n\nA classmate of mine once told me that listening to classical music while studying will help\nwith memorisation. If we approach this controversy from a scientific aspect, although there\nhas been some evidence that music does increase brain activity, actual improvements in\nlearning and memory have not been adequately demonstrated.\n \n3",
