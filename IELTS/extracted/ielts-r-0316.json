  "passage_text": "Reading Practice\n \nNew Zealand Seaweed\nCall us not weeds; we are flowers of the sea.\nSection A \nSeaweed is a particularly nutritious food, which absorbs and concentrates traces of a wide\nvariety of minerals necessary to the body's health. Many elements may occur in seaweed -\naluminium, barium, calcium, chlorine, copper, iodine and iron, to name but a few - traces\nnormally produced by erosion and carried to the seaweed beds by river and sea currents.\nSeaweeds are also rich in vitamins: indeed, Eskimos obtain a high proportion of their bodily\nrequirements of vitamin C from the seaweeds they eat. \nThe nutritive value of seaweed has long been recognised. For instance, there is a\nremarkably low incidence of goitre amongst the Japanese, and for that matter, amongst our\nown Maori people, who have always eaten seaweeds, and this may well be attributed to\nthe high iodine content of this food. Research into old Maori eating customs shows that\njellies were made using seaweeds, fresh fruit and nuts, fuchsia and tutu berries, cape\ngooseberries, and many other fruits which either grew here naturally or were sown from\nseeds brought by settlers and explorers.\nSection B\nNew Zealand lays claim to approximately 700 species of seaweed, some of which have no\nrepresentation outside this country. Of several species grown worldwide, New Zealand also\nhas a particularly large share. For example, it is estimated that New Zealand has some 30\nspecies of Gigartina, a close relative of carrageen or Irish moss. These are often referred to\nas the New Zealand carrageens. The gel-forming substance called agar which can be\nextracted from this species gives them great commercial application in seameal, from\nwhich seameal custard is made, and in cough mixture, confectionery, cosmetics, the\ncanning, paint and leather industries, the manufacture of duplicating pads, and in\ntoothpaste. In fact, during World War II, New Zealand Gigartina were sent to Australia to be\nused in toothpaste.\nSection C\nYet although New Zealand has so much of the commercially profitable red seaweeds,\nseveral of which are a source of agar (Pterocladia, Gelidium, Chondrus, Gigartina), before\n1940 relatively little use was made of them. New Zealand used to import the Northern\nHemisphere Irish moss (Chondrus crispus) from England and ready-made agar from\nJapan. Although distribution of the Gigartina is confined to certain areas according to\nspecies, it is only on the east coast of the North Island that its occurrence is rare. And even\nthen, the east coast, and the area around Hokiangna, have a considerable supply of the\ntwo species of Pterocladia from which agar is also available. Happily, New Zealand-made\nagar is now obtainable in health food shops.\nSection D\nSeaweeds are divided into three classes determined by colour - red, brown and green -\n \n1\n\nand each tends to live in a specific location. However, except for the unmistakable sea\nlettuce (Ulva), few are totally one colour; and especially when dry, some species can\nchange colour quite significantly - a brown one may turn quite black, or a red one appear\nblack, brown, pink or purple.\nIdentification is nevertheless facilitated by the fact that the factors which determine where a\nseaweed will grow are quite precise, and they therefore tend to occur in very well-defined\nzones. Although there are exceptions, the green seaweeds are mainly shallow-water algae;\nthe browns belong to medium depths, and the reds are plants of the deeper water. Flat\nrock surfaces near mid-level tides are the most usual habitat of sea bombs, Venus’\nnecklace and most brown seaweeds. This is also the location of the purple laver or Maori\nkarengo, which looks rather like a reddish-purple lettuce. Deep-water rocks on open\ncoasts, exposed only at very low tide, are usually the site of bull kelp, strap weeds and\nsimilar tough specimens. Those species able to resist long periods of exposure to the sun\nand air are usually found on the upper shore, while those less able to stand such exposure\noccur nearer to or below the low-water mark. Radiation from the sun, the temperature level,\nand the length of time immersed all play a part in the zoning of seaweeds.\nSection E\nPropagation of seaweeds occurs by spores, or by fertilisation of egg cells. None have roots\nin the usual sense; few have leaves, and none have flowers, fruits or seeds. The plants\nabsorb their nourishment through their fronds when they are surrounded by water: the base\nor \"holdfast\" of seaweeds is purely an attaching organ, not an absorbing one.\nSection F\nSome of the large seaweeds maintain buoyancy with air-filled floats; others, such as bull\nkelp, have large cells filled with air. Some, which spend a good part of their time exposed to\nthe air, often reduce dehydration either by having swollen stems that contain water, or they\nmay (like Venus' necklace) have | swollen nodules, or they may have distinctive shape like\na sea bomb. Others, like the sea cactus, are filled with slimy fluid or have coating of\nmucilage on % the surface. In some of the larger kelps, this coating is not only to keep the\nplant moist but also to protect it from the violent action of waves.\n \n2",
