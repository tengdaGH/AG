Why?\nMillions and millions of these plants grow in rivers and lakes. Sometimes the plants\nbecome so thick that people can walk on them. People cannot travel in boats on the water,\nand they cannot fish in it. The plants stop the water from moving. Then the water carries\ndiseases.\nFarmers cannot use the water on their land.\nNow scientists think that water hyacinths can be useful. The plants are really a tree crop.\nNo one has to take care of them. They just grow and grow and grow. What can farmers use\nthem for?\nSome fish like to eat them. Farmers can grow these fish in the lakes and rivers. Workers\ncan collect and cut the plants with machines. Then they can make fertilizer to make their\ncrops grow better. They can also make feed for their farm animals. Maybe it will be\npossible to make methane gas for energy. (We burn gas from petroleum for energy.\nMethane gas comes from plants.)\nThen poor tropical countries will not have to buy so much expensive petroleum.
