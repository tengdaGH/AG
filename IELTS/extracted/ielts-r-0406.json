  "passage_text": "Reading Practice\n \nSponging dolphins\n(A) In 1984, researchers spotted dolphins doing something unusual in Shark Bay, Western\nAustralia. When the animals got hungry, they ripped a marine basket sponge from the sea\nfloor and fitted it over their beaks like a person would fit a glove over a hand. The scientists\nsuspected that as the dolphins foraged for fish, the sponges protected their beaks, or\nrostra, from the rocks and broken chunks of coral that litter the sea floor, making this\nbehavior the first example of tool use in this species.\n(B) The researchers surmised that a long time ago one ingenious Shark Bay dolphin\nfigured out that by prodding the sediments with a sponge attached to her beak, she\ncould stir up these swim bladder-less fish without being hurt. Eventually, such technique\nbecame popular among other dolphins. But why do dolphins go to all of this trouble when\nthey could simply snag a fish from the open sea? The answer is that the bottom-dwelling\nfish are a lot more nutritious. Some species also don't have swim bladders, gas chambers\nthat help other fish control their buoyancy as they travel up and down the water column. In\nthe Bahamas, where dolphins are also known to forage for bottom-dwelling fish, dolphins\nhunt partly by echolocating these bladders, which give off a strong acoustic signal. That\nhelps the cetaceans find prey even when it's buried in sea sand. But bottom-dwelling fish,\nsuch as barred sandperch, which are favored by some Shark Bay dolphins, don't have\nswim bladders and so are harder to find with echolocation. The sea floor is not nearly as\nsoft here as it is in the Bahamas, so if dolphins want to probe for these fish, they risk\ninjuring their rostra.\n(C) Not every dolphin in Shark Bay hunts with sponges. \"It's primarily done by females,\"\nsays Janet Mann, a behavioral ecologist. She believes the female dolphins invented the\nmethod because of the \"selective pressures they face while raising a calf as long as they\ndo,\" about 4 to 5 years. \"These clever dolphins have figured out a way to target fish that\nother dolphins cannot,\" she says, adding that even the local fishermen do not catch, or\neven know about, this particular species. Mann's previous research has shown that dolphin\nmothers pass the sponging method to their daughters and some of their sons, rare\nevidence of a cultural tradition in an animal other than humans. The team has documented\nthree generations of sponging dolphins.\n(D) The foraging technique came to light a few decades ago - very recently in evolutionary\nterms - when a local fisherman spotted what looked like a strange tumour on a dolphin’s\nnose. Researchers eventually worked out that the ‘tumour’ was a conically shaped sponge\nand it became apparent that the dolphins would spend considerable time searching for one\nthe right shape to fit their nose. The sponge is used to scatter the sand gently on the sea\nfloor and disturb buried fish. When a fish is spotted, the dolphin drops the sponge and\ngives chase. \"It has been thought that behaviours which are exclusively learnt from one\nparent are not very stable. With our model we could now show that sponging can be a\nstable behaviour,\" said Dr Anna Kopps, a biologist at the University of New South Wales.\n(E) By modelling the emergence of \"sponger\" dolphins in a computer simulation, the team\n \n1\n\nof researchers could see different scenarios in which the skill could have spread among the\ndolphin population over the years. They then compared the results of these simulations\nwith field data on the genetic relationship between the spongers, to estimate the role of\nmothers teaching their offspring in transmitting the skill. They found that if the likelihood of\na sponger's offspring learning the ability was less than certain, the dolphins that did pick up\nthe technique needed to gain a survival advantage from the skill, in order for the ability to\npass on to the next generation. The model also allowed them to attempt to calculate the\ndate that the behaviour was likely to have originated.\"The results suggested that sponging\nwas innovated at least 120 to 180 years ago - it is only a best estimate,\" said Dr Kopps.\nScientists discovered that although dolphins tried to teach the hunting technique to all their\nyoung, it was mainly female offspring that grasped the concept. Why male offspring rarely\nacquire the same skill remains unclear, though the team put forward one possible\nexplanation: male bottlenose dolphins tend to form close bonds with other males, and such\nalliances aren't suited to seabed foraging, since it is a time-consuming, solitary activity.\n(F) The US scientists say discovering a new tool is a direct sign of intelligence. “There’s a\nstrong link between animals with larger brains and tool users. Bottlenose dolphins have a\nbrain second in size only to humans.” said Janet Mann, a marine biologist who led the\nresearch. “Dolphins are already good at catching fish so they don’t need tools, but they’ve\ndiscovered this sponge makes their job easier. Working out how to use tools in a creative\nway like that is a hallmark of intelligence.” Mann admits we still do not understand dolphins\nwell. “It’s hard to get inside their heads because their brains are constructed differently and\nit’s very hard to analyse their language, but they do seem very intelligent,” she said.\n(G) Dolphins are also often seen engaging in playful behaviour and creating tools to use for\nentertainment. They have been observed to blow bubbles which they form into rings to play\nwith. After creating the bubble ring, a dolphin will use its nose and body to maintain the\nshape of the bubble and keep it from floating to the surface. The study provides a \"better\nunderstanding of the why and how of sponging\" by the Shark Bay dolphins, says Louis\nHerman, a cognitive psychologist. The work \"adds to previously documented\" examples of\n\"innovation by this highly intelligent species.\" Patterson's and Mann's results also \"reinforce\na pattern\" often seen in other tool-using animals, says Simon Reader, a behavioral\nbiologist. \"Tool use appears to be almost a last option, taken when other options fail or are\nunavailable,\" he says, noting that woodpecker finches in the Galápagos Islands \"turn to tool\nuse only in arid areas,\" wielding cactus spines to extract grubs from tree branches. Using\ntools takes time and energy, Reader says, and animals tend to rely on them only when\nthere's a guaranteed payoff, such as turning up a fatty fish that most other dolphins (and\nfishermen) know nothing about.\n \n2",
