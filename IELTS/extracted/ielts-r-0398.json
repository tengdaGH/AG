  "passage_text": "Reading Practice\n \nSome Facts and Theories about Flu\nThe flu, more properly known as influenza, takes its name from the fact that it is so easily\ntransmitted from person to person (influenza is the Italian word for ’influence’). Usually,\ncontamination occurs through direct contact with secretions from an infected person. Its\nspread is also possible from contaminated airborne particles, such as those that occur\nwhen someone coughs or sneezes. However, it should be made clear that the risk is not\ngreat from simply being in the same room as an infected person, since the flu virus, unlike\nother respiratory viruses, does not dissolve in the air. Within 4-6 hours of someone\ncatching the flu, the virus multiplies in infected cells and the cells burst, spreading the virus\nto other cells nearby.\nThe spread continues for up to 72 hours, the exact length of time depending on the body’s\nimmune system response and the strength of the particular strain of flu. The range of\nhuman responses to the flu virus has been of interest to scientists for many years. This is\nbecause the effect can vary from no infection to a rapid and deadly spread of the virus to\nmany people. One area of study that has received particular attention is the immune\nsystem response of the individual. Where a person’s immune system is healthy, the virus is\nattacked as it enters the body, usually in the respiratory tract. This lessens the severity of\nthe illness. In contrast, people with compromised immune systems (typical in the young,\nwhere it is not fully developed, or in the old and the sick, where it is not working efficiently),\noften suffer the worst effects.\nOne of the body’s responses to flu is the creation of antibodies which recognise and\ndestroy that particular strain of flu virus. What fascinates most researchers in the field is\nthat the human body seems capable of storing these antibodies over a whole lifetime in\ncase of future attack from the same or similar strains of flu. It was while researching these\nantibodies that scientists turned their attention back to what was possibly the worst ever flu\npandemic in the world. The actual number of deaths is disputed, but the outbreak in 1918\nkilled between 20 and 50 million people. It is also estimated that one fifth of the population\nof the world may have been infected.\nThrough tests done on some of the survivors of the 1918 outbreak, it was discovered that,\n90 years later, they still possessed the antibodies to that strain of flu, and some of them\nwere actually still producing the antibodies. Work is now focused on why these people\nsurvived in the first place, with one theory being that they had actually been exposed to an\nearlier, similar strain, therefore developing immunity to the 1918 strain. It is hoped that, in\nthe near future, we might be able to isolate the antibodies and use them to vaccinate\npeople against further outbreaks.\nYet vaccination against the flu is an imprecise measure. At best, the vaccine protects us\nfrom the variations of flu that doctors expect that year. If their predictions are wrong in any\nparticular year, being vaccinated will not prevent us from becoming infected. This is further\ncomplicated by the fact that there are two main types of flu, known as influenza A and\ninfluenza B. Influenza B causes less concern as its effects are usually less serious.\nInfluenza A, however, has the power to change its genetic make-up. Although these\ngenetic changes are rare, they create entirely new strains of flu against which we have no\nprotection. It has been suggested that this is what had happened immediately prior to the\n1918 outbreak, with research indicating that a genetic shift had taken place in China.\n \n1\n\nIn 2005, another genetic shift in an influenza A virus was recorded, giving rise to the H5N1\nstrain, otherwise known as avian flu, or bird flu. Typical of such new strains, we have no\nway of fighting it and many people who are infected with it die. Perhaps more worrying is\nthat it is a strain only previously found in birds but which changed its genetic make-up in a\nway that allowed it to be transmitted to humans. Most of the fear surrounding this virus is\nthat it will change again, developing the ability to pass from human to human. If that\nchange does happen, scientists and doctors can reasonably expect a death rate\ncomparable to that which occurred in 1918 and, given that we can now travel more quickly\nand more easily between countries, infecting many more people than was previously\npossible, it could be several times worse.\n \n2",
