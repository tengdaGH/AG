  "passage_text": "Reading Practice\n \nNew ways of teaching history\n{A} In technology and the media-driven world, it’s becoming increasingly difficult to get our\nstudents’ attention and keep them absorbed in classroom discussions. This generation, in\nparticular, has brought a unique set of challenges to the educational table. Whereas youth\nare easily enraptured by high-definition television, computers, Pods, video games, and cell\nphones, they are less than enthralled by what to them are obsolete textbooks and boring\nclassroom lectures. The question of how to teach history in a digital age is often\ncontentious. On the one side, the old guard thinks the professional standards history is in\nmortal danger from flash-in-the-pan challenges by the digital that is all show and no\nsubstance. On the other side, the self-styled “disruptors” offer overblown rhetoric about\nhow digital technology has changed everything while the moribund profession obstructs all\nprogress in the name of outdated ideals. At least, that’s a parody (maybe not much of one)\nof how the debate proceeds. Both supporters and opponents of the digital share more\ndisciplinary common ground than either admits.\n{B} When provided with merely a textbook as a supplemental learning tool, test results\nhave revealed that most students fail to pinpoint the significance of historical events and\nindividuals. Fewer still are able to cite and substantiate primary historical sources. What\ndoes this say about the way our educators are presenting information? The quotation\ncomes from a report of a 1917 test of 668 Texas students. Less than 10 per cent of school-\nage children attended high school in 1917; today, enrollments are nearly universal. The\nwhole world has turned on its head during the last century but one thing has stayed the\nsame: Young people remain woefully ignorant about history reflected from their history\ntests. Guess what? Historians are ignorant too, especially when we equate historical\nknowledge with the “Jeopardy” Daily Double. In a test, those specializing in American\nhistory did just fine. But those with specialities in medieval, European and African history\nfailed miserably when confronted by items about Fort Ticonderoga, the Olive Branch\nPetition, or the Quebec Act–all taken from a typical textbook. According to the testers, the\nresults from the recent National Assessment in History, like scores from earlier tests, show\nthat young people are “abysmally ignorant” of their own history. Invoking the tragedy of last\nSeptember, historian Diane Ravitch hitched her worries about our future to the idea that our\nnation’s strength is endangered by youth who do poorly on such tests. But if she were\ncorrect, we would have gone down the tubes in 1917!\n{C} There is a huge difference between saying “Kids don’t know the history we want them\nto know” and saying “Kids don’t know history at all.” Historical knowledge burrows itself into\nour cultural pores even if young people can’t marshal it when faced with a multiple-choice\ntest. If we weren’t such hypocrites (or maybe if we were better historians) we’d have to\nadmit that today’s students follow in our own footsteps. For too long we’ve fantasized that\nby rewriting textbooks we could change how history is learned. The problem, however, is\nnot the content of textbooks but the very idea of them. No human mind could retain the\ninformation crammed into these books in 1917, and it can do no better now. If we have\nlearned anything from history that can be applied to every time period, it is that the only\nconstant changes. The teaching of history, or any subject for that matter, is no exception.\nThe question is no longer whether to bring new technologies into everyday education; now,\nthe question is which technologies are most suitable for the range of topics covered in\njunior high and high school history classrooms. Fortunately, technology has provided us\nwith opportunities to present our Civil War lesson plans or our American Revolution lesson\n \n1\n\nplans in a variety of new ways.\n{D} Teachers can easily target and engage the learners of this generation by effectively\ncombining the study of history with innovative multimedia. PowerPoint and presentations, in\nparticular, can expand the scope of traditional classroom discussion by helping teachers to\nexplain abstract concepts while accommodating students’ unique learning styles.\nPowerPoint study units that have been pre-made for history classrooms include all manner\nof photos, prints, maps, audio clips, video clips and primary sources which help to make\nlearning interactive and stimulating. Presenting lessons in these enticing formats helps\ntechnology-driven students retain the historical information they’ll need to know for\nstandard exams.\n \n{E} Whether you’re covering Revolutionary War lesson plans or World War II lesson plans,\nPowerPoint study units are available in formats to suit the needs of your classroom.\nMultimedia teaching instruments like PowerPoint software are getting positive results the\nworld over, framing conventional lectures with captivating written, auditory and visual\ncontent that helps students recall names, dates and causal relationships within a historical\ncontext.\n{F} History continues to show us that new times bring new realities. Education is no\nexception to the rule. The question is not whether to bring technology into the educational\nenvironment. Rather, the question is which technologies are suitable for U.S. and world\nhistory subjects, from Civil War lesson plans to World War II lesson plans. Whether you’re\ncovering your American Revolution lesson plans or your Cold War lesson plans,\nPowerPoint presentations are available in pre-packaged formats to suit your classroom’s\nneeds.\n{G} Meanwhile, some academic historians hold a different view on the use of technology in\nteaching history. One reason they hold is that not all facts can be recorded by film or videos\nand literature is relatively feasible in this case. Another challenge they have to be faced\nwith is the painful process of learning a new technology like the making of PowerPoint and\nthe editing of audio and video clips which is also reasonable especially to some elderly\nhistorians.\n \n2",
