  "passage_text": "Reading Practice\n \nHow does the biological clock tick?\nA\nOur life span is restricted. Everyone accepts this as ‘biologically’ obvious. ‘Nothing lives for\never!’ However, in this statement we think of artificially produced, technical objects,\nproducts which are subjected to natural wear and tear during use. This leads to the result\nthat at some time or other the object stops working and is unusable (‘death’ in the biological\nsense). But are the wear and tear and loss of function of technical objects and the death of\nliving organisms really similar or comparable?\nB\nOur ‘dead’ products are ‘static’, closed systems. It is always the basic material which\nconstitutes the object and which, in the natural course of things, is worn down and\nbecomes ‘older’. Ageing in this case must occur according to the laws of physical chemistry\nand of thermodynamics. Although the same law holds for a living organism, the result of\nthis law is not inexorable in the same way. At least as long as a biological system has the\nability to renew itself it could actually become older without ageing; an organism is an open,\ndynamic system through which new material continuously flows. Destruction of old\nmaterial and formation of new material are thus in permanent dynamic equilibrium. The\nmaterial of which the organism is formed changes continuously. Thus our bodies\ncontinuously exchange old substance for new, just like a spring which more or less\nmaintains its form and movement, but in which the water molecules are always different.\nC\nThus ageing and death should not be seen as inevitable, particularly as the organism\npossesses many mechanisms for repair. It is not, in principle, necessary for a biological\nsystem to age and die. Nevertheless, a restricted life span, ageing, and then death are\nbasic characteristics of life. The reason for this is easy to recognise: in nature, the existent\norganisms either adapt or are regularly replaced by new types. Because of changes in the\ngenetic material (mutations) these have new characteristics and in the course of their\nindividual lives they are tested for optimal or better adaptation to the\nenvironmental conditions. Immortality would disturb this system - it needs room for new\nand better life. This is the basic problem of evolution.\nD\nEvery organism has a life span which is highly characteristic. There are striking differences\nin life span between different species, but within one species the parameter is relatively\nconstant. For example, the average duration of human life has hardly changed in\nthousands of years. Although more and more people attain an advanced age as a result of\ndevelopments in medical care and better nutrition, the characteristic upper limit for most\nremains 80 years. A further argument against the simple wear and tear theory is the\nobservation that the time within which organisms age lies between a few days (even a few\nhours for unicellular organisms) and several thousand years, as with mammoth trees.\nE\nIf a life span is a genetically determined biological characteristic, it is logically necessary to\n \n1\n\npropose the existence of an internal clock, which in some way measures and controls the\nageing process and which finally determines death as the last step in a fixed programme.\nLike the life span, the metabolic rate has for different organisms a fixed mathematical\nrelationship to the body mass. In comparison to the life span this relationship is ‘inverted’:\nthe larger the organism the lower its metabolic rate. Again this relationship is valid not only\nfor birds, but also, similarly on average within the systematic unit, for all other\norganisms (plants, animals, unicellular organisms).\nF\nAnimals which behave ‘frugally’ with energy become particularly old, for example,\ncrocodiles and tortoises. Parrots and birds of prey are often held chained up. Thus they are\nnot able to ‘experience life’ and so they attain a high life span in captivity. Animals which\nsave energy by hibernation or lethargy (e.g. bats or hedgehogs) live much longer than\nthose which are always active. The metabolic rate of mice can be reduced by a very low\nconsumption of food (hunger diet). They then may live twice as long as their well fed\ncomrades. Women become distinctly (about 10 per cent) older than men. If you\nexamine the metabolic rates of the two sexes you establish that the higher male metabolic\nrate roughly accounts for the lower male life span. That means that they live life\n‘energetically’ - more intensively, but not for as long.\nG\nIt follows from the above that sparing use of energy reserves should tend to extend life.\nExtreme high performance sports may lead to optimal cardiovascular performance, but\nthey quite certainly do not prolong life. Relaxation lowers metabolic rate, as does adequate\nsleep and in general an equable and balanced personality. Each of us can develop his or\nher own ‘energy saving programme’ with a little self-observation, critical self-control\nand, above all, logical consistency. Experience will show that to live in this way not only\nincreases the life span but is also very healthy. This final aspect should not be forgotten.\n \n2",
