  "passage_text": "Reading Practice\n \nLeaf-Cutting Ants and Fungus\nThe ants and their agriculture have been extensively studied over the years, but the recent\nresearch has uncovered intriguing new findings about the fungus they cultivate, how they\ndomesticated it and how they cultivate it and preserve it from pathogens. For example, the\nfungus farms, which the ants were thought to keep free of pathogens, turn out to be\nvulnerable to a devastating mold, found nowhere else but in ants’ nests. To keep the mold\nin check, the ants long ago made a discovery that would do credit to any pharmaceutical\nlaboratory.\nLeaf-cutting ants and their fungus farms are a marvel of nature and perhaps the best\nknown example of symbiosis, the mutual dependence of two species. The ants’\nachievement is remarkable -he biologist Edward O. Wilson has called it “one of the major\nbreakthroughs in animal evolution” -because it allows them to eat, courtesy of their\nmushroom’s digestive powers, the otherwise poisoned harvest of tropical forests whose\nleaves are laden with terpenoids, alkaloids and other chemicals designed to sicken\nbrowsers\nFungus growing seems to have originated only once in evolution, because all gardening\nants belong to a single tribe, the descendants of the first fungus farmer. There are more\nthan 200 known species of the attine ant tribe, divided into 12 groups, or genera. The leaf-\ncutters use fresh vegetation; the other groups, known as the lower attines because their\nnests are smaller and their techniques more primitive, feed their gardens with detritus like\ndead leaves, insects and feces. In 1994 a team of four biologists, Ulrich G. Mueller and Ted\nR. Schultz from Cornell University and Ignacio H. Chapela and Stephen A. Rehner from the\nUnited States Department of Agriculture, nanlyzed the DNA of ant funguses. The common\nassumption that the funguses are all derived from a single strain, they found, was only half\ntrue.\nThe leaf-cutters’ fungus was indeed descended from a single strain, propagated clonally, or\njust by budding, for at least 23 million years. But the lower attine ants used different\nvarieties of the fungus, and in one case a quite separate species, the four biologists\ndiscovered. Cameron R. Currie, a Ph.D. student in the University of Toronto, it seemed to\nMr. Currie, resembled the monocultures of various human crops, that are very productive\nfor a while and then succumb to some disastrous pathogen, such as the Irish potato blight.\nMonocultures, which lack the genetic diversity to respond to changing environmental\nthreats, are sitting ducks for parasites. Mr. Currie felt there had to be a parasite in the ant-\nfungus system. But a century of ant research offered no support for the idea. Textbooks\ndescribe how leaf-cutter ants scrupulously weed their gardens of all foreign organisms.\n“People kept telling me, ‘You know the ants keep their gardens free of parasites, don’t\nyou?’ “ Mr. Currie said of his efforts to find a hidden interloper.\nBut after three years of sifting through attine ant gardens, Mr. Currie discovered they are\nfar from free of infections. In last month’s issue of the Proceedings of the National\nAcademy of Sciences, he and two colleagues, Dr. Mueller and David Mairoch, isolated\nseveral alien organisms, particularly a family of parasitic molds called Escovopsis.\nEscovopsis turns out to be a highly virulent pathogen that can devastate a fungus garden in\na couple of days. It blooms like a white cloud, with the garden dimly visible underneath. In a\nday or two the whole garden is enveloped. “Other ants won’t go near it and the ants\n \n1\n\nassociated with the garden just starve to death,” Dr. Rehner said. “They just seem to give\nup, except for those that have rescued their larvae.”\nEvidently the ants usually manage to keep Escovopsis and other parasites under control.\nBut with any lapse in control, or if the ants are removed, Escovopsis will quickly burst forth.\nAlthough new leaf-cutter gardens start off free of Escovopsis, within two years some 60\npercent become infected. The discovery of Escovopsis’s role brings a new level of\nunderstanding to the evolution of the attine ants. “In the last decade, evolutionary biologists\nhave been increasingly aware of the role of parasites as driving forces in evolution,” Dr.\nSchultz said. There is now a possible reason to explain why the lower attine species keep\nchanging the variety of fungus in their mushroom gardens, and occasionally domesticating\nnew ones— to stay one step ahead of the relentless Escovopsis.\nInterestingly, Mr. Currie found that the leaf-cutters had in general fewer alien molds in their\ngardens than the lower attines, yet they had more Escovopsis infections. It seems that the\nprice they pay for cultivating a pure variety of fungus is a higher risk from Escovopsis. But\nthe leaf-cutters may have little alternative: they cultivate a special variety of fungus which,\nunlike those grown by the lower attines, produces nutritious swollen tips for the ants to eat.\nDiscovery of a third partner in the ant-fungus symbiosis raises the question of how the\nattine ants, especially the leaf-cutters, keep this dangerous interloper under control.\nAmazingly enough, Mr. Currie has again provided the answer. “People have known for a\nhundred years that ants have a whitish growth on the cuticle,” said Dr. Mueller, referring to\nthe insects’ body surface. “People would say this is like a cuticular wax. But Cameron was\nthe first one in a hundred years to put these things under a microscope. He saw it was not\ninert wax. It is alive.” Mr. Currie discovered a specialized patch on the ants’ cuticle that\nharbors a particular kind of bacterium, one well known to the pharmaceutical industry,\nbecause it is the source of half the antibiotics used in medicine. From each of 22 species of\nattine ant studied, Mr. Cameron and colleagues isolated a species of Streptomyces\nbacterium, they reported in Nature in April. The Streptomyces does not have much effect\non ordinary laboratory funguses. But it is a potent poisoner of Escovopsis, inhibiting its\ngrowth and suppressing spore formation. Because both the leaf-cutters and the lower\nattines use Streptomyces, the bacterium may have been part of their symbiosis for almost\nas long as theEscovopsis mold. If so, some Alexander Fleming of an ant discovered\nantibiotics millions of years before people did. Even now, the ants are accomplishing two\nfeats beyond the powers of human technology. The leaf-cutters are growing a monocultural\ncrop year after year without disaster, and they are using an antibiotic apparently so wisely\nand prudently that, unlike people, they are not provoking antibiotic resistance in the target\npathogen.\n \n2",
