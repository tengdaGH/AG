  "passage_text": "Reading Practice\n \nThe Lost City\nAn explorer’s encounter with the ruined city of Machu Picchu, the most famous icon\nof the Inca civilisation\nA\nWhen the US explorer and academic Hiram Bingham arrived in South America in 1911, he\nwas ready for what was to be the greatest achievement of his life: the exploration of the\nremote hinterland to the west of Cusco, the old capital of the Inca empire in the Andes\nmountains of Peru. His goal was to locate the remains of a city called Vitcos, the last\ncapital of the Inca civilisation.\nCusco lies on a high plateau at an elevation of more than 3,000 metres, and Bingham’s\nplan was to descend from this plateau along the valley of the Urubamba river, which takes\na circuitous route down to the Amazon and passes through an area of dramatic canyons\nand mountain ranges.\nB\nWhen Bingham and his team set off down the Urubamba in late July, they had an\nadvantage over travellers who had preceded them: a track had recently been blasted down\nthe valley canyon to enable rubber to be brought up by mules from the jungle. Almost all\nprevious travellers had left the river at Ollantaytambo and taken a high pass across the\nmountains to rejoin the river lower down, thereby cutting a substantial corner, but also\ntherefore never passing through the area around Machu Picchu.\nC\nOn 24 July they were a few days into their descent of the valley. The day began slowly,\nwith Bingham trying to arrange sufficient mules for the next stage of the trek. His\ncompanions showed no interest in accompanying him up the nearby hill to see some ruins\nthat a local farmer, Melchor Arteaga, had told them about the night before. The morning\nwas dull and damp, and Bingham also seems to have been less than keen on the prospect\nof climbing the hill. In his book Lost City of the Incas, he relates that he made the ascent\nwithout having the least expectation that he would find anything at the top.\nD\nBingham writes about the approach in vivid style in his book. First, as he climbs up the hill,\nhe describes the ever-present possibility of deadly snakes, ‘capable of making\nconsiderable springs when in pursuit of their prey’; not that he sees any. Then there’s a\nsense of mounting discovery as he comes across great sweeps of terraces, then a\nmausoleum, followed by monumental staircases and, finally, the grand ceremonial\nbuildings of Machu Picchu. 'It seemed like an unbelievable dream the sight held me\nspellbound ’, he wrote.\nE\nWe should remember, however, that Lost City of the Incas is a work of hindsight, not\nwritten until 1948, many years after his journey. His journal entries of the time reveal a\nmuch more gradual appreciation of his achievement. He spent the afternoon at the ruins\nnoting down the dimensions of some of the buildings, then descended and rejoined his\ncompanions, to whom he seems to have said little about his discovery. At this stage,\nBingham didn’t realise the extent or the importance of the site, nor did he realise what use\n \n1\n\nhe could make of the discovery.\nF\nHowever, soon after returning it occurred to him that he could make a name for himself\nfrom this discovery. When he came to write the National Geographic magazine article that\nbroke the story to the world in April 1913, he knew he had to produce a big idea.\nHe wondered whether it could have been the birthplace of the very first Inca, Manco the\nGreat, and whether it could also have been what chroniclers described as ‘the last city of\nthe Incas’. This term refers to Vilcabamba the settlement where the Incas had fled from\nSpanish invaders in the 1530s. Bingham made desperate attempts to prove this belief for\nnearly 40 years. Sadly, his vision of the site as both the beginning and end of the Inca\ncivilisation, while a magnificent one, is inaccurate. We now know, that Vilcabamba actually\nlies 65 kilometres away in the depths of the jungle.\nG\nOne question that has perplexed visitors, historians and archaeologists alike ever since\nBingham, is why the site seems to have been abandoned before the Spanish Conquest.\nThere are no references to it by any of the Spanish chroniclers - and if they had known of\nits existence so close to Cusco they would certainly have come in search of gold.\nAn idea which has gained wide acceptance over the past few years is that Machu Picchu\nwas a moya, a country estate built by an Inca emperor to escape the cold winters of Cusco,\nwhere the elite could enjoy monumental architecture and spectacular views. Furthermore,\nthe particular architecture of Machu Picchu suggests that it was constructed at the time of\nthe greatest of all the Incas, the emperor Pachacuti (1438-71). By custom, Pachacuti’s\ndescendants built other similar estates for their own use, and so Machu Picchu would have\nbeen abandoned after his death, some 50 years before the Spanish Conquest.\n \n2",
