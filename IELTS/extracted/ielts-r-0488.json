  "passage_text": "Reading Practice\n \nThe History of Early Cinema\nThe history of the cinema in its first thirty years is one of major and, to this day,\nunparalleled expansion and growth. Beginning as something unusual in a handful of big\ncities - New York, London, Paris and Berlin - the new medium quickly found its way across\nthe world, attracting larger and larger audiences wherever it was shown and replacing other\nforms of entertainment as it did so. As audiences grew, so did the places where films were\nshown, finishing up with the ‘great picture palaces’ of the 1920s, which rivalled, and\noccasionally superseded, theatres and opera-houses in terms of opulence and splendour.\nMeanwhile, films themselves developed from being short ‘attractions’ only a couple of\nminutes long, to the full-length feature that has dominated the world's screens up to the\npresent day.\n \n \n \nAlthough French, German, American and British pioneers have all been credited with the\ninvention of cinema, the British and the Germans played a relatively small role in its\nworldwide exploitation, It was above all the French, followed closely by the Americans, who\nwere the most passionate exporters of the new invention, helping to start cinema in China,\nJapan, Latin America and Russia. In terms of artistic development it was again the French\nand the Americans who took the lead, though in the years before the First World War, Italy,\nDenmark and Russia also played a part.\nIn the end, it was the United States that was to become, and remain, the largest single\nmarket for films. By protecting their own market and pursuing a vigorous export policy, the\nAmericans achieved a dominant position on the world market by the start of the First World\nWar. The centre of film-making had moved westwards, to Hollywood, and it was films from\nthese new Hollywood studios that flooded onto the world's film markets in the years after\nthe First World War, and have done so ever since. Faced with total Hollywood domination,\nfew film industries proved competitive. The Italian industry, which had pioneered the\nfeature film with spectacular films likeQuo vadis? (1913) and Cabiria (1914), almost\ncollapsed. In Scandinavia, the Swedish cinema had a brief period of glory, notably with\npowerful epic films and comedies. Even the French cinema found itself in a difficult\nposition. In Europe, only Germany proved industrially capable, while in the new Soviet\nUnion and in Japan the development of the cinema took place in conditions of commercial\nisolation.\nHollywood took the lead artistically as well as industrially. Hollywood films appealed\nbecause they had better-constructed narratives, their special effects were more impressive,\nand the star system added a new dimension to screen acting. If Hollywood did not have\nenough of its own resources, it had a great deal of money to buy up artists and technical\ninnovations from Europe to ensure its continued dominance over present or future\ncompetition.\nThe zest of the world survived partly by learning from Hollywood and partly because\naudiences continued to exist for a product which corresponded to needs which Hollywood\ncould not supply. As well as popular audiences, there were also increasing audiences for\nfilms which were artistically more adventurous or which dealt with the issues in the outer\nworld.\nNone of this would have happened without technology, and cinema is in fact unique as an\nart form. In the early years, this art farm was quite primitive, similar to the original French\n \n1\n\nidea of using a lantern and slides back in the seventeenth century. Early cinema\nprogrammes were a mixture of items, combining comic sketches, free-standing narratives,\nserial episodes and the occasional trick or animated film. With the arrival of the feature\nlength narrative as the main attraction, other types of films became less important. The\nmaking of cartoons became a separate branch of film-making, generally practised outside\nthe major studios, and the same was true of serials. Together with newsreels, they tended\nto be shown as short items in a programme which led to the feature.\nFrom early cinema, it was only Americana slapstick comedy that successfully developed in\nboth short and feature format. However, during this 'Silent Film' era, animation, comedy,\nserials and dramatic features continued to thrive, along with factual films or documentaries,\nwhich acquired an increasing distinctiveness as the period progressed. It was also at this\ntime that the avant-garde film first achieved commercial success, this time thanks almost\nexclusively to the French and the occasional German film.\nOf the countries which developed and maintained distinctive national cinemas in the silent\nperiod, the most important were France, Germany and the Soviet Union. Of these, the\nFrench displayed the most continuity, in spite of the war and post-war economic\nuncertainties. The German cinema, relatively insignificant in the pre-war years, exploded\non to the world scene after 1919. Yet even they were both overshadowed by the Soviets\nafter the 1917 Revolution. They turned their back on the past, leaving the style of the pre-\nwar Russian cinema to the emigres who fled westwards to escape the Revolution.\nThe other countries whose cinemas changed dramatically are: Britain, which had an\ninteresting but undistinguished history in the silent period; Italy, which had a brief moment\nof international fame just before the war; the Scandinavian countries, particularly Denmark,\nwhich played a role in the development of silent cinema quite out of proportion to their\nsmall population; and Japan, where a cinema developed based primarily on traditional\ntheatrical and, to a lesser extent, other art forms and only gradually adapted to western\ninfluence.\n \n2",
