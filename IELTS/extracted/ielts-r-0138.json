  "passage_text": "Reading Practice\n \nDo literate women make better mothers?\nChildren in developing countries are healthier and more likely to survive past the age of five\nwhen their mothers can read and write. Experts In public health accepted this idea\ndecades ago, but until now no one has been able to show that a woman's ability to read in\nItself Improves her children’s chances of survival.\nMost literate women learnt to read In primary school, and the fact that a woman has had an\neducation may simply indicate her family’s wealth or that It values Its children more\nhighly. Now a long-term study carried out In Nicaragua has eliminated these factors by\nshowing that teaching reading to poor adult women, who would otherwise have remained\nIlliterate, has a direct effect on their children’s health and survival.\nIn 1979, the government of Nicaragua established a number of social programmes,\nincluding a National Literacy Crusade. By 1985, about 300,000 Illiterate adults from all over\nthe country, many of whom had never attended primary school, had learnt how to read,\nwrite and use numbers.\nDuring this period, researchers from the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine, the Central\nAmerican Institute of Health In Nicaragua, the National Autonomous University of\nNicaragua and the Costa Rican Institute of Health Interviewed nearly 3,000 women, some\nof whom had learnt to read as children, some during the literacy crusade and some who\nhad never learnt at all. The women were asked how many children they had given birth to\nand how many of them had died In Infancy. The research teams also examined the\nsurviving children to find out how well-nourished they were.\nThe Investigators' findings were striking. In the late 1970s, the infant mortality rate for the\nchildren of Illiterate mothers was around 110 deaths per thousand live births. At this point\nIn their lives, those mothers who later went on to learn to read had a similar level Of\nchild mortality (105/1000). For women educated in primary school, however, the Infant\nmortality rate was significantly lower, at 80 per thousand.\nIn 1985, after the National Literacy Crusade had ended, the infant mortality figures for\nthose who remained illiterate and for those educated In primary school remained more or\nless unchanged. For those women who learnt to read through the campaign, the infant\nmortality rate was 84 per thousand, an impressive 21 points lower than for those women\nwho were still Illiterate. The children of the newly-literate mothers were also better\nnourished than those of women who could not read.\nWhy are the children of literate mothers better off? According to Peter Sandiford of the\nLiverpool School of Tropical Medicine, no one Knows for certain. Child health was not on\nthe curriculum during the women’s lessons, so fie and his colleagues are looking at\nother factors. They are working with the same group of 3,000 women, to try to find out\nwhether reading mothers make better use of hospitals and clinics, opt for smaller families,\nexert more control at home, learn modern childcare techniques more quickly, or whether\nthey merely have more respect for themselves and their children.\nThe Nicaraguan study may have important implications for governments and aid agencies\nthat need to know where to direct their resources. Sandiford says that there is\nincreasing evidence that female education, at any age, is \"an important health intervention\n \n1\n\nin its own right’. The results of the study lend support to the World Bank's recommendation\nthat education budgets in developing countries should be increased, not just to help\ntheir economies, but also to improve child health.\n'We’ve known for a long time that maternal education is important,’ says John Cleland of\nthe London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine. ‘But we thought that even if we\nstarted educating girls today, we'd have to wait a generation for the pay off. The\nNicaraguan study suggests we may be able to bypass that.'\nCleland warns that the Nicaraguan crusade was special in many ways, and similar\ncampaigns elsewhere might not work as well. It is notoriously difficult to teach adults skills\nthat do not have an immediate impact on their everyday lives, and many literacy campaigns\nin other countries have been much less successful. 'The crusade was part of a larger effort\nto bring a better life to the people,’ says Cleland. Replicating these conditions in other\ncountries will be a major challenge for development workers.\n \n2",
