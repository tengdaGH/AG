  "passage_text": "Reading Practice\n \nFinding our way\nA. “Drive 200 yards, and then turn right,” says the car’s computer voice. You relax in the\ndriver’s seat, follow the directions and reach your destination without error. It’s certainly\nnice to have the Global Positioning System (GPS) to direct you to within a few yards of\nyour goal. Yet if the satellite service’s digital maps become even slightly outdated, you can\nbecome lost. Then you have to rely on the ancient human skill of navigating in three-\ndimensional space. Luckily, your biological finder has an important advantage over GPS: it\ndoes not go awry if only one part of the guidance system goes wrong, because it works in\nvarious ways. You can ask questions of people on the sidewalk. Or follow a street that\nlooks familiar. Or rely on a navigational rubric: “If I keep the East River on my left, I will\neventually cross 34th Street.” The human positioning system is flexible and capable of\nlearning. Anyone who knows the way from point A to point B—and from A to C—can\nprobably figure out how to get from B to c, too.\n \nB. But how does this complex cognitive system really work? Researchers are looking at\nseveral strategies people use to orient themselves in space: guidance, path integration and\nroute following. We may use all three or combinations thereof. And as experts learn more\nabout these navigational skills, they are making the case that our abilities may underlie our\npowers of memory and logical thinking. Grand Central, Please Imagine that you have\narrived in a place you have never visited-New York City. You get off the train at Grand\nCentral Terminal in midtown Manhattan. You have a few hours to explore before you must\nreturn for your ride home. You head uptown to see popular spots you have been told about:\nRockefeller Center, Central Park, the Metropolitan Museum of Art. You meander in and out\nof shops along the way. Suddenly, it is time to get back to the station. But how?\nC. If you ask passersby for help, most likely you will receive information in many different\nforms. A person who orients herself by a prominent landmark would gesture southward:\n“Look down there. See the tall, broad MetLife Building? Head for that “the station is right\nbelow it.” Neurologists call this navigational approach “guidance,” meaning that a landmark\nvisible from a distance serves as the marker for one’s destination.\nD. Another city dweller might say: “What places do you remember passing? … Okay. Go\ntoward the end of Central Park, then walk down to St. Patrick’s Cathedral. A few more\nblocks, and Grand Central will be off to your left.” In this case, you are pointed toward the\nmost recent place you recall, and you aim for it. Once there you head for the next notable\nplace and so on, retracing your path. Your brain is adding together the individual legs of\nyour trek into a cumulative progress report. Researchers call this strategy “path\nintegration.” Many animals rely primarily on path integration to get around, including\ninsects, spiders, crabs and rodents. The desert ants of the genus Cataglyphis employ this\nmethod to return from foraging as far as 100 yards away. They note the general direction\nthey came from and retrace then steps, using the polarization of sunlight to orient\nthemselves even under overcast skies. On their way back they are faithful to this inner\nhoming vector. Even when a scientist picks up an ant and puts it in a totally different spot,\nthe insect stubbornly proceeds in the originally determined direction until it has gone “back”\nall of the distance it wandered from its nest. Only then does the ant realize it has not\nsucceeded, and it begins to walk in successively larger loops to find its way home.\n \n1\n\n \nE. Whether it is trying to get back to the anthill or the train station, any animal using path\nintegration must keep track of its own movements so it knows, while returning, which\nsegments it has already completed. As you move, your brain gathers data from your\nenvironment—sights, sounds, smells, lighting, muscle contractions, a sense of time\npassing—to determine which way your body has gone. The church spire, the sizzling\nsausages on that vendor’s grill, the open courtyard, and the train station—all represent\nsnapshots of memorable junctures during your journey.\n \nF. In addition to guidance and path integration, we use a third method for finding our way.\nAn office worker you approach for help on a Manhattan street comer might say: “Walk\nstraight down Fifth, turn left on 47th, turn right on Park, go through the walkway under the\nHelmsley Building, then cross the street to the MetLife Building into Grand Central.” This\nstrategy, called route following, uses landmarks such as buildings and street names, plus\ndirections-straight, turn, go through—for reaching intermediate points. Route following is\nmore precise than guidance or path integration, but if you forget the details and take a\nwrong turn, the only way to recover is to backtrack until you reach a familiar spot, because\nyou do not know the general direction or have a reference landmark for your goal. The\nroute-following navigation strategy truly challenges the brain. We have to keep all the\nlandmarks and intermediate directions in our head. It is the most detailed and therefore\nmost reliable method, but it can be undone by routine memory lapses. With path\nintegration, our cognitive memory is less burdened; it has to deal with only a few general\ninstructions and the homing vector. Path integration works because it relies most\nfundamentally on our knowledge of our body’s general direction of movement, and we\nalways have access to these inputs. Nevertheless, people often choose to give route-\nfollowing directions, in part because saying “Go straight that way!” just does not work in our\ncomplex, man-made surroundings.\nG. Road Map or Metaphor? On your next visit to Manhattan you will rely on your memory to\nget around. Most likely you will use guidance, path integration and route following in\nvarious combinations. But how exactly do these constructs deliver concrete directions? Do\nwe humans have, as an image of the real world, a kind of road map in our heads—with\nsymbols for cities, train stations and churches; thick lines for highways; narrow lines for\nlocal streets? Neurobiologists and cognitive psychologists do call the portion of our memory\nthat controls navigation a “cognitive map.” The map metaphor is obviously seductive: maps\nare the easiest way to present geographic information for convenient visual inspection. In\nmany cultures, maps were developed before writing, and today they are used in almost\nevery society. It is even possible that maps derive from a universal way in which our\nspatial-memory networks are wired.\nH. Yet the notion of a literal map in our heads may be misleading; a growing body of\nresearch implies that the cognitive map is mostly a metaphor. It may be more like a\nhierarchical structure of relationships. To get back to Grand Central, you first envision the\nlarge scale-that is, you visualize the general direction of the station. Within that system you\nthen imagine the route to the last place you remember. After that, you observe your nearby\nsurroundings to pick out a recognizable storefront or street comer that will send you toward\nthat place. In this hierarchical, or nested, scheme, positions and distances are relative, in\ncontrast with a road map, where the same information is shown in a geometrically precise\nscale.\n \n2",
