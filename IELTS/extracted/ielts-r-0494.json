  "passage_text": "Reading Practice\nThe history of the guitar\nThe word 'guitar' was brought into English as an adaptation of the Spanish word 'guitarra',\nwhich was, in turn, derived from the Greek 'kithara'. Tracing the roots of the word further\nback into linguistic history, it seems to have been a combination of the Indo-European stem\n'guit-', meaning music, and the root ’-tar’, meaning chord or string. The root '-tar' is actually\ncommon to a number of languages, and can also be found in the word ’sitar', also a\nstringed musical instrument. Although the spelling and pronunciation differ between\nlanguages, these key elements have been present in most words for 'guitar' throughout\nhistory.\nWhile the guitar may have gained most of its popularity as a musical instrument during the\nmodern era, guitar-like instruments have been in existence in numerous cultures\nthroughout the world for more than 5,000 years. The earliest instruments that the modern\neye and ear would recognise as a 'normal' acoustic guitar date from about 500 years ago.\nPrior to this time, stringed instruments were in use throughout the world, but these early\ninstruments are known primarily from visual depictions, not from the continued existence of\nmusic written for them. The majority of these depictions show simple stringed instruments,\noften lacking some of the parts that define a modern guitar. A number of these instruments\nhave more in common with the lute than the guitar.\nThere is some uncertainty about the exact date of the earliest six-string guitar. The oldest\none still in existence, which was made by Gaetano Vinaccia, is dated 1779. However, the\nauthenticity of six-string guitars alleged to have been made prior to 1790 is often suspect,\nas many fakes have been discovered dating to this era. The early nineteenth century is\ngenerally accepted as the time period during which six-string guitars began taking on their\nmodern shape and dimensions. Thus for nearly two hundred years, luthiers, or guitar\nmakers, have been producing versions of the modern acoustic guitar.\nThe first electric guitar was not developed until the early twentieth century. George\nBeauchamp received the first patent for an electric guitar in 1936, and Beauchamp went on\nto co-found Rickenbacker, originally known as the Electro String Instrument Company.\nAlthough Rickenbacker began producing electric guitars in the late 1930s, this brand\nreceived most of its fame in the 1960s, when John Lennon used a Rickenbacker guitar for\nthe Beatles' debut performance on the Ed Sullivan show in 1964. George Harrison later\nbought a Rickenbacker guitar of his own, and the company later gave him one of their\nearliest 12-string electric guitars. Paul McCartney also used a Rickenbacker bass guitar for\nrecording. The Beatles continued to use Rickenbacker guitars throughout their career, and\nmade the instruments highly popular among other musicians of the era.\nThe Fender Musical Instruments Company and the Gibson Guitar Corporation were two\nother early electric guitar pioneers, both developing models in the early 1950s. Fender\nbegan with the Telecaster in 1950 and 1951, and the Fender Stratocaster debuted in 1954.\nGibson began selling the Gibson Les Paul, based partially on assistance from jazz\nmusician and guitar innovator Les Paul, in 1952. The majority of present day solid-body\nelectric guitars are still based largely on these three early electric guitar designs.\nThroughout the history of the guitar, an enormous number of individuals have made their\nmark on the way in which the instrument was built, played and perceived. Though some of\nthese individuals are particularly well known, like the Beatles or Les Paul, the majority of\n \n1\n\nthese people are virtually invisible to most modern guitar fans. By looking at the entire\nhistory of the guitar, rather than just recent developments, largely confined to electric\nguitars, it is possible to see more of the contributions of earlier generations.\n \n2",
