  "passage_text": "Reading Practice\n \nSand Dunes\nA\nOne of the main problems posed by sand dunes is their encroachment on human habitats.\nSand dunes move by different means, all of them aided by the wind. Sand dunes threaten\nbuildings and crops in Africa, the Middle East, and China. Preventing sand dunes from\noverwhelming cities and agricultural areas has become a priority for the United Nations\nEnvironment Program. On the other hand, dune habitats provide niches for highly\nspecialized plants and animals, including numerous rare and endangered species.\nB\nSand is usually composed of hard minerals such as quartz that cannot be broken down into\nsilt or clay. Yellow, brown and reddish shades of sand indicate their presence of iron\ncompounds. Red sand is composed of quartz coated by a layer of iron oxide. White sands\nare nearly pure gypsum. Sand with a high percentage of silicate can be used in\nglassmaking. Sandstone is created by sand, mixed with lime, chalk or some other material\nthat acts as a binding agent, that is deposited in layers at the bottom of a sea or other area\nand pressed together into rock by the great pressure of sediments that are deposited on\ntop of it over thousands or millions of years.\nC\nThe most common dune form on Earth and on Mars is crescentic. Crescent-shaped\nmounds are generally wider than they are long. The slipfaces are on the concave sides of\nthe dunes. These dunes form under winds that blow consistently from one direction, and\nthey also are known as barchans or transverse dunes. Some types of crescentic dunes\nmove more quickly over desert surfaces than any other type of dune. A group of dunes\nmoved more than 100 metres per year between 1954 and 1959 the China’s Ningxia\nProvince, and similar speeds have been recorded in the Western Desert of Egypt. The\nlargest crescentic dunes on Earth, with mean crest-to-crest widths of more than 3\nkilometres, are in China’s Taklamakan Desert.\nD\nRadially symmetrical, star dunes are pyramidal sand mounds with slipfaces on there or\nmore arms that radiate from the high center of the mound. They tend to accumulate in\nareas with multidirectional wind regimes. Star dunes grow upward rather than laterally.\nThey dominate the Grand Erg Oriental of the Sahara. In other deserts, they occur around\nthe margins of the sand seas, particularly near topographic barriers. In the southeast\nBadain Jaran Desert of China, the star dunes are up to 500 metres tall and may be the\ntallest dunes on Earth. Straight or slightly sinuous sand ridges typically much longer than\nthey are wide are known as linear dunes. They may be more than 160 kilometres (99 mi)\nlong. Some linear dunes merge to form Y-shaped compound dunes. Many forms in\nbidirectional wind regimes. The long axes of these dunes extend in the resultant direction\nof sand movement. Linear loess hills known as pahas are superficially similar.\nE\nOnce sand begins to pile up, ripples and dunes can form. Wind continues to move sand up\n \n1\n\nto the top of the pile until the pile is so steep that it collapses under its own weight. The\ncollapsing sand comes to rest when it reaches just the right steepness to keep the dune\nstable. This angle, usually about 30-34°, is called the angle of repose. Every pile of loose\nparticles has a unique angle of repose, depending upon the properties of the material it’s\nmade of, such as the grain size and roundness. Ripples grow into dunes with the increase\nof wind and sand input.\nF\nThe repeating cycle of sand inching up the windward side to the dune crest, then slipping\ndown the dune’s slip face allows the dune to inch forward, migrating in the direction the\nwind blows. As you might guess, all of this climbing then slipping leaves its mark on the\ninternal structure of the dune. The image on the right shows fossil sand dune structure\npreserved in the Merced Formation at Fort Funston, Golden Gate National Recreation\nArea. The sloping lines or laminations you see are the preserved slip faces of a migrating\nsand dune. This structure is called cross-bedding and can be the result of either wind or\nwater currents. The larger the cross-bedded structure, however, the more likely it is to be\nformed by wind, rather than water.\nG\nSand dunes can “sing” at a level up to 115 decibels and generate sounds in different notes.\nThe dunes at Sand Mountain n Nevada usually sing in a low C but can also sing in B and C\nsharp. The La Mar de Dunas in Chile hum in F while those at the Ghord Lahmar in\nMorocco howl in G sharp. The sounds are produced by avalanches of sand generated by\nblowing winds. For a while, it was thought that the avalanches caused the entire dune to\nresonate like a flute or violin but if that were true then different size dunes would produce\ndifferent notes. In the mid 2000s, American, French and Moroccan scientists visiting sand\ndunes in Morocco, Chile, China and Oman published a paper in the Physical Review\nLetters that determined the sounds were produced by collisions between grains of sand\nthat caused the motions of the grains to become synchronized, causing the outer layer of a\ndune to vibrate like the cone of a loudspeaker, producing sound. The tone of the sounds\ndepended primarily on the size of the grains.\nH\nScientists performed a computer simulation on patterns and dynamics of desert dunes in\nlaboratory. Dune patterns observed in deserts were reproduced. From the initial random\nstate, stars and linear dunes are produced, depending on the variability of the wind\ndirection. The efficiency in sand transport is calculated through the course of development.\nScientists found that the sand transport is the most efficient in the linear transverse dune.\nThe efficiency in sand transport always increased through the evolution, and the way it\nincreases was stepwise. They also found that the shadow zone, the region where the sand\nwastes the chance to move, shrinks through the course of evolution, which greatly helps\nthem build a model to simulate a sand move.\n \n2",
