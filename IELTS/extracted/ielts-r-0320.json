  "passage_text": "Reading Practice\n \nObtaining Linguistic Data\nA\nMany procedures are available for obtaining data about a language. They range from a\ncarefully planned, intensive field investigation in a foreign country to a casual introspection\nabout one's mother tongue carried out in an armchair at home.\nB\nIn all cases, someone has to act as a source of language data - an informant Informants\nare (ideally) native speakers of a language, who provide utterances for analysis and other\nkinds of information about the language (e.g. translations, comments about correctness, or\njudgements on usage). Often, when studying their mother tongue, linguists act as their own\ninformants, judging the ambiguity, acceptability, or other properties of utterances against\ntheir own intuitions. The convenience of this approach makes it widely used, and it is\nconsidered the norm in the generative approach to linguistics. But a linguist's personal\njudgements are often uncertain, or disagree with the judgements of other linguists, at which\npoint recourse is needed to more objective methods of enquiry, using non-linguists as\ninformants.\nThe latter procedure is unavoidable when working on foreign languages, or child speech.\nC\nMany factors must be considered when selecting informants - whether one is working with\nsingle speakers (a common situation when languages have not been described before),\ntwo people interacting, small groups or large-scale samples. Age, sex, social background\nand other aspects of identity are important, as these factors are known to influence the kind\nof language used. The topic of conversation and the characteristics of the social setting\n(e.g. the level of formality) are also highly relevant, as are the personal qualities of the\ninformants (e.g. their fluency and consistency). For larger studies, scrupulous attention has\nbeen paid to the sampling theory employed, and in all cases, decisions have to be made\nabout the best investigative techniques to use.\nD \nToday, researchers often tape-record informants. This enables the linguist's claims about\nthe language to be checked, and provides a way of making those claims more accurate\n('difficult' pieces of speech can be listened to repeatedly). But obtaining naturalistic, good-\nquality data is never easy. People talk abnormally when they know they are being\nrecorded, and sound quality can be poor. A variety of tape-recording procedures have thus\nbeen devised to minimise the 'observer's paradox' (how to observe the way people behave\nwhen they are not being observed). Some recordings are made without the speakers being\naware of the fact - a procedure that obtains very natural data, though ethical objections\nmust be anticipated. Alternatively, attempts can be made to make the speaker forget about\nthe recording, such as keeping the tape recorder out of sight, or using radio microphones.\nA useful technique G is to introduce a topic that quickly involves the speaker, and\nstimulates a natural language style (e.g. asking older informants about how times have\nchanged in their locality).\n \n1\n\nE\nAn audio tape recording does not solve all the linguist's problems, however. Speech is\noften unclear and ambiguous. Where possible, therefore, the recording has to be\nsupplemented by the observer's written comments on the non-verbal behaviour of the\nparticipants, and about the context in general, A facial expression, for example, can\ndramatically alter the meaning of what is said. Video recordings avoid these problems to a\nlarge extent, but even they have limitations (the camera cannot be everywhere), and\ntranscriptions always benefit from any additional commentary provided by an observer.\nF\nLinguists also make great use of structured sessions, in which they systematically ask their\ninformants for utterances that describe certain actions, objects or behaviours. With a\nbilingual informant, or through use of an interpreter, it is possible to use translation\ntechniques (‘How do you say table in your language?'). A large number of points can be\ncovered in a short time, using interview worksheets and questionnaires. Often, the\nresearcher wishes to obtain information about just a single variable, in which case a\nrestricted set of questions may be used: a particular feature of pronunciation, for example,\ncan be elicited by asking the informant to say a restricted set of words. There are also\nseveral direct methods of elicitation, such as asking informants to fill in the blanks in a\nsubstitution frame (e.g. I_see a car), or feeding them the wrong stimulus for correction ('Is it\npossible to say / no can see?').\nG\nA representative sample of language, compiled for the purpose of linguistic analysis, is\nknown as a corpus. A corpus enables the linguist to make unbiased statements about\nfrequency of usage, and it provides accessible data for the use of different researchers. Its\nrange and size are variable. Some corpora attempt to cover the language as a whole,\ntaking extracts from many kinds of text; others are extremely selective, providing a\ncollection of material that deals only with a particular linguistic feature. The size of the\ncorpus depends on practical factors, such as the time available to collect, process and\nstore the data: it can take up to several hours to provide an accurate transcription of a few\nminutes of speech. Sometimes a small sample of data will be enough to decide a linguistic\nhypothesis; by contrast, corpora in major research projects can total millions of words. An\nimportant principle is that all corpora, whatever their size, are inevitably limited in their\ncoverage, and always need to be supplemented by data derived from the intuitions of\nnative speakers of the language, through either introspection or experimentation.\n \n2",
