A number of techniques developed since the 1950s,\nhowever, have placed the study of these subjects on a sounder and more objective footing.\nThe best information on early population movements is now being obtained from the\n'archaeology of the living body', the clues to be found in genetic material.\nB\nRecent work on the problem of when people first entered the Americas is an example of\nthe value of these new techniques. North-east Asia and Siberia have long been accepted\nas the launching ground for the first human colonisers of the New World’. But was there\none major wave of migration across the Bering Strait into the Americas, or several? And\nwhen did this event, or events, take place? In recent years, new clues have come from\nresearch into genetics, including the distribution of genetic markers in modern\nNative Americans1 2.\nC\nAn important project, led by the biological anthropologist Robert Williams, focused on the\nvariants (called Gm allotypes) of one particular protein -immunoglobin G - found in the\nfluid portion of human blood. All proteins 'drift', or produce variants, over the generations,\nand members of an interbreeding human population will share a set of such variants. Thus,\nby comparing the Gm allotypes of two different populations (e.g. two Indian tribes), one can\nestablish their genetic 'distance', which itself can be calibrated to give an indication of the\nlength of time since these populations last interbred.\nD\nWilliams and his colleagues sampled the blood of over 5,000 American Indians in western\nNorth America during a twenty-year period. They found that their Gm allotypes could be\ndivided into two groups, one of which also corresponded to the genetic typing of Central\nand South American Indians. Other tests showed that the Inuit (or Eskimo) and\nAleut3 formed a third group. From this evidence it was deduced that there had been\nthree major waves of migration across the Bering Strait. The first, Paleo-lndian, wave more\nthan 15,000 years ago was ancestral to all Central and South American Indians. The\nsecond wave, about 14,000-12,000 years ago, brought Na-Dene hunters, ancestors of the\nNavajo and Apache (who only migrated south from Canada about 600 or 700 years ago).\nThe third wave, perhaps 10,000 or 9,000 years ago, saw the migration from North-east\nAsia of groups ancestral to the modern Eskimo and Aleut.\nE\nHow far does other research support these conclusions? Geneticist Douglas Wallace has\nstudied mitochondrial DNA4 in blood samples from three widely separated Native American\ngroups: Pima-Papago Indians in Arizona, Maya Indians on the Yucatán peninsula, Mexico,\nand Ticuna Indians in the Upper Amazon region of Brazil. As would have been predicted by\nRobert Williams's work, all three groups appear to be descended from the same ancestral\n \n1\n\n(Paleo-lndian) population.\n \n \nF\nThere are two other kinds of research that have thrown some light on the origins of the\nNative American population; they involve the study of teeth and of languages. The\nbiological anthropologist Christy Turner is an expert in the analysis of changing physical\ncharacteristics in human teeth. He argues that tooth crowns and roots5 have a high\ngenetic component, minimally affected by environmental and other factors. Studies carried\nout by Turner of many thousands of New and Old World specimens, both ancient and\nmodern, suggest that the majority of prehistoric Americans are linked to Northern Asian\npopulations by crown and root traits such as incisor6 shoveling (a scooping out on one or\nboth surfaces of the tooth), single-rooted upper first premolars6 and triple-rooted lower first\nmolars6.\nAccording to Turner, this ties in with the idea of a single Paleo-lndian migration out of North\nAsia, which he sets at before 14,000 years ago by calibrating rates of dental micro-\nevolution. Tooth analyses also suggest that there were two later migrations of Na-Denes\nand Eskimo-Aleut.\nG\n \nThe linguist Joseph Greenberg has, since the 1950s, argued that all Native American\nlanguages belong to a single 'Amerind' family, except for Na-Dene and Eskimo-Aleut - a\nview that gives credence to the idea of three main migrations. Greenberg is in a minority\namong fellow linguists, most of whom favour the notion of a great many waves of migration\nto account for the more than 1,000 languages spoken at one time by American Indians. But\nthere is no doubt that the new genetic and dental evidence provides strong backing for\nGreenberg's view.
