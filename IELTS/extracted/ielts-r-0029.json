  "passage_text": "Reading Practice\n \nAn Introduction to Film Sound\nThough we might think of film as an essentially visual experience, we really cannot afford to\nunderestimate the importance of film sound. A meaningful sound track is often as\ncomplicated as the image on the screen, and is ultimately just as much the responsibility of\nthe director. The entire sound track consists of three essential ingredients: the\nhuman voice, sound effects and music. These three tracks must be mixed and balanced so\nas to produce the necessary emphases which in turn create desired effects.\nTopics which essentially refer to the three previously mentioned tracks are discussed\nbelow. They include dialogue, synchronous and asynchronous sound effects, and music.\nLet us start with dialogue. As is the case with stage drama, dialogue serves to tell the story\nand expresses feelings and motivations of characters as well. Often with film\ncharacterization the audience perceives little or no difference between the character and\nthe actor. Thus, for example, the actor Humphrey Bogart is the character Sam Spade; film\npersonality and life personality seem to merge. Perhaps this is because the very texture\nof a performer's voice supplies an element of character.\nWhen voice textures fit the performer's physiognomy and gestures, a whole and very\nrealistic persona emerges. The viewer sees not an actor working at his craft, but another\nhuman being struggling with life. It is interesting to note that how dialogue is used and the\nvery amount of dialogue used varies widely among films. For example, in the highly\nsuccessful science-fiction film 2001, little dialogue was evident, and most of it was\nbanal and of little intrinsic interest. In this way the film-maker was able to portray what\nThomas Sobochack and Vivian Sobochack call, in An Introduction to Film, the 'inadequacy\nof human responses when compared with the magnificent technology created by man and\nthe visual beauties of the universe'.\nThe comedy Bringing Up Baby, on the other hand, presents practically non-stop dialogue\ndelivered at breakneck speed. This use of dialogue underscores not only the dizzy quality\nof the character played by Katherine Hepburn, but also the absurdity of the film itself and\nthus its humor. The audience is bounced from gag to gag and conversation to\nconversation; there is no time for audience reflection. The audience is caught up in a\nwhirlwind of activity in simply managing to follow the plot. This film presents pure\nescapism - largely due to its frenetic dialogue.\nSynchronous sound effects are those sounds which are synchronized or matched with\nwhat is viewed. For example, if the film portrays a character playing the piano, the sounds\nof the piano are projected. Synchronous sounds contribute to the realism of film and\nalso help to create a particular atmosphere.\nFor example, the 'click' of a door being opened may simply serve to convince the audience\nthat the image portrayed is real, and the audience may only subconsciously note the\nexpected sound.\nHowever, if the 'click' of an opening door is part of an ominous action such as a burglary,\nthe sound mixer may call attention to the 'click' with an increase in volume; this helps to\nengage the audience in a moment of suspense.\nAsynchronous sound effects, on the other hand, are not matched with a visible source of\n \n1\n\nthe sound on screen. Such sounds are included so as to provide an appropriate emotional\nnuance, and they may also add to the realism of the film. For example, a film-maker might\nopt to include the background sound of an ambulance's siren while the foreground sound\nand image portrays an arguing couple. The asynchronous ambulance siren underscores\nthe psychic injury incurred in the argument; at the same time the noise of the siren adds to\nthe realism of the film by acknowledging the film's city setting.\nWe are probably all familiar with background music in films, which has become so\nubiquitous as to be noticeable in its absence. We are aware that it is used to add emotion\nand rhythm. Usually not meant to be noticeable, it often provides a tone or an emotional\nattitude toward the story and /or the characters depicted. In addition, background music\noften foreshadows a change in mood. For example, dissonant music may be used in film to\nindicate an approaching (but not yet visible) menace or disaster.\nBackground music may aid viewer understanding by linking scenes. For example, a\nparticular musical theme associated with an individual character or situation may be\nrepeated at various points in a film in order to remind the audience of salient motifs or\nideas.\nFilm sound comprises conventions and innovations. We have come to expect\nan acceleration of music during car chases and creaky doors in horror films. Yet, it is\nimportant to note as well that sound is often brilliantly conceived. The effects of sound are\noften largely subtle and often are noted by only our subconscious minds. We need to foster\nan awareness of film sound as well as film space so as to truly appreciate an art form that\nsprang to life during the twentieth century - the modern film.\n \n2",
