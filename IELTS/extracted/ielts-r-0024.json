  "passage_text": "Reading Practice\n \nA neuroscientist reveals how to think differently\nIn the last decade a revolution has occurred In the way that scientists think about\nthe brain.\nWe now know that the decisions humans make can be traced to the firing patterns of\nneurons in specific parts of the brain. These discoveries have led to the field known as\nneuroeconomics, which studies the brain's secrets to success in an economic environment\nthat demands innovation and being able to do things differently from competitors. A brain\nthat can do this is an iconoclastic one. Briefly, an iconoclast is a person who does\nsomething that others say can't be done.\nThis definition implies that iconoclasts are different from other people, but more precisely, it\nis their brains that are different in three distinct ways: perception, fear response, and\nsocial intelligence. Each of these three functions utilizes a different circuit in the brain.\nNaysayers might suggest that the brain is irrelevant, that thinking in an original, even\nrevolutionary, way is more a matter of personality than brain function. But the field of\nneuroeconomics was born out of the realization that the physical workings of the brain\nplace limitations on the way we make decisions. By understanding these constraints, we\nbegin to understand why some people march to a different drumbeat.\nThe first thing to realize is that the brain suffers from limited resources. It has a fixed\nenergy budget, about the same as a 40 watt light bulb, so it has evolved to work as\nefficiently as possible. This is where most people are impeded from being an iconoclast.\nFor example, when confronted with information streaming from the eyes, the brain will\ninterpret this information in the quickest way possible. Thus it will draw on both past\nexperience and any other source of information, such as what other people say, to make\nsense of what it is seeing. This happens all the time. The brain takes shortcuts that work so\nwell we are hardly ever aware of them.\nWe think our perceptions of the world are real, but they are only biological and electrical\nrumblings. Perception is not simply a product of what your eyes or ears transmit to your\nbrain. More than the physical reality of photons or sound waves, perception is a product of\nthe brain.\nPerception is central to iconoclasm. Iconoclasts see things differently to other people. Their\nbrains do not fall into efficiency pitfalls as much as the average person's brain. Iconoclasts,\neither because they were born that way or through learning, have found ways to work\naround the perceptual shortcuts that plague most people. Perception is not something that\nis hardwired into the brain. It is a learned process, which is both a curse and an opportunity\nfor change. The brain faces the fundamental problem of interpreting physical stimuli from\nthe senses. Everything the brain sees, hears, or touches has multiple interpretations. The\none that is ultimately chosen is simply the brain's best theory. In technical terms, these\nconjectures have their basis in the statistical likelihood of one interpretation over another\nand are heavily influenced by past experience and, importantly for potential iconoclasts,\nwhat other people say.\nThe best way to see things differently to other people is to bombard the brain with things it\nhas never encountered before. Novelty releases the perceptual process from the chains of\npast experience and forces the brain to make new judgments. Successful iconoclasts have\n \n1\n\nan extraordinary willingness to be exposed to what is fresh and different. Observation of\niconoclasts shows that they embrace novelty while most people avoid things that\nare different.\nThe problem with novelty, however, is that it tends to trigger the brain's fear system. Fear is\na major impediment to thinking like an iconoclast and stops the average person in\nhis tracks. There are many types of fear, but the two that inhibit iconoclastic thinking and\npeople generally find difficult to deal with are fear of uncertainty and fear of public ridicule.\nThese may seem like trivial phobias. But fear of public speaking, which everyone must do\nfrom time to time, afflicts one-third of the population. This makes it too common to be\nconsidered a mental disorder. It is simply a common variant of human nature, one which\niconoclasts do not let inhibit their reactions.\nFinally, to be successful iconoclasts, individuals must sell their ideas to other people. This\nis where social intelligence comes in. Social intelligence is the ability to understand\nand manage people in a business setting. In the last decade there has been an explosion\nof knowledge about the social brain and how the brain works when groups coordinate\ndecision making. Neuroscience has revealed which brain circuits are responsible for\nfunctions like understanding what other people think, empathy, fairness, and social identity.\nThese brain regions play key roles in whether people convince others of their ideas.\nPerception is important in social cognition too. The perception of someone's enthusiasm, or\nreputation, can make or break a deal. Understanding how perception becomes intertwined\nwith social decision making shows why successful iconoclasts are so rare.\nIconoclasts create new opportunities in every area from artistic expression to technology to\nbusiness. They supply creativity and innovation not easily accomplished by committees.\nRules aren't important to them. Iconoclasts face alienation and failure, but can also be a\nmajor asset to any organization. It is crucial for success in any field to understand how the\niconoclastic mind works.\n \n2",
