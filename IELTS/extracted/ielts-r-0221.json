  "passage_text": "Reading Practice\n \nIndoor Pollution\nSince the early eighties we have been only too aware of the devastating effects of large-\nscale environmental pollution. Such pollution is generally the result of poor government\nplanning in many developing nations or the short-sighted, selfish policies of the already\nindustrialised countries which encourage a minority of the world’s population to squander\nthe majority of its natural resources.\nWhile events such as the deforestation of the Amazon jungle or the nuclear disaster in\nChernobyl continue to receive high media exposure, as do acts of environmental sabotage,\nit must be remembered that not all pollution is on this grand scale. A large proportion of the\nworld’s pollution has its source much closer to home. The recent spillage of crude oil from\nan oil tanker accidentally discharging its cargo straight into Sydney Harbour not only\ncaused serious damage to the harbour foreshores but also created severely toxic fumes\nwhich hung over the suburbs for days and left the angry residents wondering how such a\ndisaster could have been allowed to happen.\nAvoiding pollution can be a fulltime job. Try not to inhale traffic fumes; keep away from\nchemical plants and building-sites; wear a mask when cycling. It is enough to make you\nwant to stay at home. But that, according to a growing body of scientific evidence, would\nalso be a bad idea. Research shows that levels of pollutants such as hazardous gases,\nparticulate matter and other chemical ‘nasties’ are usually higher indoors than out, even in\nthe most polluted cities. Since the average American spends 18 hours indoors for every\nhour outside, it looks as though many environmentalists may be attacking the wrong target.\nThe latest study, conducted by two environmental engineers, Richard Corsi and Cynthia\nHoward-Reed, of the University of Texas in Austin, and published in Environmental\nScience and Technology, suggests that it is the process of keeping clean that may be\nmaking indoor pollution worse. The researchers found that baths, showers, dishwashers\nand washing machines can all be significant sources of indoor pollution, because they\nextract trace amounts of chemicals from the water that they use and transfer them to the\nair.\nNearly all public water supplies contain very low concentrations of toxic chemicals, most of\nthem left over from the otherwise beneficial process of chlorination. Dr. Corsi wondered\nwhether they stay there when water is used, or whether they end up in the air that people\nbreathe. The team conducted a series of experiments in which known quantities of five\nsuch chemicals were mixed with water and passed through a dishwasher, a washing\nmachine, a shower head inside a shower stall or a tap in a bath, all inside a specially\ndesigned chamber. The levels of chemicals in the effluent water and in the air extracted\nfrom the chamber were then measured to see how much of each chemical had been\ntransferred from the water into the air.\nThe degree to which the most volatile elements could be removed from the water, a\nprocess known as chemical stripping, depended on a wide range of factors, including the\nvolatility of the chemical, the temperature of the water and the surface area available for\ntransfer. Dishwashers were found to be particularly effective: the high-temperature spray,\nsplashing against the crockery and cutlery, results in a nasty plume of toxic chemicals that\nescapes when the door is opened at the end of the cycle.\n \n1\n\nIn fact, in many cases, the degree of exposure to toxic chemicals in tap water by inhalation\nis comparable to the exposure that would result from drinking the stuff. This is significant\nbecause many people are so concerned about water-borne pollutants that they drink only\nbottled water, worldwide sales of which are forecast to reach $72 billion by next year. D.\nCorsi’s results suggest that they are being exposed to such pollutants anyway simply by\nbreathing at home.\nThe aim of such research is not, however, to encourage the use of gas masks when\nunloading the washing. Instead, it is to bring a sense of perspective to the debate about\npollution. According to Dr Corsi, disproportionate effort is wasted campaigning against\ncertain forms of outdoor pollution, when there is as much or more cause for concern\nindoors, right under people’s noses.\nUsing gas cookers or burning candles, for example, both result in indoor levels of carbon\nmonoxide and particulate matter that are just as high as those to be found outside, amid\nheavy traffic. Overcrowded classrooms whose ventilation systems were designed for\nsmaller numbers of children frequently contain levels of carbon dioxide that would be\nregarded as unacceptable on board a submarine. ‘New car smell’ is the result of high levels\nof toxic chemicals, not cleanliness. Laser printers, computers, carpets and paints all\ncontribute to the noxious indoor mix.\n \nThe implications of indoor pollution for health are unclear. But before worrying about the\nproblems caused by large-scale industry, it makes sense to consider the small-scale\npollution at home and welcome international debate about this.
