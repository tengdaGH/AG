Indian classical music has its\norigins as a meditation tool for attaining self realization. All different forms of these\nmelodies (ragas) are believed to affect various “chakras” (energy centers, or “mood”) in the\npath of the Kundalini. However, there is little mention of these esoteric beliefs in Bharat’s\nNatyashastra , the first treatise laying down the fundamental principles of drama, dance\nand music. The Samadeva, one of the four Vedas, created out of riga-veda so that its\nhymns could be sung as Samagana, established its first pop.\nIndian classical music has one of the most complex and complete musical systems ever\ndeveloped. Like Western classical music, it divides the octave s into 12 Semitones of which\nthe 7 basic notes are Sa Re Ga Ma Pa Dha Ni Sa, replacing Do Re Mi Fa So La Ti Do.\nHowever, it uses the just intonation tuning (unlike western classical music which uses the\nequal temperament tuning system).\nIndian classical music is monophonic in nature and based around a single melody line\nwhich is played over a fixed drone. The performance is based melodically on particular\nrages and rhythmically on talas.\nNATIONAL SYSTEM\nScholars of Europe in the seventeenth and eighteenth century were enormed by Indian\nmusic. With no facility to record the sound they explored for some existing system that\nmight exist system that express sounds in the composition. There were pointers to an\nancient notations system which scholars had also translated into Persian: still’ complexity\nof Indian classical music could not be expressed in writing. Though some western scholars\ndid record compositions in staff notation system, Indian musicians used Pt.Bhakhande\nsystem. Though more accurate, this relies on Devanagari script rather than symbols and\nhence is cumbersome at times. A new notation system has been proposed which uses\nsymbols and offers instantaneous comprehension like staff notation system. It is with\nstandardization of a notation system that hitherto unknown compositions would see the\nlight of day.\nINSTRUMENTS\nInstruments typically used in Hindustani music include sitar, sarood,tanpura, bansuri,\nshehnai, sarangi, and table.
