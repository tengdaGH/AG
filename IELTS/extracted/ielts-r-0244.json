  "passage_text": "Reading Practice\n \nLack of sleep\nSection A\nIt is estimated that the average man or woman needs between seven-and-a-half and eight\nhours' sleep a night. Some can manage on a lot less. Baroness Thatcher, for example, was\nreported to be able to get by on four hours' sleep a night when she was Prime Minister of\nBritain. Dr Jill Wilkinson, senior lecturer in psychology at Surrey University and co-author of\n'Psychology in Counselling and Therapeutic Practice', states that healthy individuals\nsleeping less than five hours or even as little as two hours in every 24 hours are rare, but\nrepresent a sizeable minority.\nSection B\nThe latest beliefs are that the main purposes of sleep are to enable the body to rest and\nreplenish, allowing time for repairs to take place and for tissue to be regenerated. One\nsupporting piece of evidence for this rest-and-repair theory is that production of the growth\nhormone somatotropin, which helps tissue to regenerate, peaks while we are asleep. Lack\nof sleep, however, can compromise the immune system, muddle thinking, cause\ndepression, promote anxiety and encourage irritability.\nSection C\nResearchers in San Diego deprived a group of men of sleep between 1am and 5am on just\none night, and found that levels of their bodies' natural defences against viral infections had\nfallen significantly when measured the following morning. 'Sleep is essential for our\nphysical and emotional well-being and there are few aspects of daily living that are not\ndisrupted by the lack of it', says Professor William Regelson of Virginia University, a\nspecialist in insomnia. 'Because it can seriously undermine the functioning of the immune\nsystem, sufferers are vulnerable to infection.'\nSection D\nFor many people, lack of sleep is rarely a matter of choice. Some have problems getting to\nsleep, others with staying asleep until the morning. Despite popular belief that sleep is one\nlong event, research shows that, in an average night, there are five stages of sleep and\nfour cycles, during which the sequence of stages is repeated.\nIn the first light phase, the heart rate and blood pressure go down and the muscles relax. In\nthe next two stages, sleep gets progressively deeper. In stage four, usually reached after\nan hour, the slumber is so deep that, if awoken, the sleeper would be confused and\ndisorientated. It is in this phase that sleep-walking can occur, with an average episode\nlasting no more than 15 minutes.\nIn the fifth stage, the rapid eye movement (REM) stage, the heartbeat quickly gets back to\nnormal levels, brain activity accelerates to daytime heights and above and the eyes move\nconstantly beneath closed lids as if the sleeper is looking at something. During this stage,\nthe body is almost paralysed. This REM phase is also the time when we dream.\nSection E\nSleeping patterns change with age, which is why many people over 60 develop insomnia.\nIn America, that age group consumes almost half the sleep medication on the market. One\ntheory for the age-related change is that it is due to hormonal changes. The temperature\nGeneral Training: Reading and Writing rise occurs at daybreak in the young, but at three or\n \n1\n\nfour in the morning in the elderly. Age aside, it is estimated that roughly one in three people\nsuffer some kind of sleep disturbance. Causes can be anything from pregnancy and stress\nto alcohol and heart disease. Smoking is a known handicap to sleep, with one survey\nshowing that ex-smokers got to sleep in 18 minutes rather than their earlier average of 52\nminutes.\nSection F\nApart from self-help therapy such as regular exercise, there are psychological treatments,\nincluding relaxation training and therapy aimed at getting rid of pre-sleep worries and\nanxieties. There is also sleep reduction therapy, where the aim is to improve sleep quality\nby strictly regulating the time people go to bed and when they get up. Medication is\nregarded by many as a last resort and often takes the form of sleeping pills, normally\nbenzodiazepines, which are minor tranquillisers.\nSection G\nProfessor Regelson advocates the use of melatonin for treating sleep disorders. Melatonin\nis a naturally secreted hormone, located in the pineal gland deep inside the brain. The main\nfunction of the hormone is to control the body's biological clock, so we know when to sleep\nand when to wake. The gland detects light reaching it through the eye; when there is no\nlight, it secretes the melatonin into the bloodstream, lowering the body temperature and\nhelping to induce sleep. Melatonin pills contain a synthetic version of the hormone and are\ncommonly used for jet lag as well as for sleep disturbance. John Nicholls, sales manager of\none of America's largest health food shops, claims that sales of the pill have increased\ndramatically. He explains that it is sold in capsules, tablets, lozenges and mixed with herbs.\nIt is not effective for all insomniacs, but many users have weaned themselves off sleeping\ntablets as a result of its application.\n \n2",
