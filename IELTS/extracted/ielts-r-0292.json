  "passage_text": "Reading Practice\n \nMotivating Drives\nScientists have been researching the way to get employees motivated for many years. This\nresearch in a relational study which builds the fundamental and comprehensive model for\nstudy. This is especially true when the business goal is to turn unmotivated teams into\nproductive ones. But their researchers have limitations. It is like studying the movements of\ncar without taking out the engine.\nMotivation is what drives people to succeed and plays a vital role in enhancing an\norganizational development. It is important to study the motivation of employees because it\nis related to the emotion and behavior of employees. Recent studies show there are four\ndrives for motivation. They are the drive to acquire, the drive to bond, the drive to\ncomprehend and the drive to defend.\nThe Drive to Acquire\nThe drive to acquire must be met to optimize the acquire aspect as well as the\nachievement element. Thus the way that outstanding performance is recognized, the type\nof perks that is provided to polish the career path. But sometimes a written letter of\nappreciation generates more motivation than a thousand dollar check, which can serve as\nthe invisible power to boost business engagement. Successful organizations and leaders\nnot only need to focus on the optimization of physical reward but also on moving other\nlevers within the organization that can drive motivation.\nThe Drive to Bond\nThe drive to bond is also key to driving motivation. There are many kinds of bonds between\npeople, like friendship, family. In company, employees also want to be an essential part of\ncompany. They want to belong to the company. Employees will be motivated if they find\npersonal belonging to the company. In the meantime, the most commitment will be\nachieved by the employee on condition that the force of motivation within the employee\naffects the direction, intensity and persistence of decision and behavior in company.\nThe Drive to Comprehend\nThe drive to comprehend motivates many employees to higher performance. For years, it\nhas been known that setting stretch goals can greatly impact performance. Organizations\nneed to ensure that the various job roles provide employees with simulation that challenges\nthem or allow them to grow. Employees don’t want to do meaningless things or\nmonotonous job. If the job didn’t provide them with personal meaning and fulfillment, they\nwill leave the company.\nThe Drive to Defend\nThe drive to defend is often the hardest lever to pull. This drive manifests itself as a quest\nto create and promote justice, fairness, and the ability to express ourselves freely. The\norganizational lever for this basic human motivator is resource allocation. This drive is also\nmet through an employee feeling connection to a company. If their companies are merged\nwith another, they will show worries.\nTwo studies have been done to find the relations between the four drives and motivation.\n \n1\n\nThe article based on two studies was finally published in Harvard Business Review. Most\nauthors’ arguments have laid emphasis on four-drive theory and actual investigations.\nUsing the results of the surveys which executed with employees from Fortune 500\ncompanies and other two global businesses (P company and H company), the article\nmentions about how independent drives influence employees’ behavior and how\norganizational levers boost employee motivation.\nThe studies show that the drive to bond is most related to fulfilling commitment, while the\ndrive to comprehend is most related to how much effort employees spend on works. The\ndrive to acquire can be satisfied by a rewarding system which ties rewards to\nperformances, and gives the best people opportunities for advancement. For drive to\ndefend, a study on the merging of P company and H company shows that employees in\nformer company show an unusual cooperating attitude.\nThe key to successfully motivate employees is to meet all drives. Each of these drives is\nimportant if we are to understand employee motivation. These four drives, while not\nnecessarily the only human drives, are the ones that are central to unified understanding of\nmodern human life.\n \n2",
