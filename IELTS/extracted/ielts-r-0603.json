  "passage_text": "Reading Practice\n \nVenus in transit\n \nJune 2004 saw the first passage, known as a ‘transit’, of the planet Venus across the face\nof the Sun in 122 years. Transits have helped shape our view of the whole Universe, as\nHeather Cooper and Nigel Henbest explain\nA\nOn 8 June 2004, more than half the population of the world were treated to a rare\nastronomical event. For over six hours, the planet Venus steadily inched its way over the\nsurface of the Sun. This ‘transit’ of Venus was the first since 6 December 1882. On\nthat occasion, the American astronomer Professor Simon Newcomb led a party to\nSouth Africa to observe the event. They were based at a girls’ school, where - it is alleged -\nthe combined forces of three schoolmistresses outperformed the professionals with\nthe accuracy of their observations.\nB\nFor centuries, transits of Venus have drawn explorers and astronomers alike to the four\ncorners of the globe. And you can put it all down to the extraordinary polymath Edmond\nHalley. In November 1677, Halley observed a transit of the innermost planet, Mercury, from\nthe desolate island of St Helena in the South Pacific. He realised that, from different\nlatitudes, the passage of the planet across the Sun’s disc would appear to differ. By timing\nthe transit from two widely-separated locations, teams of astronomers could calculate the\nparallax angle - the apparent difference in position of an astronomical body due to a\ndifference in the observer’s position. Calculating this angle would allow astronomers to\nmeasure what was then the ultimate goal: the distance of the Earth from the Sun. This\ndistance is known as the astronomical unit’ or AU.\n \nC    \nHalley was aware that the AU was one of the most fundamental of all\nastronomical measurements. Johannes Kepler, in the early 17th century, had shown that\nthe distances of the planets from the Sun governed their orbital speeds, which were\neasily measurable. But no-one had found a way to calculate accurate distances to the\nplanets from the Earth. The goal was to measure the AU; then, knowing the orbital speeds\nof all the other planets round the Sun, the scale of the Solar System would fall into\nplace. However, Halley realised that Mercury was so far away that its parallax angle would\nbe very difficult to determine. As Venus was closer to the Earth, its parallax angle would\nbe larger, and Halley worked out that by using Venus it would be possible to measure\nthe Suns distance to 1 part in 500. But there was a problem: transits of Venus, unlike those\nof Mercury, are rare, occurring in pairs roughly eight years apart every hundred or so years.\nNevertheless, he accurately predicted that Venus would cross the face of the Sun in both\n1761 and 1769 - though he didn’t survive to see either.\nD\nInspired by Halley’s suggestion of a way to pin down the scale of the Solar System, teams\n \n1\n\nof British and French astronomers set out on expeditions to places as diverse as India and\nSiberia. But things weren’t helped by Britain and France being at war. The person who\ndeserves most sympathy is the French astronomer Guillaume Le Gentil.\nHe was thwarted by the fact that the British were besieging his observation site at\nPondicherry in India. Fleeing on a French warship crossing the Indian Ocean, Le\nGentil saw a wonderful transit - but the ship’s pitching and rolling ruled out any attempt\nat making accurate observations. Undaunted, he remained south of the equator,\nkeeping himself busy by studying the islands of Mauritius and Madagascar before setting\noff to observe the next transit in the Philippines. Ironically after travelling nearly\n50,000 kilometres, his view was clouded out at the last moment, a very dispiriting\nexperience.\nE\nWhile the early transit timings were as precise as instruments would allow,\nthe measurements were dogged by the ‘black drop’ effect. When Venus begins to cross the\nSun’s disc, it looks smeared not circular - which makes it difficult to establish timings. This\nis due to diffraction of light. The second problem is that Venus exhibits a halo of light when\nit is seen just outside the Sun’s disc. While this showed astronomers that Venus was\nsurrounded by a thick layer of gases refracting sunlight around it, both effects made it\nimpossible to obtain accurate timings.\nF\nBut astronomers laboured hard to analyse the results of these expeditions to observe\nVenus transits. Johann Franz Encke, Director of the Berlin Observatory, finally determined\na value for the AU based on all these parallax measurements:\n153,340,000 km. Reasonably accurate for the time, that is quite close to today’s value of\n149,597,870 km, determined by radar, which has now superseded transits and all\nother methods in accuracy. The AU is a cosmic measuring rod, and the basis of how we\nscale the Universe today. The parallax principle can be extended to measure the distances\nto the stars. If we look at a star in January - when Earth is at one point in its orbit - it\nwill seem to be in a different position from where it appears six months later. Knowing\nthe width of Earth’s orbit, the parallax shift lets astronomers calculate the distance.\nG    \nJune 2004’s transit of Venus was thus more of an astronomical spectacle than\na scientifically important event. But such transits have paved the way for what might prove\nto be one of the most vital breakthroughs in the cosmos - detecting Earth-sized planets\norbiting other stars.\n \n2",
