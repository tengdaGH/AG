  "passage_text": "Reading Practice\n \nTV Addiction 2\nA. Excessive cravings do not necessarily involve physical substances. Gambling can\nbecome compulsive; sex can become obsessive. One activity, however, stands out for its\nprominence and ubiquity—the world’s most popular pastime, television. Most people admit\nto having a love-bate relationship with it. They complain about the “boob tube” and “couch\npotatoes,” then they settle into their sofas and grab the remote control. Parents commonly\nfret about their children’s viewing (if not their own). Even researchers who study TV for a\nliving marvel at the medium’s hold on them personally. Percy Tannenbaum of the\nUniversity of California at Berkeley has written: “Among life’s more embarrassing moments\nhave been countless occasions when I am engaged in conversation in a room while a TV\nset is on, and I cannot for the life of me stop from periodically glancing over to the screen.\nThis occurs not only during dull conversations but during reasonably interesting ones just\nas well.”\n \nB. Scientists have been studying the effects of television for decades, generally focusing\non whether watching violence on TV correlates with being violent in real life. Less attention\nhas been paid to the basic allure of the small screen—the medium, as opposed to the\nmessage.\nC. The term “TV addiction” is imprecise and laden with value judgments, but it captures the\nessence of a very real phenomenon. Psychologists and psychiatrists formally define\nsubstance dependence as a disorder characterized by criteria that include spending a great\ndeal of time using the substance; using it more often than one intends; thinking about\nreducing use or making repeated unsuccessful efforts to reduce use; giving up important\nsocial, family or occupational activities to use it; and reporting withdrawal symptoms when\none stops using it.\nD. All these criteria can apply to people who watch a lot of television. That does not mean\nthat watching television, in itself, is problematic. Television can teach and amuse; it can\nreach aesthetic heights; it can provide much needed distraction and escape. The difficulty\narises when people strongly sense that they ought not to watch as much as they do and yet\nfind themselves strangely unable to reduce their viewing. Some knowledge of how the\nmedium exerts its pull may help heavy viewers gain better control over their lives.\nE. The amount of time people spend watching television is astonishing. On average,\nindividuals in the industrialized world devote three hours a day to the pursuit—fully half of\ntheir leisure time, and more than on any single activity save work and sleep. At this rate,\nsomeone who lives to 75 would spend nine years in front of the tube. To some\ncommentators, this devotion means simply that people enjoy TV and make a conscious\ndecision to watch it. But if that is the whole story, why do so many people experience\nmisgivings about how much they view? In Gallup polls in 1992 and 1999, two out of five\nadult respondents and seven out of 10 teenagers said they spent too much time watching\nTV. Other surveys have consistently shown that roughly 10 percent of adults call\nthemselves TV addicts.\nF. What is it about TV that has such a hold on US? In part, the attraction seems to spring\nfrom our biological ‘orienting response.’ First described by Ivan Pavlov in 1927, the\n \n1\n\n \norienting response is our instinctive visual or auditory reaction to any sudden or novel\nstimulus. It is part of our evolutionary heritage, a built- in sensitivity to movement and\npotential predatory threats.\nG. In 1986 Byron Reeves of Stanford University, Esther Thorson of the University of\nMissouri and their colleagues began to study whether the simple formal features of\ntelevision-cuts, edits, zooms, pans, sudden noises—activate the orienting response,\nthereby keeping attention on the screen. By watching how brain waves were affected by\nformal features, the researchers concluded that these stylistic tricks can indeed trigger\ninvoluntary responses and ‘derive their attention-al value through the evolutionary\nsignificance of detecting movement…. It is the form, not the content, of television that is\nunique.’\n \nH. The orienting response may partly explain common viewer remarks such as: “If a\ntelevision is on, I just can’t keep my eyes off it,” “I don’t want to watch as much as I do, but I\ncan’t help it,” and “I feel hypnotized when I watch television.” In the years since Reeves and\nThorson published then pioneering work, researchers have delved deeper. Annie Lang’s\nresearch team at Indiana University has shown that heart rate decreases for four to six\nseconds after an orienting stimulus. In ads, action sequences and music videos, formal\nfeatures frequently come at a rate of one per second, thus activating the orienting response\ncontinuously.\nI. Lang and her colleagues have also investigated whether formal features affect people’s\nmemory of what they have seen. In one of their studies, participants watched a program\nand then filled out a score sheet. Increasing the frequency of edits (defined here as a\nchange from one camera angle to another in the same visual scene) improved memory\nrecognition, presumably because it focused attention on the screen. Increasing the\nfrequency of cuts—changes to a new visual scene-had a similar effect but only up to a\npoint. If the number of cuts exceeded 10 in two minutes, recognition dropped off sharply.\n \nJ. Producers of educational television for children have found that formal features can help\nlearning. But increasing the rate of cuts and edits eventually overloads the brain. Music\nvideos and commercials that use rapid intercutting of unrelated scenes are designed to\nhold attention more than they are to convey information. People may remember the name\nof the product or band, but the details of the ad itself float in one ear and out the other. The\norienting response is overworked. Viewers still attend to the screen, but they feel tired and\nworn out, with little compensating psychological reward. Our ESM findings show much the\nsame thing.\nK. Sometimes the memory of the product is very subtle. Many ads today are deliberately\noblique: they have an engaging story line, but it is hard to tell what they are trying to sell.\nAfterward you may not remember the product consciously. Yet advertisers believe that if\nthey have gotten your attention, when you later go to the store you will feel better or more\ncomfortable with a given product because you have a vague recollection of having heard of\nit.\n \n2",
