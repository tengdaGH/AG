Without\nhoneybees, the story goes, fields will be sterile, economies will collapse, and food will be\nscarce.\n \nB But what few accounts acknowledge is that what’s at risk is not itself a natural state of\naffairs. For one thing, in the United States, where CCD was first reported and has had its\ngreatest impacts, honeybees are not a native species. Pollination in modem agriculture\nisn’t alchemy, it’s industry. The total number of hives involved in the U.S. pollination\nindustry has been somewhere between 2.5 million and 3 million in recent years.\nMeanwhile, American farmers began using large quantities of organophosphate\ninsecticides, planted large-scale crop monocultures, and adopted “clean farming” practices\nthat scrubbed native vegetation from field margins and roadsides. These practices killed\nmany native bees outright—they’re as vulnerable to insecticides as any agricultural\npest—and made the agricultural landscape inhospitable to those that remained. Concern\nabout these practices and their effects on pollinators isn’t new—in her 1962 ecological\nalarm cry Silent Spring, Rachel Carson warned of a ‘Fruitless Fall’ that could result from the\ndisappearance of insect pollinators.\n \nC If that ‘Fruitless Fall, has not—yet—occurred, it may be largely thanks to the honeybee,\nwhich farmers turned to as the ability of wild pollinators to service crops declined. The\nhoneybee has been semi-domesticated since the time of the ancient Egyptians, but it\nwasn’t just familiarity that determined this choice: the bees’ biology is in many ways suited\nto the kind of agricultural system that was emerging. For example, honeybee hives can be\nclosed up and moved out of the way when pesticides are applied to a field. The bees are\ngeneralist pollinators, so they can be used to pollinate many different crops. And although\nthey are not the most efficient pollinator of every crop, honeybees have strength in\nnumbers, with 20,000 to 100,000 bees living in a single hive. “Without a doubt, if there was\none bee you wanted for agriculture, it would be the honeybee, “says Jim Cane, of the U.S.\nDepartment of Agriculture. The honeybee, in other words, has become a crucial cog in the\nmodem system of industrial agriculture. That system delivers more food, and more kinds of\nit, to more places, more cheaply than ever before. But that system is also vulnerable,\nbecause making a farm field into the photosynthetic equivalent of a factory floor, and\npollination into a series of continent-long assembly lines, also leaches out some of the\nresilience characteristic of natural ecosystems.\n \nD Breno Freitas, an agronomist, pointed out that in nature such a high degree of\nspecialization usually is a very dangerous game: it works well while all the rest is in\nequilibrium, but runs quickly to extinction at the least disbalance. In effect, by developing an\nagricultural system that is heavily reliant on a single pollinator species, we humans have\nbecome riskily overspecialized. And when the human-honeybee relationship is disrupted,\nas it has been by colony collapse disorder, the vulnerability of that agricultural system\nbegins to become clear.\nE In fact, a few wild bees are already being successfully managed for crop pollination. “The\nproblem is trying to provide native bees in adequate numbers on a reliable basis in a fairly\n \n1\n\n \nshort number of years in order to service the crop” Jim Cane says. “You’re talking millions\nof flowers per acre in a two-to three-week time frame, or less, for a lot of crops.” On the\nother hand, native bees can be much more efficient pollinators of certain crops than\nhoneybees, so you don’t need as many to do the job. For example, about 750 blue orchard\nbees (Osmia lignaria) can pollinate a hectare of apples or almonds, a task that would\nrequire roughly 50,000 to 150,000 honeybees. There are bee tinkerers engaged in similar\nwork in many comers of the world. In Brazil, Breno Freitas has found that Centris tarsata,\nthe native pollinator of wild cashew, can survive in commercial cashew orchards if growers\nprovide a source of floral oils, such as by interplanting their cashew trees with Caribbean\ncherry.\n \nF In certain places, native bees may already be doing more than they’re getting credit for.\nEcologist Rachael Winfree recently led a team that looked at pollination of four summer\ncrops (tomato, watermelon, peppers, and muskmelon) at 29 farms in the region of New\nJersey and Pennsylvania. Winfiree’s team identified 54 species of wild bees that visited\nthese crops, and found that wild bees were the most important pollinators in the system:\neven though managed honeybees were present on many of the farms, wild bees were\nresponsible for 62 percent of flower visits in the study. In another study focusing specifically\non watermelon, Winfree and her colleagues calculated that native bees alone could provide\nsufficient pollination at 90 percent of the 23 farms studied. By contrast, honeybees alone\ncould provide sufficient pollination at only 78 percent of farms.\n \nG “The region I work in is not typical of the way most food is produced” Winfree admits. In\nthe Delaware Valley, most farms and farm fields are relatively small, each fanner typically\ngrows a variety of crops, and farms are interspersed with suburbs and other types of land\nuse which means there are opportunities for homeowners to get involved in bee\nconservation, too. The landscape is a bee-friendly patchwork that provides a variety of\nnesting habitat and floral resources distributed among different kinds of crops, weedy field\nmargins, fallow fields, suburban neighborhoods, and semi natural habitat like old woodlots,\nall at a relatively small scale. In other words, ’’pollinator-friendly” farming practices would\nnot only aid pollination of agricultural crops, but also serve as a key element in the over all\nconservation strategy for wild pollinators, and often aid other wild species as well.\nH Of course, not all farmers will be able to implement all of these practices. And\nresearchers are suggesting a shift to a kind of polyglot agricultural system. For some small-\nscale farms, native bees may indeed be all that’s needed. For larger operations, a suite of\nmanaged bees—with honeybees filling the generalist role and other, native bees pollinating\nspecific crops—could be augmented by free pollination services from resurgent wild\npollinators. In other words, they’re saying, we still have an opportunity to replace a risky\nmonoculture with something diverse, resilient, and robust.\n \n2",
