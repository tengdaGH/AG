  "passage_text": "Reading Practice\n \n \nUK companies need more effective boards of directors\n \nA After a number of serious failures of governance (that is, how they are managed at the\nhighest level), companies in Britain, as well as elsewhere, should consider radical changes\nto their directors’ roles. It is clear that the role of a board director today is not an easy one.\nFollowing the 2008 financial meltdown, which resulted in a deeper and more prolonged\nperiod of economic downturn than anyone expected, the search for explanations in the\nmany post-mortems of the crisis has meant blame has been spread far and wide.\nGovernments, regulators, central banks and auditors have all been in the frame. The role of\nbank directors and management and their widely publicised failures have been extensively\npicked over and examined in reports, inquiries and commentaries.\n \nB The knock-on t of this scrutiny has been to make the governance of companies in\ngeneral an issue of intense public debate and has significantly increased the pressures on,\nand the responsibilities of, directors. At the simplest and most practical level, the time\ninvolved in fulfilling the demands of a board directorship has increased significantly, calling\ninto question the effectiveness of the classic model of corporate governance by part-time,\nindependent non-executive directors. Where once a board schedule may have consisted of\nbetween eight and ten meetings a year, in many companies the number of events requiring\nboard input and decisions has dramatically risen. Furthermore, the amount of reading and\npreparation required for each meeting is increasing. Agendas can become overloaded and\nthis can mean the time for constructive debate must necessarily be restricted in favour of\ngetting through the business.\n \nC Often, board business is devolved to committees in order to cope with the workload,\nwhich may be more efficient but can mean that the board as a whole is less involved in fully\naddressing some of the most important issues. It is not uncommon for the audit committee\nmeeting to last longer than the main board meeting itself. Process may take the place of\ndiscussion and be at the expense of real collaboration, so that boxes are ticked rather than\nissues tackled. D A radical solution, which may work for some very large companies whose\nbusinesses are extensive and complex, is the professional board, whose members would\nwork up to three or four days a week, supported by their own dedicated staff and advisers.\nThere are obvious risks to this and it would be important to establish clear guidelines for\nsuch a board to ensure that it did not step on the toes of management by becoming too\nengaged in the day-to-day running of the company. Problems of recruitment, remuneration\nand independence could also arise and this structure would not be appropriate for all\ncompanies. However, more professional and better-informed boards would have been\nparticularly appropriate for banks where the executives had access to information that part-\ntime non-executive directors lacked, leaving the latter unable to comprehend or anticipate\nthe 2008 crash.\nE One of the main criticisms of boards and their directors is that they do not focus\nsufficiently on longer-term matters of strategy, sustainability and governance, but instead\nconcentrate too much on short-term financial metrics. Regulatory requirements and the\nstructure of the market encourage this behaviour. The tyranny of quarterly reporting can\ndistort board decision-making, as directors have to ‘make the numbers’ every four months\nto meet the insatiable appetite of the market for more data. This serves to encourage the\ntrading methodology of a certain kind of investor who moves in and out of a stock without\nengaging in constructive dialogue with the company about strategy or performance, and is\n \n1\n\n \nsimply seeking a short¬ term financial gain. This effect has been made worse by the\nchanging profile of investors due to the globalisation of capital and the increasing use of\nautomated trading systems. Corporate culture adapts and management teams are largely\nincentivised to meet financial goals.\n \nF Compensation for chief executives has become a combat zone where pitched battles\nbetween investors, management and board members are fought, often behind closed\ndoors but increasingly frequently in the full glare of press attention. Many would argue that\nthis is in the interest of transparency and good governance as shareholders use their\nmuscle in the area of pay to pressure boards to remove underperforming chief executives.\nTheir powers to vote down executive remuneration policies increased when binding votes\ncame into force. The chair of the remuneration committee can be an exposed and lonely\nrole, as Alison Carnwath, chair of Barclays Bank’s remuneration committee, found when\nshe had to resign, having been roundly criticised for trying to defend the enormous bonus\nto be paid to the chief executive; the irony being that she was widely understood to have\nspoken out against it in the privacy of the committee.\nG The financial crisis stimulated a debate about the role and purpose of the company and a\nheightened awareness of corporate ethics. Trust in the corporation has been eroded and\nacademics such as Michael Sandel, in his thoughtful and bestselling book What Money\nCan’t Buy, are questioning the morality of capitalism and the market economy. Boards of\ncompanies in all sectors will need to widen their perspective to encompass these issues\nand this may involve a realignment of corporate goals. We live in challenging times.\n \n2",
