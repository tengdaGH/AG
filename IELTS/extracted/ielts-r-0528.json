  "passage_text": "Reading Practice\n \nThe pesticide-free village\nGerry Marten and Dona Glee Williams report on reliance on the Indian village of Punukula,\nso nearly destroyed by reliance on pesticides.\nAround 20 years ago, a handful of families migrated from the Guntur district of Andhra\nPradesh, south-east India, into Punukula, a community of around 900 people farming plots\nof between two and ten acres. The outsiders from Guntur brought cotton culture with them,\nand this attracted resident farmers by promising to bring in more hard cash than the mixed\ncrops they were already growing to eat and sell, such as millet, mung beans, chilli and rice.\nBut growing cotton meant using pesticides and fertilisers - until then a mystery to the\nmostly illiterate farmers of the community.\nLocal agro-chemical dealers obligingly filled the need for information and supplies.\nThese'middlemen' sold commercial seeds, fertilisers and insecticides on credit, and\nguaranteed purchase of the crop. They offered technical advice provided by the companies\nthat supplied their products. The farmers depend on the dealers. If they wanted to grow\ncotton - and they did - it seemed they had no choice.\nA quick ‘high’ of booming yields and incomes hooked growers during the early years of\ncotton in the region. Outlay on insecticides was fairly low because cotton pests hadn't\nmoved in yet. Many farmers were so impressed with the chemicals that they started using\nthem on their other crops as well. The immediate payoffs from chemically-dependent cotton\nagriculture both ensured and obscured the fact that the black dirt fields had gone into a\nfreefall of environmental degradation, dragged down by a chain of cause and effect.\nSoon cotton-eaters, such as bollworms and aphids, plagued the fields. Repeated spraying\nkilled off the most susceptible pests and left the strongest to reproduce and pass on their\nresistance to generations of ever-hardier offspring. As the bugs grew tougher and more\nabundant, farmers applied a greater variety and quantity of poisons, something mixing\n'cocktails' of as many as ten insecticides. At the same time, cotton was gobbling up the\nnutrients in the soil, leaving the growers no option but to invest in chemical fertilisers.\nBy the time some farmers tried to break free of their chemical dependence, insecticides\nhad already decimated the birds, wasps, beetles, and other predators that had once\nprovided natural control of crop pests. Without their balancing presence, pests ran riot if\ninsecticide was cut back. As outlays for fertilisers and insecticides escalated, the cost of\nproducing cotton mounted. Eventually the expense of chemical inputs outgrew the cash\nvalue of the crop, and farmers fell further and further into debt and poverty.\nTheir vicious cycle was only broken by the willingness of a prominent village elder to\nexperiment with something different. He had been among the first villagers to grow cotton,\nand he would be the first to try it without chemicals, as set out by a programme in Non-\nPesticide Management (NPM). This had been devised for Punukala with the help of a Non-\nGovernment Organisation called SECURE that had become aware of the hardships caused\nby the pesticide trap.\nIt involved turning to neem, a fast-growing, broad-leaved evergreen tree related to\nmahogany. Neem protects itself against insects by producing a multitude of natural\npesticides that have evolved specifically to defeat plant-eating insects. Thus they are\n \n1\n\ngenerally harmless to human and other animals, including birds and insects that eat pests.\nThe plant is native to India and Burma, where it has been used for centuries to control\npests and to promote health. To protect cotton, neem seeds are simply ground into a\npowder, soaked overnight in water, and sprayed onto the crop at least every 10 days.\nNeem cake applied to the soil kills insect pests and doubles as an organic fertiliser high in\nnitrogen. As neem grows locally and is easy to process, it is much less expensive than the\nchemical insecticides sold for profit by the dealers and their corporate suppliers.\nQuick, short-term gains had once pushed Punukula into chemical-dependent agriculture.\nNow they found that similar immediate rewards were helping to speed change in the other\ndirection: the harvest of the next 20 NPM farmers was as good as the harvest of farmers\nusing insecticides, and they came out ahead because they weren't buying insecticides,\ninstead of investing cash (in short supply) in chemicals, they invested time and labour in\nNPM practices.\nBy the end of 2000, all the farmers in Punukula village were using NPM rather than\nchemicals for cotton, and they began to use it on other crops as well. The was using it. The\nstatus and economic opportunities of women improved - neem change gathered\nmomentum as NPM became even more effective once everyone became a source of\nincome for some of them, as they gathered seeds from the surrounding area to sell for\nNPM in other villages. The improve situation meant that families could afford to put more\nland under cultivation.\nIn 2004, the panchayat (village government) formally declared Punukula to be a pesticide-\nfree village. And they have big plans for the future, such as water purification. The village\nnow serves as a model for disseminating NPM to other communities, with around 2000\nfarmers visiting each year.\nWhat began as a few farmers desperate to find a way to farm without poisons has become\na movement with the potential to pull an entire region back from ecological disaster.\n \n2",
