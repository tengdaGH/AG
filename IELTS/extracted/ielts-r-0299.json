  "passage_text": "Reading Practice\n \nMuseum Blockbuster\nA\n \nSince the 1980s, the term “blockbuster” has become the fashionable word for the special\nspectacular museum, art gallery or science centre exhibitions. These exhibitions have the\nability to attract large crowds and often large corporate sponsors. Here is one of some\nexisting definitions of a blockbuster: Put by Elsen (1984), a blockbuster is a “… large scale\nloan exhibition that people who normally don’t go to museums will stand in line for hours to\nsee …” James Rosenfield, writing in Direct Marketing in 1993, has described a successful\nblockbuster exhibition as a “… triumph of both curatorial and marketing skills …” My own\ndefinition for a blockbuster is “a popular, high profile exhibition on display for a limited\nperiod, that attracts the general public, who are prepared to both stand in line and pay a fee\nin order to partake in the exhibition.” What both Elsen and Rosenfield omit in their\ndescriptions of a blockbuster, is that people are prepared to pay a fee to see a blockbuster\nand that the term blockbuster can just as easily apply to a movie or a museum exhibition.\nB\nMerely naming an exhibition or movie a blockbuster, however, does not make it a\nblockbuster. The term can only apply when the item in question has had an overwhelmingly\nsuccessful response from the public. However, in literature from both the UK and USA the\nother words that also start to appear in descriptions of a blockbuster are “less scholarly”,\n“non-elitist” and “popularist”. Detractors argue that blockbusters are designed to appeal to\nthe lowest common denominator, while others extol the virtues of encouraging scholars to\ncooperate on projects and to provide exhibitions that cater for a broad selection of the\ncommunity rather than an elite sector.\nC\nMaintaining and increasing visitor levels is paramount in the new museology. This requires\ncontinued product development. Not only the creation or hiring of blockbuster exhibitions\nbut regular exhibition changes and innovations. In addition, the visiting public has become\ncustomers rather than visitors, and the skills that are valued in museums, science centres\nand galleries to keep the new customers coming through the door have changed. High on\nthe list of requirements are commercial, business, marketing and entrepreneurial skills.\nCurators are now administrators. Being a director of an art gallery no longer requires an\nArts Degree. As succinctly summarised in the Economist in 1994 “business nous and\npublic relation skills” were essential requirements for a director, and the ability to compete\nwith other museums to stage travelling exhibitions which draw huge crowds.\nD\nThe new museology has resulted in the convergence of museums, the heritage industry,\nand tourism, profit-making and pleasure-giving. This has given rise to much debate about\nthe appropriateness of adopting the activities of institutions so that they more closely reflect\nthe priorities of the market place and whether it is appropriate to see museums primarily as\ntourist attractions. At many institutions, you can now hold office functions in the display\nareas, or have dinner with the dinosaurs. Whatever commentators may think, managers of\n \n1\n\nmuseums, art galleries and science centres worldwide are looking for artful ways to blend\nculture and commerce, and blockbuster exhibitions are at the top of the list. But while\nblockbusters are all part of the new museology, there is proof that you don’t need a\nmuseum, science centre or art gallery to benefit from the drawing power of a blockbuster or\nto stage a blockbuster.\nE\nBut do blockbusters held in public institutions really create a surplus to fund other\nactivities? If the bottom line is profit, then according to the accounting records of many\nmajor museums and galleries, blockbusters do make money. For some museums\noverseas, it may be the money that they need to update parts of their collections or to\nrepair buildings that are in need of attention. For others in Australia, it may be the\nopportunity to illustrate that they are attempting to pay their way, by recovering part of their\noperating costs or funding other operating activities with off-budget revenue. This makes\nthe economic rationalists cheerful. However, not all exhibitions that are hailed to be\nblockbusters will be blockbusters, and some will not make money. It is also unlikely that the\naccounting systems of most institutions will recognise the real cost of either creating or\nhiring a blockbuster.\nF\nBlockbusters require large capital expenditure, and draw on resources across all branches\nof an organisation; however, the costs don’t end there. There is a Human Resource\nManagement cost in addition to a measurable ‘real’ dollar cost. Receiving a touring\nexhibition involves large expenditure as well, and draws resources from across functional\nmanagement structures in project management style. everyone from a general labourer to\na building servicing unit, the front of the house, technical, promotion, education and\nadministration staff, are required to perform additional tasks. Furthermore, as an increasing\nnumber of institutions in Australia try their hand at increasing visitor numbers, memberships\n(and therefore revenue), by staging blockbuster exhibitions, it may be less likely that\nblockbusters will continue to provide a surplus to subsidise other activities due to the\ncompetitive nature of the market. There are only so many consumer dollars to go around,\nand visitors will need to choose between blockbuster products.\nG\nUnfortunately, when the bottom-line is the most important objective to the mounting of\nblockbuster exhibitions, this same objective can be hard to maintain. Creating, mounting or\nhiring blockbusters is exhausting for staff, with the real costs throughout an institution\ndifficult to calculate. Although the direct aims may be financial, creating or hiring a\nblockbuster has many positive spin-offs; by raising their profile through a popular\nblockbuster exhibition, a museum will be seen in a more favorable light at budget time.\nBlockbusters mean crowds, and crowds are good for the local economy, providing\nincreased employment for shops, hotels, restaurants, the transport industry and retailers.\nBlockbusters expose staff to the vagaries and pressures of the market place and may lead\nto creative excellence. Either the success or failure of a blockbuster may highlight the need\nfor managers and policymakers to rethink their strategies. However, the new museology\nand the apparent trend towards blockbusters make it likely that museums, art galleries and\nparticularly science centres will be seen as part of the entertainment and tourism industry,\nrather than as cultural icons deserving of government and philanthropic support.\n \n2\n\nH\nPerhaps the best pathway to take is one that balances both blockbusters and regular\nexhibitions. However, this easy middle ground may only work if you have enough space,\nand have alternate sources of funding to continue to support the regular less exciting fare.\nPerhaps the advice should be to make sure that your regular activities and exhibitions are\nmore enticing, and find out what your local community wants from you. The question\n(trend) now at most museums and science centres, is “What blockbusters can we tour to\noverseas venues and will it be cost-effective?”\n \n3",
