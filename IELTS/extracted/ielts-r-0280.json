  "passage_text": "Reading Practice\n \nMau Piailug, ocean navigator\nMau sailed from Hawaii to Tahiti using traditional methods\nIn early 1976, Mau Piailug, a fisherman, led an expedition in which he sailed a traditional\nPolynesian boat across 2,500 miles of ocean from Hawaii to Tahiti. The Polynesiai\nVoyaging Society had organised the expedition. Its purpose was to find out if seafarers in\nthe distant past could have found their way from one island to the other without\nnavigational instruments, or whether the islands had been populated by accident. At the\ntime, Mau was the only man alive who knew how to navigate just by observing the stars,\nthe wind and the sea. He had never before sailed to Tahiti, which was a long way to the\nsouth. However, he understood how the wind and the sea behave around islands, so he\nwas confident he could find his way. The voyage took him and his crew a month to\ncomplete and he did it without a compass or charts.\nHis grandfather began the task of teaching him how to navigate when he was still a baby.\nHe showed him pools of water on the beach to teach him how the behaviour of the waves\nand wind changed in different places. Later, Mau used a circle of stones to memorise the\npositions of the stars. Each stone was laid out in the sand to represent a star.\nThe voyage proved that Hawaii’s first inhabitants came in small boats and navigated by\nreading the sea and the stars. Mau himself became a keen teacher, passing on his\ntraditional secrets to people of other cultures so that his knowledge would not be lost. He\nexplained the positions of the stars to his students, but he allowed them to write things\ndown because he knew they would never be able to remember everything as he had done.\n \n1",
