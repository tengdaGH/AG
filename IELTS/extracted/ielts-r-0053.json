  "passage_text": "Reading Practice\n \nAustralia's Megafauna Controversy\nJust how long did humans live side by side with megafauna in Australia? Barry Brook,\nRichard Gillespie and Paul Martin dispute previous claims of a lengthy coexistence\nOver the past 50 millennia, Australia has witnessed the extinction of many species of large\nanimals, including a rhinoceros-sized wombat and goannas the size of crocodiles Debate\nabout the possible cause of these extinctions has continued for more than 150 years and\none the crucial questions raised is how long humans and megafauna coexisted in Australia.\nWe need to know the overlap of time to make an informed choice between the two main\ntheories regarding the causes of these extinctions. If humans and megafauna coexisted for\na protracted period then climate change is the more likely cause. However, if the\nmegafauna became extinct shortly after the arrival of humans, then humans are the likely\nculprits\nThe archaeological site at Cuddie Springs in eastern Australia appears to be well\npreserved. This dusty claypan holds within its sediments a rich cache of flaked stone and\nseed-grinding tools, and side by side with these clear signals of human culture are the\nbones of a dozen or more species of megafauna. Drs Judith Field and Stephen Wroe of the\nUniversity of Sydney, who excavated the site, claim that it provides unequivocal evidence\nof a long overlap of humans and megafauna, and conclude that aridity leading up to the\nlast Ice Age brought about their eventual demise. In the long-standing explanation of this\nsite, artefacts such as stone tools and extinct animals remain were deposited over many\nthousands of years in an ephemeral lake- a body of water existing for a relatively short time\n- and remained in place and undisturbed until the present day.\nThere is no disputing the close association of bones and stones at Cuddie Springs, as both\nare found 1 to 1.7 metres below the modern surface. The dating of these layers is accurate:\nages for the sediments were obtained through radiocarbon dating of charcoal fragments\nand luminescence dating of sand grains from the same levels (revealing when a sample\nwas last exposed to sunlight). Intriguingly, some of the stone show surface features\nindicating their use for processing plants, and a few even have well-preserved blood and\nhair residues suggesting they were used in butchering animals.\nBut is the case proposed by Field aside Wroe clear-cut? We carried out a reanalyse of the\nscientific data from Cuddie Springs that brings into question their conclusions. The amount\nof anthropological evidence found at the site is remarkable: we estimate there are more\nthan 3 tonnes of charcoal and more than 300 tonnes of stone buried there. Field and Wroe\nestimate that there are approximately 20 million artefacts. This plethora of tools is hard to\nreconcile with a site that was only available for occupation when the lake was dry.\nFurthermore, no cultural features such as oven pits have been discovered. If the sediment\nlayers have remained undisturbed since being laid down, as Field and Wroe contend, then\nthe ages of those sediments should increase with depth. However, our analysis revealed a\nnumber of inconsistencies.\nFirst, the charcoal samples are all roughly 36,000 years old. Second, sand in the two upper\nlevels is considerably younger than charcoal from the same levels. Third, Field and Wroe\nsay that the tools and seed-grinding stones used for plant and animal processing are\naccient, yet they are very similar to implements found elsewhere that were in use only a\nfew thousand years ago. Also interest is the fact that a deep drill core made a mere 60\n \n1\n\nmetres from the site recovered no stone artefact or fossil bones whatsoever. These points\nsuggests strongly that the sediments have been moved about and some of the old charcoal\nhas been re-deposited in younger layers. Indeed, one sample of cow bone found I metre\nbelow the surface came from sediments where charcoal dated at 6,000 and 23,000 years\nold is mixed with 17,000-year-old sand. The megafauna bones themselves have not yet\ndated, although new technological developments make this a possibility in the near future.\nWe propose that the archaeologists have actually been sampling the debris carried by\nancient flood channels beneath the site, including charcoal transported from bushfires that\nintermittently occurred within the catchment. Flood events more likely explain the\naccumulation of megafauna remains, and could have mixed old bones With fresh deposits.\nEuropean graziers also disturbed the site in 1876 by constructing a well to provide water\ntheir cattle. Given the expense of well-digging, we speculate that the graziers made sure it\nwas protected from the damage caused by cattle hooves by lining the surface with small\nstones collected from further afield, including prehistoric quarries. This Idea Is consistent\nwith the thin layer of stones spread over a large area, with cattle occasionally breaking\nthrough the gravel surface and forcing the stone and even cattle bones deeper into the\nwaterlogged soil.\nThe lack of conclusive evidence that humans and megafauna coexisted for a lengthy\nperiod casts doubt on Field and Wroe's assertion that climate change was responsible for\nthe extinction of Australia's megafauna. However, we do not suggest that newly arrived,\nwell-armed hunters systematically slaughtered all the large beasts they encountered.\nRecent studies based on the biology of modern-day large\nMammals, combined with observations of people who still practise a traditional\nhuntergatherer lifestyle, reveal an unexpected paradox and suggest a further possible\nexplanation as to what happened. Using a mathematical model, It was found that a group\nof 10 people killing only one juvenile Diprotodon each year would be sufficient to bring\nabout the extinction of that spaces within 1,000 years. This suggests that here, as in other\nparts of the word, the arrival of humans in lands previously inhabited only by animals\ncreated a volatile combination in which large animals fared badly.\nNote: The Diprotodon (a rhinoceros-sized wombat), an example of Australia’s now extinct\nmegafauna\n \n2",
