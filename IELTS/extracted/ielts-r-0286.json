  "passage_text": "Reading Practice\n \nMental Gymnastics\nA. THE working day has just started at the head office of Barclays Bank in London.\nSeventeen staff are helping themselves to a buffet breakfast as young psychologist\nSebastian Bailey enters the room to begin the morning’s framing session. But this is no\nordinary training session. He’s not here to sharpen their finance or management skills. He’s\nhere to exercise their brains.\n \nB. Today’s workout, organised by a company called the Mind Gym in London, is entitled\n“having presence”. What follows is an intense 90-minute session in which this rather\nabstract concept is gradually broken down into a concrete set of feelings, mental tricks and\nbehaviours. At one point the bankers are instructed to shut then eyes and visualise\nthemselves filling the room and then the building. They finish up by walking around the\nroom acting out various levels of presence, from low-key to over the top.\nC. It’s easy to poke fun. Yet similar mental workouts are happening in corporate seminar\nrooms around the globe. The Mind Gym alone offers some 70 different sessions, including\nones on mental stamina, creativity for logical thinkers and “zoom learning”. Other outfits\ndraw more directly on the exercise analogy, offering “neurobics” courses with names like\n“brain sets” and “cerebral fitness”. Then there are books with titles like Pumping Ions, full of\nbrainteasers that claim to “flex your mind”, and software packages offering memory and\nspatial- awareness games.\n \nD. But whatever the style, the companies’ sales pitch is invariably the same— follow our\nroutines to shape and sculpt your brain or mind, just as you might tone and train your body.\nAnd, of course, they nearly all claim that their mental workouts draw on serious scientific\nresearch and thinking into how the brain works.\nE. One outfit, Brainergy of Cambridge, Massachusetts (motto: “Because your grey matter\nmatters”) puts it like this: “Studies have shown that mental exercise can cause changes in\nbrain anatomy and brain chemistry which promote increased mental efficiency and clarity.\nThe neuroscience is cutting-edge.” And on its website, Mind Gym trades on a quote from\nSusan Greenfield, one of Britain’s best known neuroscientists: “It’s a bit like going to the\ngym, if you exercise your brain it will grow.”\n \nF. Indeed, die Mind Gym originally planned to hold its sessions in a local health club, until\nits founders realised where the real money was to be made. Modem companies need\nflexible, bright thinkers and will seize on anything that claims to create them, especially if it\nlooks like a quick fix backed by science. But are neurobic workouts really backed by\nscience? And do we need them?\nG. Nor is there anything remotely high-tech about what Lawrence Katz, co- author of Keep\nYour Brain Alive, recommends. Katz, a neurobiologist at Duke University Medical School in\nNorth Carolina, argues that just as many of US fail to get enough physical exercise, so we\nalso lack sufficient mental stimulation to keep our brain in trim. Sine we are busy with jobs,\nfamily and housework. But most of this activity is repetitive routine. And any leisure time is\n \n1\n\nspent slumped in front of the TV.\n \nH. So, read a book upside down. Write or brush your teeth with your wrong hand. Feel your\nway around the room with your eyes shut. Sniff vanilla essence while listening intently to\norchestral music. Anything, says Katz, to break your normal mental routine. It will help\ninvigorate your brain, encouraging its cells to make new connections and pump out\nneuroteophins, substances that feed and sustain brain circuits.\nI. Well, up to a point it will. “What I’m really talking about is brain maintenance rather than\nbulking up your IQ,” Katz adds. Neurobics, in other words, is about letting your brain fulfill\nits potential. It cannot create super-brains. Can it achieve even that much, though?\nCertainly the brain is an organ that can adapt to the demands placed on it. Tests on animal\nbrain tissue, for example, have repeatedly shown that electrically stimulating the synapses\nthat connect nerve cells thought to be crucial to learning and reasoning, makes them\nstronger and more responsive. Brain scans suggest we use a lot more of our grey matter\nwhen carrying out new or strange tasks than when we’re doing well-rehearsed ones. Rats\nraised in bright cages with toys sprout more neural connections than rats raised in bare\ncages— suggesting perhaps that novelty and variety could be crucial to a developing brain.\nKatz, And neurologists have proved time and again that people who lose brain cells\nsuddenly during a stroke often sprout new connections to compensate for the\nloss—especially if they undergo extensive therapy to overcome any paralysis.\nJ. Guy Claxton, an educational psychologist at the University of Bristol, dismisses most of\nthe neurological approaches as “neuro-babble”. Nevertheless, there are specific mental\nskills we can learn, he contends. Desirable attributes such as creativity, mental flexibility,\nand even motivation, are not the fixed faculties that most of US think. They are thought\nhabits that can be learned. The problem, says Claxton, is that most of US never get proper\ntraining in these skills. We develop our own private set of mental strategies for tackling\ntasks and never learn anything explicitly. Worse still, because any learned skill— even\ndriving a car or brushing our teeth-quickly sinks out of consciousness, we can no longer\nsee the very thought habits we’re relying upon. Our mental tools become invisible to US.\n \nK. Claxton is the academic adviser to the Mind Gym. So not surprisingly, the company\nespouses his solution-that we must return our thought patterns to a conscious level,\nbecoming aware of the details of how we usually think. Only then can we start to practise\nbetter thought patterns, until eventually these become our new habits. Switching\nmetaphors, picture not gym classes, but tennis or football coaching.\nL. In practice, the training can seem quite mundane. For example, in one of the eight\ndifferent creativity workouts offered by the Mind Gym—entitled “creativity for logical\nthinkers” one of the mental strategies taught is to make a sensible suggestion, then\nimmediately pose its opposite. So, asked to spend five minutes inventing a new pizza, a\ngroup soon comes up with no topping, sweet topping, cold topping, price based on time of\nday, flat-rate prices and so on.\nM. Bailey agrees that the trick is simple. But it is surprising how few such tricks people\nhave to call upon when they are suddenly asked to be creative: “They tend to just label\nthemselves as uncreative, not realising that there are techniques that every creative person\nemploys.” Bailey says the aim is to introduce people to half a dozen or so such strategies in\n \n2\n\na session so that what at first seems like a dauntingly abstract mental task becomes a set\nof concrete, learnable behaviours. He admits this is not a short cut to genius.\nNeurologically, some people do start with quicker circuits or greater handling capacity.\nHowever, with the right kind of training he thinks we can dramatically increase how\nefficiently we use it.\nN. It is hard to prove that the training itself is effective. How do you measure a change in an\nemployee’s creativity levels, or memory skills? But staff certainly report feeling that such\nclasses have opened their eyes. So, neurological boosting or psychological training? At the\nmoment you can pay your money and take your choice. Claxton for one believes there is\nno reason why schools and universities shouldn’t spend more time teaching basic thinking\nskills, rather than trying to stuff heads with facts and hoping that effective thought habits\nare somehow absorbed by osmosis.\n \n3",
