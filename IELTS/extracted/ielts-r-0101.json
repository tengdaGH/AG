  "passage_text": "Reading Practice\n \nClimate Change and the Inuit\nThe threat posed by climate change in the Arctic and the problems faced by Canada's Inuit\npeople\nA\nUnusual incidents are being reported across the Arctic. Inuit families going off on\nsnowmobiles to prepare their summer hunting camps have found themselves cut off from\nhome by a sea of mud, following early thaws. There are reports of igloos losing their\ninsulating properties as the snow drips and refreezes, of lakes draining into the sea as\npermafrost melts, and sea ice breaking up earlier than usual, carrying seals beyond the\nreach of hunters. Climate change may still be a rather abstract idea to most of us, but in the\nArctic it is already having dramatic effects - if summertime ice continues to shrink at its\npresent rate, the Arctic Ocean could soon become virtually ice-free in summer. The knock-\non effects are likely to include more warming, cloudier skies, increased precipitation and\nhigher sea levels. Scientists are increasingly keen to find out what's going on because they\nconsider the Arctic the 'canary in the mine' for global warming - a warning of what's in store\nfor the rest of the world.\nB\nFor the Inuit the problem is urgent. They live in precarious balance with one of the toughest\nenvironments on earth. Climate change, whatever its causes, is a direct threat to their way\nof life. Nobody knows the Arctic as well as the locals, which is why they are not content\nsimply to stand back and let outside experts tell them what's happening. In Canada, where\nthe Inuit people are jealously guarding their hard-won autonomy in the country's newest\nterritory, Nunavut, they believe their best hope of survival in this changing environment lies\nin combining their ancestral knowledge with the best of modern science. This is a challenge\nin itself.\nC\nThe Canadian Arctic is a vast, treeless polar desert that's covered with snow for most of\nthe year. Venture into this terrain and you get some idea of the hardships facing\nanyone who calls this home. Farming is out of the question and nature offers meagre\npickings. Humans first settled in the Arctic a mere 4,500 years ago, surviving by exploiting\nsea mammals and fish. The environment tested them to the limits: sometimes the\ncolonists were successful, sometimes they failed and vanished. But around a thousand\nyears ago, one group emerged that was uniquely well adapted to cope with the\nArctic environment. These Thule people moved in from Alaska, bringing kayaks, sleds,\ndogs, pottery and iron tools. They are the ancestors of today's Inuit people.\nD\nLife for the descendants of the Thule people is still harsh. Nunavut is 1.9 million square\nkilometres of rock and ice, and a handful of islands around the North Pole. It's\ncurrently home to 2,500 people, all but a handful of them indigenous Inuit. Over the past\n40 years, most have abandoned their nomadic ways and settled in the territory's 28\nisolated communities, but they still rely heavily on nature to provide food and\n \n1\n\nclothing. Provisions available in local shops have to be flown into Nunavut on one of the\nmost costly air networks in the world, or brought by supply ship during the few ice-free\nweeks of summer. It would cost a family around £7,000 a year to replace meat they\nobtained themselves through hunting with imported meat. Economic opportunities are\nscarce, and for many people state benefits are their only income.\nE\nWhile the Inuit may not actually starve if hunting and trapping are curtailed by climate\nchange, there has certainly been an impact on people's health. Obesity, heart disease and\ndiabetes are beginning to appear in a people for whom these have never before been\nproblems. There has been a crisis of identity as the traditional skills of hunting, trapping\nand preparing skins have begun to disappear. In Nunavut's 'igloo and email' society, where\nadults who were born in igloos have children who may never have been out on the land,\nthere's a high incidence of depression.\nF\nWith so much at stake, the Inuit are determined to play a key role in teasing out the\nmysteries of climate change in the Arctic. Having survived there for centuries, they believe\ntheir wealth of traditional knowledge is vital to the task. And Western scientists are starting\nto draw on this wisdom, increasingly referred to as 'Inuit Qaujimajatuqangit', or IQ. 'In the\nearly days scientists ignored us when they came up here to study anything. They just\nfigured these people don't know very much so we won't ask them,' says John Amagoalik,\nan Inuit leader and politician. 'But in recent years IQ has had much more credibility and\nweight.' In fact it is now a requirement for anyone hoping to get permission to do research\nthat they consult the communities, who are helping to set the research agenda to reflect\ntheir most important concerns. They can turn down applications from scientists they believe\nwill work against their interests, or research projects that will impinge too much on their\ndaily lives and traditional activities.\nG\nSome scientists doubt the value of traditional knowledge because the occupation of the\nArctic doesn't go back far enough. Others, however, point out that the first weather stations\nin the far north date back just 50 years. There are still huge gaps in our environmental\nknowledge, and despite the scientific onslaught, many predictions are no more than best\nguesses. IQ could help to bridge the gap and resolve the tremendous uncertainty about\nhow much of what we're seeing is natural capriciousness and how much is the\nconsequence of human activity.\n \n2",
