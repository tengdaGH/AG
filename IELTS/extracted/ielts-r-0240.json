  "passage_text": "Reading Practice\n \nKeeping the water away\nNew approaches to flood control\nA. Recently, winter floods on the rivers of central Europe have been among the worst for\n600 to 700 years, and dams and dykes (protective sea walls) have failed to solve the\nproblem. Traditionally, river engineers have tried to get rid of the water quickly,\ndraining it off the land and down to the sea in rivers reengineered as high-\nperformance drains. But however high they build the artificial riverbanks, the floods\nkeep coming back. And when they come, they seem to be worse than ever\nB. Engineers are now turning to a different plan: to sap the water’s destructive strength\nby dispersing it into fields; forgotten lakes and floods plains. They are reviving river\nbends and marshes to curb the flow, and even plugging city drains to encourage\nfloodwater to use other means to go underground. Back in the days when rivers took\na winding path to the sea, floodwaters lost force and volume while meandering across\nflood plains and inland deltas, but today the water tends to have a direct passage to\nthe sea. This means that, when it rains in the uplands, the water comes down all at\nonce.\nC. Worse, when the flood plains are closed off, the river's flow downstream becomes\nmore violent and uncontrollable; by turning complex river systems into the simple\nmechanics of a water pipe, engineers have often created danger where they\npromised safety. The Rhine, Europe’s most engineered river; is a good example. For\na long time engineers have erased its backwaters and cut it off from its plain. The aim\nwas partly to improve navigation, and partly to speed floodwaters out of Alps and\ndown to the North Sea. Now, when it rains in the Alps, the peak flows from several\nbranches of the Rhine coincide where once they arrived separately, and with four-\nfifths of the Lower Rhine's flood plain barricaded off, the waters rise. The result is\nmore frequent flooding and greater damage. The same thing has happened in the US\non the Mississippi river, which drains the world’s second largest river catchment into\nthe Gulf of Mexico. Despite some $7 billion spent over the last century on levees\n(embankments) the situation is growing worse.\nD. Specialists in water control now say that a new approach is needed - one which takes\nthe whole landscape into consideration. To help keep London's feet dry, the UK\nEnvironment Agency is reflooding 10 square kilometres of the ancient flood plain of\nthe River Thames outside Oxford. Nearer to London, it has spent £100 million\ncreating new wetlands and a relief channel across 16 kilometres of flood plain.\nSimilar ideas ate being tested in Austria, in one of Europe's largest river restorations\nto date. The engineers calculate that the restored flood plain of the Drava River can\nnow store up to 10 million cubic metres of floodwater, and slow down storm surges\ncoming out of the Alps by more than an hour, protecting towns not only in Austria, but\nas far downstream as Slovenia and Croatia.\nE.\nThis nation, built largely on drained marshes and seabed, has had several severe\nshocks in the last two decades, when very large numbers of people have had to be\nThe Dutch, for whom preventing floods is a matter of survival, have gone furthest.\n \n1\n\nevacuated. Since that time, the Dutch have broken one of their most enduring\nnational stereotypes by allowing engineers to punch holes in dykes. They plan to\nreturn up to a sixth of the country to its former waterlogged state in order to better\nprotect the rest.\nF. Water use in cities also needs to change. At the moment, cities seem to create floods;\nthey are concreted and paved so that rains flow quickly into rivers. A new breed of\n‘soft engineers’ wants cities to porous, Berlin is one place where this is being done.\nTough new rules for new developments mean that drains will be prevented from\nbecoming overloaded after heavy rains. Architects of new urban buildings are\ndiverting rainwater from the roofs for use in toilets and the irrigation of roof gardens,\nwhile water falling onto the ground is collected in ponds, or passes underground\nthrough porous paving. One high-tech urban development can store a sixth of its\nannual rainfall, and reuse most of the rest\nG.\nWith non-porous surfaces covering 70% of the city, drainage is a huge challenge.\nBillions of dollars have been spent digging huge drains and concreting riverbeds, but\nmany communities still flood regularly. Meanwhile this desert city ships water from\nhundreds of kilometres away to fill its taps and swimming pool. Los Angeles has\nrecently launched a new scheme to utilise floodwater in the Sun Valley section of the\ncity. The plan is to catch the rain that falls on thousands of driveways, parking lots\nand rooftops in the valley. Trees will soak up water from parking lots; houses and\npublic buildings will capture roof water to irrigate gardens and parks, and road drains\nwill empty into old gravel pits to recharge the city's underground water reserves.\nResult: less flooding and more water for the city. It may sound expensive, until we\nrealise how much is spent trying to drain cities and protect areas from flooding, and\nbow little this method achieves.\nCould this be expanded to protect a whole city?
