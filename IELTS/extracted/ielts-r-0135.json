  "passage_text": "Reading Practice\n \nDirty River But Clean Water\n \nFloods can occur in rivers when the flow rate exceeds the capacity of the river channel,\nparticularly at bends or meanders in the waterway. Floods often cause damage to homes\nand businesses if they are in the natural flood plains of rivers. While riverine flood damage\ncan be eliminated by moving away from rivers and other bodies of water, people\nhave traditionally lived and worked by rivers because the land is usually flat and fertile and\nbecause rivers provide easy travel and access to commerce and industry.\n \nA   Fire and flood are two of humanity’s worst nightmares. People have,therefore,always\nsought to control them. Forest fires are snuffed out quickly. The flow of rivers is regulated\nby weirs and dams. At least, that is how it used to be. But foresters have learned that\nforests need fires to clear out the brash and even to get seeds to germinate. And a similar\nrevelation is now – dawning on hydrologists. Rivers – and the ecosystems they support –\nneed floods. That is why a man-made torrent has been surging down the Grand Canyon.\nBy Thursday March 6th it was running at full throttle, which was expected to be sustained\nfor 60 hours.\n \nB  Floods once raged through the canyon every year. Spring Snow from as far away as\nWyoming would melt and swell the Colorado river to a flow that averaged around 1,500\ncubic metres (50,000 cubic feet) a second. Every eight years or so, that figure rose to\nalmost 3,000 cubic metres. These floods infused the river with sediment, carved its\nbeaches and built its sandbars.\n \nC   However, in the four decades since the building of the Glen Canyon dam, just upstream\nof the Grand Canyon, the only sediment that it has collected has come from tiny,\nundammed tributaries. Even that has not been much use as those tributaries are not\npowerful enough to distribute the sediment in an ecologically valuable way.\n \nD   This lack of flooding has harmed local wildlife. The humpback chub,for example, thrived\nin the rust-redwaters of the Colorado. Recently, though, its population has crashed. At first\nsight, it looked as if the reason was that the chub were being eaten by trout introduced for\nsport fishing in the mid-20th century. But trout and chub co-existed until the Glen Canyon\ndam was built, so something else is going on. Steve Gloss, of the United States’ Geological\nSurvey (USGS), reckons that the chub’s decline is the result of their losing their most\nvaluable natural defense, the Colorado’s rusty sediment. The chub were well adapted to\nthe poor visibility created by the thick, red water which gave the river its name, and\ndepended on it to hide from predators. Without the cloudy water the chub became\nvulnerable.\nE   And the chub are not alone. In the years since the Glen Canyon dam was built, several\nspecies have vanished  altogether. These include the Colorado pike-minnow, the razorback\nsucker and the round-tail chub. Meanwhile, aliens including fathead minnows, channel\ncatfish and common carp, which would have been hard, put to survive in the savage waters\nof the undammed canyon, have move din.\nF   So flooding is the obvious answer. Unfortunately, it is easier said than done. Floods\nwere sent down the Grand Canyon in 1996 and 2004 and the results were mixed. In 1996\nthe flood was allowed to go on too long. To start with,all seemed well. The floodwaters built\nup sandbanks and infused the river with sediment. Eventually, however, the continued flow\n \n1\n\n \nwashed most of the sediment out of the canyon. This problem was avoided in 2004, but\nunfortunately, on that occasion, the volume of sand available behind the dam was too low\nto rebuild the sandbanks.
