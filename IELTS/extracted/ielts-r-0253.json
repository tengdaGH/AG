  "passage_text": "Reading Practice\n \nLearning to Walk\nThese days the feet of a typical city dweller rarely encounter terrain any more uneven than\na crack in the pavement. While that may not seem like a problem, it turns out that by\nflattening our urban environment we have put ourselves at risk of a surprising number of\nchronic illnesses and disabilities. Fortunately, the commercial market has come to the\nrescue with a choice of products. Research into the idea that flat floors could be detrimental\nto our health was pioneered back in the late 1960s in Long Beach, California. Podiatrist\nCharles Brantingham and physiologist Bruce Beekman were concerned with the growing\nepidemic of high blood pressure, varicose veins and deep-vein thromboses and reckoned\nthey might be linked to the uniformity of the surfaces that we tend to stand and walk on.\nThe trouble, they believed, was that walking continuously on flat floors, sidewalks and\nstreets concentrates forces on just a few areas of the foot. As a result, these surfaces are\nlikely to be far more conducive to chronic stress syndromes than natural surfaces, where\nthe foot meets the ground in a wide variety of orientations. They understood that the\nanatomy of the foot parallels that of the human hand - each having 26 bones, 33 joints and\nmore than 100 muscles, tendons and ligaments - and that modern lifestyles waste all this\npotential flexibility.\nBrantingham and Beekman became convinced that the damage could be rectified by\nmaking people wobble. To test their ideas, they got 65 factory workers to try standing on a\nvariable terrain floor - spongy mats with varying degrees of resistance across the surface.\nThis modest irregularity allowed the soles of the volunteers' feet to deviate slightly from the\nhorizontal each time they shifted position. As the researchers hoped, this simple\nintervention made a huge difference, within a few weeks. Even if people were wobbling\nslightly, it activated a host of muscles in their legs, which in turn helped pump blood back to\ntheir hearts. The muscle action prevented the pooling of blood in their feet and legs,\nreducing the stress on the heart and circulation. Yet decades later, the flooring of the\nworld's largest workplaces remains relentlessly smooth. Earlier this year, however, the idea\nwas revived when other researchers in the US announced findings from a similar\nexperiment with people over 60. John Fisher and colleagues at the Oregon Research\nInstitute in Eugene designed a mat intended to replicate the effect of walking on\ncobblestones*.\nIn tests funded by the National Institute of Aging, they got some 50 adults to walk on the\ntoots in their bare feet for less than an hour, three times a week. After 16 weeks, these\npeople showed marked improvements in mobility, and even a significant reduction in blood\npressure. People in a control group who walked on ordinary floors also improved but not as\ndramatically. The mats are now available for purchase and production is being scaled up.\nEven so, demand could exceed supply if this footstimulating activity really is a 'useful\nnonpharmacological approach for preventing or controlling hypertension of older adults, as\nthe researchers believe. They are not alone in recognising the benefits of cobblestones.\nReflexologists have long advocated walking on textured surfaces to stimulate so-called\n'acupoints' on the soles of the feet. They believe that pressure applied to particular spots\non the foot connects directly to particular organs of the body and somehow enhances their\nfunction. In China, spas, apartment blocks and even factories promote their cobblestone\npaths as healthful amenities. Fisher admits he got the concept from regular visits to the\ncountry. Here, city dwellers take daily walks along cobbled paths for five or ten minutes,\n \n1\n\nperhaps several times a day, to improve their health. The idea is now taking off in Europe\ntoo.\nPeople in Germany, Austria and Switzerland can now visit 'barefoot parks' and walk\nalong 'paths of the senses - with mud, logs, stone and moss underfoot. And it is not difficult\nto construct your own path with simple everyday objects such as stones or bamboo poles.\nBut if none of these solutions appeal, there is another option. A new shoe on the market\nclaims to transform flat, hard, artificial surfaces into something like uneven ground. 'These\nshoes have an unbelievable effect,' says Benno Nigg, an exercise scientist at Calgary\nUniversity in Canada.\nKnown as the Masai Barefoot Technology, the shoes have rounded soles that cause you to\nrock slightly when you stand still, exercising the small muscles around the ankle that are\nresponsible for stability. Forces in the joint are reduced, putting less strain on the\nsystem, Nigg claims.\nSome of these options may not appeal to all consumers and there is a far simpler\nalternative.\nIf the urban environment is detrimental to our health, then it is obvious where we should\nturn. A weekend or even a few hours spent in the countryside could help alleviate a\nsufferer's aches and pains, and would require only the spending of time.\nHowever, for many modern citizens, the countryside is not as accessible as it once was\nand is in fact a dwindling resource. Our concrete cities are growing at a terrifying rate -\nperhaps at the same rate as our health problems.\n \n2",
