  "passage_text": "Reading Practice\n \nKoalas\nA. Koalas are just too nice for their own good. And except for the occasional baby taken by\nbirds of prey, koalas have no natural enemies. In an ideal world, the life of an arboreal\ncouch potato would be perfectly safe and acceptable.\n \nB. Just two hundred years ago, koalas flourished across Australia. Now they seem to be in\ndecline, but exact numbers are not available as the species would not seem to be ‘under\nthreat’. Their problem, however, has been man, more specifically, the white man. Koala\nand aborigine had co-existed peacefully for centuries.\nC. Today koalas are found only in scattered pockets of southeast Australia, where they\nseem to be at risk on several fronts. The koala’s only food source, the eucalyptus tree has\ndeclined. In the past 200 years, a third of Australia’s eucalyptus forests have disappeared.\nKoalas have been killed by parasites, chlamydia epidemics and a tumour-causing retro-\nvirus. And every year 11000 are killed by cars, ironically most of them in wildlife\nsanctuaries, and thousands are killed by poachers. Some are also taken illegally as pets.\nThe animals usually soon die, but they are easily replaced.\nD. Bush fires pose another threat. The horrific ones that raged in New South Wales\nrecently killed between 100 and 1000 koalas. Many that were taken into sanctuaries and\nshelters were found to have burnt their paws on the glowing embers. But zoologists say\nthat the species should recover. The koalas will be aided by the eucalyptus, which grows\nquickly and is already burgeoning forth after the fires. So the main problem to their survival\nis their slow reproductive rate – they produce only one baby a year over a reproductive\nlifespan of about nine years.\n \nE. The latest problem for the species is perhaps more insidious. With plush, grey fur, dark\namber eyes and button nose, koalas are cuddliness incarnate. Australian zoos and wildlife\nparks have taken advantage of their uncomplaining attitudes, and charge visitors to be\nphotographed hugging the furry bundles. But people may not realise how cruel this is, but\nbecause of the koala’s delicate disposition, constant handling can push an already\nprecariously balanced physiology over the edge.\nF. Koalas only eat the foliage of certain species of eucalyptus trees, between 600 and 1250\ngrams a day. The tough leaves are packed with cellulose, tannins, aromatic oils and\nprecursors of toxic cyanides. To handle this cocktail, koalas have a specialised digestive\nsystem. Cellulose- digesting bacteria in the break down fibre, while a specially adapted gut\nand liver process the toxins. To digest their food properly, koalas must sit still for 21 hours\nevery day.\n \nG. Koalas are the epitome of innocence and inoffensiveness. Although they are capable of\nripping open a man’s arm with their needle-sharp claws, or giving a nasty nip, they simply\nwouldn’t. If you upset a koala, it may blink or swallow, or hiccup. But attack? No way!\nKoalas are just not aggressive. They use their claws to grip the hard smooth bark of\neucalyptus trees.\n \n1\n\n \nH. They are also very sensitive, and the slightest upset can prevent them from breeding,\ncause them to go off their food, and succumb to gut infections. Koalas are stoic creatures\nand put on a brave face until they are at death’s door. One day they may appear healthy,\nthe next they could be dead. Captive koalas have to be weighed daily to check that they\nare feeding properly. A sudden loss of weight is usually the only warning keepers have that\ntheir charge is ill. Only two keepers plus a vet were allowed to handle London Zoo’s koalas,\nas these creatures are only comfortable with people they know. A request for the koala to\nbe taken to meet the Queen was refused because of the distress this would have caused\nthe marsupial. Sadly, London’s Zoo no longer has a koala. Two years ago the female koala\ndied of a cancer caused by a retrovirus. When they come into heat, female koalas become\nmore active, and start losing weight, but after about sixteen days, heat ends and the weight\npiles back on. London’s koala did not. Surgery revealed hundreds of pea-sized tumours.\nAlmost every zoo in Australia has koalas – the marsupial has become the Animal\nAmbassador of the nation, but nowhere outside Australia would handling by the public be\nallowed. Koala cuddling screams in the face of every rule of good care. First, some zoos\nallow koalas to be passed from stranger to stranger, many children who love to squeeze.\nSecondly, most people have no idea of how to handle the animals; they like to cling on to\ntheir handler, all in their own good time and use his or her arm as a tree. For such reasons,\nthe Association of Fauna and Marine parks, an Australian conservation society is\ncampaigning to ban koala cuddling. Policy on koala handling is determined by state\ngovernment authorities. “And the largest of the numbers in the Australian Nature\nConservation Agency, with the aim of instituting national guidelines. Following a wave of\npublicity, some zoos and wildlife parks have stopped turning their koalas into photo.\n \n2",
