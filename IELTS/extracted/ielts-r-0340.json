  "passage_text": "Reading Practice\n \nPlay is a serious business\nDoes play help develop bigger, better brains?\n \nBryant Furlow investigates\nA\nPlaying is a serious business. Children engrossed in a make-believe world, fox cubs play-\nfighting or kittens teasing a ball of string aren’t just having fun. Play may look like a carefree\nand exuberant way to pass the time before the hard work of adulthood comes along, but\nthere’s much more to it than that. For a start, play can even cost animals their lives. Eighty\nper cent of deaths among juvenile fur seals occur because playing pups fail to spot\npredators approaching. It is also extremely expensive in terms of energy. Playful young\nanimals use around two or three per cent of their energy cavorting, and in children that\nfigure can be closer to fifteen per cent. ‘Even two or three per cent is huge,’ says John\nByers of Idaho University. ‘You just don’t find animals wasting energy like that,’ he adds.\nThere must be a reason.\nB\nBut if play is not simply a developmental hiccup, as biologists once thought, why did it\nevolve? The latest idea suggests that play has evolved to build big brains. In other words,\nplaying makes you intelligent. Playfulness, it seems, is common only among mammals,\nalthough a few of the larger-brained birds also indulge. Animals at play often use unique\nsigns - tail- wagging in dogs, for example - to indicate that activity superficially resembling\nadult behaviour is not really in earnest. A popular explanation of play has been that it helps\njuveniles develop the skills they will need to hunt, mate and socialise as adults. Another\nhas been that it allows young animals to get in shape for adult life by improving their\nrespiratory endurance. Both these ideas have been questioned in recent years.\nC\nTake the exercise theory. If play evolved to build muscle or as a kind of endurance training,\nthen you would expect to see permanent benefits. But Byers points out that the benefits of\nincreased exercise disappear rapidly after training stops, so any improvement in endurance\nresulting from juvenile play would be lost by adulthood. ‘If the function of play was to get\ninto shape,’ says Byers, ‘the optimum time for playing would depend on when it was most\nadvantageous for the young of a particular species to do so. But it doesn’t work like that.’\nAcross species, play tends to peak about halfway through the suckling stage and then\ndecline.\nD\nThen there’s the skills-training hypothesis. At first glance, playing animals do appear to be\npractising the complex manoeuvres they will need in adulthood. But a closer inspection\nreveals this interpretation as too simplistic. In one study, behavioural ecologist Tim Caro,\nfrom the University of California, looked at the predatory play of kittens and their predatory\nbehaviour when they reached adulthood. He found that the way the cats played had no\n \n1\n\nsignificant effect on their hunting prowess in later life.\nE\nEarlier this year, Sergio Pellis of Lethbridge University, Canada, reported that there is a\nstrong positive link between brain size and playfulness among mammals in general.\nComparing measurements for fifteen orders of mammal, he and his team found larger\nbrains (for a given body size) are linked to greater playfulness. The converse was also\nfound to be true. Robert Barton of Durham University believes that, because large brains\nare more sensitive to developmental stimuli than smaller brains, they require more play to\nhelp mould them for adulthood. ‘I concluded it’s to do with learning, and with the\nimportance of environmental data to the brain during development,’ he says.\nF\nAccording to Byers, the timing of the playful stage in young animals provides an important\nclue to what’s going on. If you plot the amount of time a juvenile devotes to play each day\nover the course of its development, you discover a pattern typically associated with a\n‘sensitive period’ - a brief development window during which the brain can actually be\nmodified in ways that are not possible earlier or later in life. Think of the relative ease with\nwhich young children - but not infants or adults - absorb language. Other researchers have\nfound that play in cats, rats and mice is at its most intense just as this ‘window of\nopportunity’ reaches its peak.\nG\n‘People have not paid enough attention to the amount of the brain activated by play,’ says\nMarc Bekoff from Colorado University. Bekoff studied coyote pups at play and found that\nthe kind of behaviour involved was markedly more variable and unpredictable than that of\nadults. Such behaviour activates many different parts of the brain, he reasons. Bekoff\nlikens it to a behavioural kaleidoscope, with animals at play jumping rapidly between\nactivities. ‘They use behaviour from a lot of different contexts - predation, aggression,\nreproduction,’ he says. ‘Their developing brain is getting all sorts of stimulation.’\nH\nNot only is more of the brain involved in play than was suspected, but it also seems to\nactivate higher cognitive processes. ‘There’s enormous cognitive involvement in play,’ says\nBekoff. He points out that play often involves complex assessments of playmates, ideas of\nreciprocity and the use of specialised signals and rules. He believes that play creates a\nbrain that has greater behavioural flexibility and improved potential for learning later in life.\nThe idea is backed up by the work of Stephen Siviy of Gettysburg College. Siviy studied\nhow bouts of play affected the brain’s levels of a particular chemical associated with the\nstimulation and growth of nerve cells. He was surprised by the extent of the activation.\n‘Play just lights everything up,’ he says. By allowing link-ups between brain areas that\nmight not normally communicate with each other, play may enhance creativity. \nI\nWhat might further experimentation suggest about the way children are raised in many\nsocieties today? We already know that rat pups denied the chance to play grow smaller\nbrain components and fail to develop the ability to apply social rules when they interact with\ntheir peers. With schooling beginning earlier and becoming increasingly exam-orientated,\n \n2\n\nplay is likely to get even less of a look-in. Who knows what the result of that will be?\n \n3",
