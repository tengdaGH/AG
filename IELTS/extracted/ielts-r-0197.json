  "passage_text": "Reading Practice\n \nHealth in the Wild\nA\nFor the past decade Dr Engel, a lecturer in environmental sciences at Britain’s Open\nUniversity, has been collating examples of self-medicating behaviour in wild animals. She\nrecently published a book on the subject. In a talk at the Edinburgh Science Festival earlier\nthis month, she explained that the idea that animals can treat themselves has been\nregarded with some scepticism by her colleagues in the past. But a growing number of\nanimal behaviourists now think that wild animals can and do deal with their own medical\nneeds.\nB\nOne example of self-medication was discovered in 1987. Michael Huffman and Mohamedi\nSeifu, working in the Mahale Mountains National Park in Tanzania, noticed that local\nchimpanzees suffering from intestinal worms would dose themselves with the pith of a plant\ncalled Veronia. This plant produces poisonous chemicals called terpenes. Its pith contains\na strong enough concentration to kill gut parasites, but not so strong as to kill chimps (nor\npeople, for that matter; locals use the pith for the same purpose). Given that the plant is\nknown locally as “goat-killer”, however, it seems that not all animals are as smart as chimps\nand humans. Some consume it indiscriminately and succumb.\nC\nSince the Veronia-eating chimps were discovered, more evidence has emerged suggesting\nthat animals often eat things for medical rather than nutritional reasons. Many species, for\nexample, consume dirt a behaviour known as geophagy. Historically, the preferred\nexplanation was that soil supplies minerals such as salt. But geophagy occurs in areas\nwhere the earth is not a useful source of minerals, and also in places where minerals can\nbe more easily obtained from certain plants that are known to be rich in them. Clearly, the\nanimals must be getting something else out of eating earth.\nD\nThe current belief is that soil—and particularly the clay in it—helps to detoxify the defensive\npoisons that some plants produce in an attempt to prevent themselves from being eaten.\nEvidence for the detoxifying nature of clay came in 1999, from an experiment carried out on\nmacaws by James Gilardi and his colleagues at the University of California, Davis. Macaws\neat seeds containing alkaloids, a group of chemicals that has some notoriously toxic\nmembers, such as strychnine. In the wild, the birds are frequently seen perched on eroding\nriverbanks eating clay. Dr Gilardi fed one group of macaws a mixture of harmless alkaloid\nand clay, and a second group just the alkaloid. Several hours later, the macaws that had\neaten the clay had 60% less alkaloid in their bloodstreams than those that had not,\nsuggesting that the hypothesis is correct.\nE\nOther observations also support the idea that clay is detoxifying. Towards the tropics, the\namount of toxic compounds in plants increases-and so does the amount of earth eaten by\nherbivores. Elephants lick clay from mud holes all year round, except in September when\n \n1\n\nthey are bingeing on fruit which, because it has evolved to be eaten, is not toxic. And the\naddition of clay to the diets of domestic cattle increases the amount of nutrients that they\ncan absorb from their food by 10-20%.\nF\nA third instance of animal self-medication is the use of mechanical scours to get rid of gut\nparasites, in 1972 Richard Wrangham, a researcher at the Gombe Stream Reserve in\nTanzania, noticed that chimpanzees were eating the leaves of a tree called Aspilia. The\nchimps chose the leaves carefully by testing them in their mouths. Having chosen a leaf, a\nchimp would fold it into a fan and swallow it. Some of the chimps were noticed wrinkling\ntheir noses as they swallowed these leaves, suggesting the experience was unpleasant.\nLater, undigested leaves were found on the forest floor.\nG\nDr Wrangham rightly guessed that the leaves had a medicinal purpose—this was, indeed,\none of the earliest interpretations of a behaviour pattern as self-medication. However, he\nguessed wrong about what the mechanism was. His (and everybody else’s) assumption\nwas that Aspilia contained a drug, and this sparked more than two decades of\nphytochemical research to try to find out what chemical the chimps were after.  But by the\n1990s, chimps across Africa had been seen swallowing the leaves of 19 different species\nthat seemed to have few suitable chemicals in common. The drug hypothesis was looking\nmore and more dubious.\nH\nIt was Dr Huffman who got to the bottom of the problem.  He did so by watching what came\nout of the chimps, rather than concentrating on what went in. He found that the egested\nleaves were full of intestinal worms. The factor common to all 19 species of leaves\nswallowed by the chimps was that they were covered with microscopic hooks. These\ncaught the worms and dragged them from their lodgings.\nI\nFollowing that observation, Dr Engel is now particularly excited about how knowledge of\nthe way that animals look after themselves could be used to improve the health of\nlivestock. People might also be able to learn a thing or two, and may, indeed, already have\ndone so. Geophagy, for example, is a common behaviour in many parts of the world. The\nmedical stalls in African markets frequently sell tablets made of different sorts of clays,\nappropriate to different medical conditions.\nJ\nAfricans brought to the Americas as slaves continued this tradition, which gave their\nowners one more excuse to affect to despise them. Yet, as Dr Engel points out, Rwandan\nmountain gorillas eat a type of clay rather similar to kaolinite – the main ingredient of many\npatent medicines sold over the counter in the West for digestive complaints. Dirt can\nsometimes be good for you, and to be “as sick as a parrot” may, after all, be a state to be\ndesired.\n \n2",
