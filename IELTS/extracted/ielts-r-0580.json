  "passage_text": "Reading Practice\n \nThree ways to Levitate a Magic Carpet\nIt sounds like a science fiction joke, but it isn’t. What do you get when you turn an invisibility\ncloak on its side? A mini flying carpet. So say physicists who believe the same exotic\nmaterials used to make cloaking devices could also be used to levitate tiny objects. In a\nfurther breakthrough, two other research groups have come a step closer to cracking the\nmysteries of levitation.\nScientists have levitated objects before, most famously using powerful magnetic fields to\nlevitate a frog. But that technique, using the repulsive force of a giant magnet, requires\nlarge amounts of energy. In contrast, the latest theories exploit the natural smaller amounts\nof energy produced by the quantum fluctuations of empty space.\nIn May 2006, two research teams led by Ulf Leonhardt at St Andrew’s University, UK, and\nJohn Pendry at Imperial College, London, independently proposed that an invisibility cloak\ncould be created from exotic materials with abnormal optical properties. Such a cloaking\ndevice – working in the microwave region – was manufactured later that year.\nThe device was formed from so-called ‘meta materia Is’ exotic materials made from\ncomplex arrays of metal units and wires. The metal units are smaller than the wavelength\nof light and so the materials can be engineered to precisely control how electromagnetic\nlight waves travel around them. They can transform space, tricking electromagnetic waves\ninto moving along directions they otherwise wouldn’t,’says Leonhardt.\nLeonhardt and his colleague Thomas Philbin, also at St Andrew’s University, realised that\nthis property could also be exploited to levitate extremely small objects. They propose\ninserting a metamaterial between two so-called Casimir plates. When two such plates are\nbrought very close together, the vacuum between them becomes filled with quantum\nfluctuations of the electromagnetic field. As two plates are brought closer together, fewer\nfluctuations can occur within the gap between them, but on the outer sides of the plates,\nthe fluctuations are unconstrained. This causes a pressure difference on either side of the\nplates, forcing the plates to stick together, in a phenomenon called the Casimir effect.\nLeonhardt and Philbin believe that inserting a section of metamaterial between the plates\nwill disrupt the quantum fluctuations of the electromagnetic field. In particular,\nmetamaterials have a negative refractive index, so that electromagnetic light waves\nentering a metamaterial bend in the opposite way than expected, says Leonhardt.That will\ncause the Casimir force to act in the opposite direction – forcing the upper plate to levitate.\nThe work will appear in the New Journal of Physics.\nFederico Capasso, an expert on the Casimir effect at Harvard University in Boston, is\nimpressed.’Using metamaterials to reverse the Casimir effect is a very clever idea,’ he\nsays.\nHowever, he points out that because metamaterials are difficult to engineer, it’s unlikely\nthat they could be used to levitate objects in the near future.\nBut there are good signs that quantum levitation could be achieved much sooner, by other\nmethods. Umar Mohideen at the University of California Riverside and his colleagues have\nsuccessfully manipulated the strength of the Casimir force by increasing the reflectivity of\none of the plates, so that it reflects virtual particles more efficiently. Modifying the strength\n \n1\n\nof the Casimir force is the first step towards reversing it, says team member Galina\nKlimchitskaya at North-West Technical University in St Petersburg, Russia.\nCapasso and his colleagues have also been working on an alternative scheme to harness\na repulsive Casimir effect Their calculations show that a repulsive Casimir force could be\nset up between a 42.7 micrometre-wide gold-coated polystyrene sphere and a silicon\ndioxide plate, if the two are immersed in ethanol. ‘Although the Casimir force between any\ntwo substances – the ethanol and gold, the gold and the silicon dioxide, or the silicon\ndioxide and the ethanol – is positive, the relative strengths of attraction are different, and\nwhen you combine the materials, you should see the gold sphere levitate,’ he says.\nCapasso’s early experiments suggest that such repulsion could occur, and that in turn\ncould be used to levitate one object above another.’It’s very early work, and we still need to\nmake certain this is really happening, but we are slowly building up experimental evidence\nfor quantum levitation,’says Capasso, who presented his results at a conference on\nCoherence and Quantum Optics in Rochester, New York, in June.\nThis is a very exciting experimental result because it is the first demonstration that we can\nengineer a repulsive Casimir force,’ says Leonhardt.\n \n2",
