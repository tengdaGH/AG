  "passage_text": "Reading Practice\n \nThe electric revolution\nYour next car may be electric. We look at the technologies that will bring the revolution.\nThe main reasons why electric cars are not more popular at present are their price and\ntheir relatively small range. Existing battery systems only allow electric cars to travel a\ndistance of between 100 and 160 km. However, this distance may not be a problem for\nurban drivers. A recent Sydney study reported that 20 percent of journeys were 30 km or\nless, and recent data from the US suggests that ?? percent of trips taken there are 48 km\nor less.\nAn innovative company called Better Place is aiming to make electric cars an option for all\ndrivers. It wants to see existing vehicles replaced by electric vehicles which, it says, offer a\nnumber of benefits. Firstly, they can be powered by renewable energy which produces zero\nemissions. What is more, electric motors are more efficient and can convert more than 90\npercent of power into movement, whereas the\nefficiency of diesel or petrol engines is less than 20 percent. To achieve its aim, Better\nPlace plans to use technology which is already available.\nThe plan is simple but revolutionary. It starts with the installation of a home charge point,\nand through this, the vehicle will be plugged into the electricity grid whenever it is in the\ngarage, typically at night. In the morning, with a fully charged battery, the car is capable of\nas much as 160 km in urban motoring conditions. In addition to the home charge point, the\nbattery can be topped up by charge points at work and at supermarkets.\nThe battery is linked to a control centre by smart technology inside the vehicle. Better Place\ncan then ensure that the car is charged with electricity from renewable sources at the\ncheapest price. For longer trips, a navigation system directs the driver to the nearest switch\nstation, where the depleted battery can be replaced with a charged one by a robot within a\ncouple of minutes.\n \n1",
