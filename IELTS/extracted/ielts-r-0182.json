The northern polar\nregions will be more than 6°C warmer, while the large continents – also the largest centres\nof population – will be 4°C or warmer. In contrast, the Southern Ocean, which surrounds\nNew Zealand, may warm by only 2°C. The sea will act as an air conditioner and in this\naspect, New Zealand’s location is comparatively fortunate.\nB\nAny predictions are complicated by the variability of New Zealand’s climate. The annual\ntemperature can fluctuate as much as 1°C above or below the long-term average. The\nearly summer of 2006-7, for instance, was notably cool, thanks in part to the iceberg that\ndrifted up the east coast. A few months later, warm water from the Tasman Sea helped\nmake May 2007 unusually hot. These variables will continue unaffected so that, although\nthe general pattern will be for rising temperatures, the warming trend may not be uniform.\nC\nThe Ocean to the south of New Zealand will have one important effect. As the world\nwarms, the great bank of west winds that circle Antarctica will become stronger. This has\nalready been observed, and its impact on New Zealand is likely to be profound, stronger,\nmore frequent west winds will bring increased, sometimes catastrophic rainfall to the west\ncoast of the country and create drier conditions in some eastern regions that are already\ndrought-prone. At the same time, the general warming will spread south.\nD\nFurthermore, in the drier regions, the average moisture deficit – that is, the difference\nbetween the amount of water in soils available to plants and the amount plants need for\noptimum growth – will increase. Soils could go into moisture deficit earlier in the growing\nseason and the deficits could last longer into autumn that at present. What we think of\ntoday as a medium-severity drought could be an almost annual occurrence by the end of\nthe century. One direct consequence of warmer – and shorter – winters will be a reduction\nin snow cover. The permanent snow line in the mountains will rise, while snow cover below\nthis will be shorter-lived. The amount of snow that falls may actually increase, however,\neven in some northern centres, owing to the intensification of precipitation, Ski-field base\nstation may eventually have to be moved upwards to be within reach of the new snow line\nbut there could still be plenty of the white stuff up there.\nE\nThere will also be a marked impact on New Zealand’s glaciers. Over the last 100 years, the\nglaciers have been reduced by 35%, although since 1978 increase snowfall has offset the\neffect of warming. The latest studies conducted by the National Institute for Water and\nAtmospheric. Research (NIWA), however, suggest that by the end of the century, warming\nover the Southern Alps could be significantly greater than over the rest of the country.\nF\n \n1\n\nSea levels around New Zealand have risen by 25cm since the middle of the 9th century\nand by 7 cm since 1990. Predictions for the coming years cover a wide range, however,\npartly because of unknown rises resulting from the melting of the ice in the Arctic,\nGreenland and Antarctica. In addition, sea level at any given time is affected by many\ndifferent factors, one of which is called storm surge. When a Coincides with a high tide\nalong low lying coastal areas, this bulge raises the tide higher than normal, creating. Surge\nnot unlike a slow-motion tsunami. Not only does a rise in sea level increase the potential for\nhis sort damage, but it also has less immediate impacts. The one potentially grave outcome\nis that groundwater systems may become contaminated with saltwater, spoiling them for\nthe irrigation of farmland, which in turn could diminish crop harvests. Similarly, over time,\nestuaries may be enlarged by erosion as tidal influences reach further upstream, altering\nthe contours of whole shorelines and initiating further unforeseen consequences.\nG\nThe impacts these changes will have on New Zealand are difficult to generalize. Human\nsystems are better able to adapt to change than natural ecosystems because humans can\nsee a problem coming and plan a response. Farmers and horticulturalists have made\nconsiderable advances, replacing crops they grow to better suit the new conditions.\nHowever, plant breeders will need to show considerable ingenuity if they can overcome the\nacute water shortages that are forecast.\nH\nFor natural ecosystems the rate of change is crucial. If it is low, the plants and animals and\nfish will be able to ‘keep up’; if it is high, only the most adaptable species-those that can\nsurvive in the widest range of ecological niches-are likely to survive. Species adapted to\nonly a narrow range of conditions or food sources will find adaptation much more difficult.\nTake tuatara, for instance. Their sex is determined by the temperature at which the eggs\nare incubated in warm (currently above 22 °C) condition become predominately male – and\nnow males already outnumber females by nearly two to one in some island refuges. In the\nmountains, as the permanent snow line moves upwards, the tolerance zones of some\nalpine plants and animals may simply disappear. It should also be remembered that global\nwarming is just that – a global phenomenon. ‘New Zealand’s own greenhouse emissions\nare tiny – around 0.5% of the global total. Even if New Zealanders were to achieve the\ngovernment’s target of carbon neutrality, this would have no discernable impact on global\nclimate change.\nI\n \nThe changes that global warming is going to bring to New Zealand during the 21st century\nare going to be significant, but where the country is likely to be most vulnerable is with\nrespect to climate change elsewhere. New Zealand may warm more slowly than most\nplaces, but if its major export markets undergo damaging change, the economic impact will\nbe severe.\n \n2",
