  "passage_text": "Reading Practice\n \nThe value of research into mite harvestmen\n \nFew people have heard of the mite harvestman, and fewer still would recognize it at close\nrange. The insect is a relative of the far more familiar daddy longlegs. But its legs are\nstubby rather than long, and its body is only as big as a sesame seed. To find mite\nharvestmen, scientists go to dark, humid forests and sift through the leaf litter. The animals\nrespond by turning motionless, making them impossible for even a trained eye to pick out.’\nThey look like grains of dirt.’ said Gonzalo Giribet, an invertebrate biologist at Harvard\nUniversity.\n \nDr Giribet and his colleagues have spent six years searching for mite harvestmen on five\ncontinents. The animals have an extraordinary story to tell they carry a record of hundreds\nof millions of years of geological history, chronicling the journeys that continents have\nmade around the Earth. The Earth’s landmasses have slowly collided and broken apart\nagain several times, carrying animals and plants with them. These species have provided\nclues to the continents’ paths.\n \nThe notion of continental drift originally came from such clues. In 1911, the German\nscientist Alfred Wegener was struck by the fact that fossils of similar animals and plants\ncould be found on either side of the Atlantic. The ocean was too big for the species to have\ntraveled across it on their own. Wegener speculated correctly, as it turned out that the\nsurrounding continents had originally been welded together in a single landmass, which he\ncalled Pangea.\n \nContinental drift, or plate tectonics as it is scientifically known, helped move species around\nthe world. Armadillos and their relatives are found in South America and Africa today\nbecause their ancestors evolved when the continents were joined. When South America\nand North America connected a few million years ago, armadillos spread north, too.\n \nBiogeographers can learn clues about continental drift by comparing related species.\nHowever, they must also recognize cases where species have spread for other reasons,\nsuch as by crossing great stretches of water. The island of Hawaii, for example, was home\nto a giant flightless goose that has become extinct. Studies on DNA extracted from its\nbones show that it evolved from the Canada goose. Having colonized Hawaii, it branched\noff from that species, losing its ability to fly. This evolution occurred half a million years ago,\nwhen geologists estimate that Hawaii emerged from the Pacific.\nWhen species jump around the planet, their histories blur. It is difficult to say much about\nwhere cockroaches evolved, for example, because they can move quickly from continent to\ncontinent. This process, known as dispersal, limits many studies. ‘Most of them tend to\nconcentrate on particular parts of the world.' Dr Giribet said. I wanted to find a new system\nfor studying biogeography on a global scale.\n \n1\n\n \n \nDr Giribet realized that mite harvestmen might be that system. The 5,000 or so mite\nharvestmen species can be found on every continent except Antarctica. Unlike creatures\nfound around the world like cockroaches, mite harvestmen cannot disperse well. The\ntypical harvestman species has a range of fewer than 50 miles. Harvestmen are not found\non young islands like Hawaii, as these types of islands emerged long after the break-up of\nPangea.\n \nAccording to Assistant Professor Sarah Boyer, a former student of Dr Giribet. ‘It’s really\nhard to find a group of species that is distributed all over the world but that also doesn’t\ndisperse very far.'\n \nWhat mite harvestmen lack in mobility, they make up in age. Their ancestors were among\nthe first land animals, and fossils of daddy longlegs have been found in 400 million-year-\nago rocks. Mite harvestmen evolved long before Pangea broke up and have been carried\nalong by continental drift ever since they’ve managed to get themselves around the world\nonly because they’ve been around for hundreds of millions of years, Dr Boyer said. Dr\nBoyer, Dr Giribet and their colleagues have gathered thousands of mite harvestmen from\naround the world, from which they extracted DNA. Variations in the genes helped the\nscientists build an evolutionary tree. By calculating how quickly the DNA mutated, the\nscientists could estimate when lineages branched off. They then compared the\nharvestmen's evolution to the movements of the continents. ‘The patterns are remarkably\nclear.’ Dr Boyer said.\n \n \nThe scientists found that they could trace mite harvestmen from their ancestors on Pangea.\nOne lineage includes species in Chile South Africa, Sri Lanka and other places separated\nby thousands of miles of ocean. But 150 million years ago, all those sites were in\nGondwana which was a region of Pangea.\n \nThe harvestmen preserve smaller patterns of continental drift, as well as bigger ones. After\nanalyzing the DNA of a Florida harvestman, Metasiro americanus, the scientists were\nsurprised to find that it was not related to other North American species. Its closet relatives\nlive in West Africa. Dr Boyer then began investigating the geological history of Florida and\nfound recent research to explain the mystery. Florida started out welded to West Africa\nnear Segenal. North America than collied into them Pangea was forming. About 170 million\nyears ago, North America ripped away from West Africa, taking Florida with it. The African\nancestors of Florida’s harvestmen came along the ride.\nDr Giribet now hopes to study dozens or even hundreds of species, to find clues about\nplate tectonics that a single animal could not show.\n \n2\n\nQUESTIONS 1-6\nChoose the correct letter A, B, C or D.\nWrite the correct letter in boxes 1-6 on your answer sheet.\n27.
