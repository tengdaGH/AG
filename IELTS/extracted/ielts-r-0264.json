The bristlecone pine (Pinus longaeva), of the White\nMountains in California, has served this purpose greater than any other species of tree on\nthe planet. Conditions here are brutal: scant precipitation and low average temperatures\nmean a short growing season, only intensified by ferocious wind and mal-nutritious rocky.\nNevertheless, bristlecone pines have claimed these barren slopes as their permanent\nhome. Evolving here in this harsh environment, super-adapted and without much\ncompetition, bristlecones have earned their seat on the longevity throne by becoming the\noldest living trees on the planet. Results of extensive studies on bristlecone pine stands\nhave shown that in fact such, environmental limitations are positively associated with the\nattainment of great age. This intriguing phenomenon will be discussed further on.\nB\nBut exactly how old is old? Sprouted before the invention of Egyptian hieroglyphs and long\nbefore the teachings of Jesus of Nazareth, Methuselah is the oldest bristlecone alive at\nroughly 4,700 years. Although specimens of this age do not represent the species’\naverage, there are 200 trees more than 3,000 years old, and two dozen more than 4,000.\nConsidering that these high ages are obtained in the face of such remarkable\nenvironmental adversity, the bristlecone pines have become the focus of much scientific\nexamination over the past half-century.\nC\nPerhaps most interested in the bristlecone pine are dendrochronologists or tree-ring daters.\nWith every strenuous year that passes in the While Mountains, each bristlecone grows and\nforms a new outer layer of cambium that reflects a season’s particular ease or hardship. So\nwhile growing seasons may expand or shrink, the trees carry on, their growth rings faithfully\nrecording the bad years alongside the goods. Through examining the annual growth rings\nof both living and dead specimens, taking thousands of core samples, and by processes of\ncross-dating between trees and other qualitative records, scientists have compiled a\ncontinuous tree-ring record that dates back to the last Ice Age between eight and ten\nthousand years ago. Among other linked accomplishments, this record has enhanced the\ndating process, helping to double-check and correct the radiocarbon-14 method to more\naccurately estimate the age of organic material.\nD\nNow more than ever the importance of monitoring the bristlecone is being realized. As our\nglobal climate continues to undergo its most recent and abrupt atmospheric change, these\nancient scribes continue to respond. Since, the rings of wood formed each year reveal the\ntrees’ response to climatic conditions during a particular growing season, in their\npersistence they have left us natural recordings of the past, markers of the present, and\nclues to the future.\n \n1\n\nE\nThe species’ name originates from the appearance of its unusual cones and needles. The\nbristlecone’s short, pale needles are also trademarks, bunching together to form foxtail-like\nbundles. As is the case of most conifer needles, these specialized leaves cluster together\nto shelter the stomata so very little moisture is lost through them. This adaptation helps the\nbristlecone photosynthesize during particularly brutal months. Saving the energy of\nconstant needle replacement and providing a stable supply of chlorophyll. For a plant trying\nto store so much energy, bristlecone seeds are relatively large in size. They are first\nreproduced when trees reach ages between thirty and seventy-five years old. Germination\nrates are generally high, in part because seeds require little to no initial stratification.\nPerhaps the most intriguing physical characteristic of a mature bristlecone, however, is its\nratio of living to deadwood on harsh sites and how this relates to old age. In older trees,\nhowever, especially in individuals over 1,500 years, a strip-bark trait is adaptive. This\ncondition occurs as a result of cambium dieback, which erodes and thereby exposes\ncertain areas of the bole, leaving only narrow bands of bark intact.\nF\nThe technique of cambial edge retreat has helped promote old age in bristlecone pine, but\nthat certainly is no the only reason. Most crucial to these trees’ longevity is their compact\nsize and slow rates of growth. By remaining in most cases under ten meters tall,\nbristlecones stay close to the limited water supply and can hence support more branches\nand photosynthesizing. Combined with the dry, windy, and often freezing mountain air,\nslow growth guarantees the bristlecones tight, fibrous rings with a high resin content and\nstructural strength. The absence of natural disaster has also safeguarded the bristlecone’s\nlengthy lifespan. Due to a lack of ground cover vegetation and an evenly spaced layout,\nbristlecone stands on the White Mountain peaks have been practically unaffected by the\nfire. This lack of vegetation also means a lack of competition for the bristlecones.\nG\nBristlecone pines restricted to numerous, rather isolated stands at higher altitudes in the\nsouthwestern United States. Stands occur from the Rocky Mountains, through the\nColorado Plateau, to the western margin of the Great Basin. Within this natural range, the\noldest and most widely researched stands of bristlecones occur in California’s the White\nMountains. Even just 200 miles away from the Pacific Ocean, the White Mountains are\nhome to one of this country’s few high-elevation deserts. Located in the extreme eastern\nrain shadow of the Sierra Nevada, this region receives only 12.54 inches of precipitation\nper year and experiences temperatures between -20F and +50F. The peaks south of the\nOwens Valley, are higher up than they might appear from a distance. Although most\nsummits exist somewhere around 11,000 feet, snow-capped White Mountain Peak, for\nwhich the range is named, stands at 14,246 feet above sea level. That said, to reach areas\nof a pure bristlecone is an intense journey all to itself.\nH\nWith seemingly endless areas of wonder and interest, the bristlecone pines have become\nsubject to much research over the past half-century. Since the annual growth of these\nancient organisms directly reflects the climatic conditions of a particular time period,\nbristlecones are of greatest significance to dendrochronologists or tree-ring specialists.\nDating any tree is simple and can be done within reasonable accuracy just by counting out\n \n2\n\nthe rings made each year by the plant’s natural means of growth. By carefully compiling a\nnearly 10,000-year-old bristlecone pine record, these patient scientists have accurately\ncorrected the carbon-14 dating method and estimated ages of past periods of global\nclimate change. What makes this record so special to dendrochronologists, too, is that,\nnowhere, throughout time, is precisely the same long-term sequence of wide and narrow\nrings repeated, because year-to-year variations in climate are never exactly the same.\nI\nHistorically the bristlecone’s remote location and gnarled wood have deterred commercial\nextraction, but nothing on earth will go unaffected by global warming. If temperatures rise\nby only 6 degrees F, which many experts say is likely this century, about two-thirds of the\nbristlecones’ ideal habitat in the White Mountains effectively will be gone. Almost 30,000\nacres of National Forest now preserves the ancient bristlecone, but paved roads,\ncampsites, and self-guided trails have led only to more human impact. In 1966, the U.S.F.S\nreported over 20,000 visitors to the Ancient Bristlecone Pine Forest, a figure which could\nexceed 40,000 today. Over the past hundreds of thousands of years, this species has\nendured in one of the earth’s most trying environments; they deserve our respect and\nreverence. As global climate change slowly alters their environment, we as humans must\ndo our part to raise awareness and lower our impact.\n \n3",
