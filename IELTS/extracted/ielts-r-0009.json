Linkages between the Agri-Food Sector and Tourism offer significant opportunities for\nthe development of both sectors within the region.

In 1990, agricultural\ntourism project members surveyed 290 visitors to the annual Monroe Cheese Festival and\n164 visitors to the Picnic on the Farm, a one-time event held in Platteville in conjunction\nwith the Chicago Bears summer training camp. More than one-half of those surveyed\nresponded favorably to a proposed tour, saying they would be interested in participating in\nsome type of agricultural tour in southwestern Wisconsin. Survey respondents reported that\nthey would prefer to visit cheese factories, sausage processing plants, dairy farms, and\nhistorical farm sites, as well as enjoy an old-fashioned picnic dinner. The study also found\nstrong interest in visiting specialty farms (strawberries, cranberries, poultry, etc.). More than\n75 percent of the Cheese Day visitors planned ahead for the trip, with 37 percent planning\nat least two months in advance.\nB. More than 40 percent of the visitors came to Monroe for two- or three-day visits. Many\nstopped at other communities on their way to Cheese Days. Visitors at both events\nindicated that they were there to enjoy themselves and were willing to spend money on\nfood and arts and crafts. They also wanted the opportunity to experience the “country”\nwhile there. The study found that planning around existing events should take into account\nwhat brought visitors to the area and provide additional attractions that will appeal to them.\nFor example, visitors to Cheese Days said they were on a holiday and appeared to be\nmore open to various tour proposals. Picnic visitors came specifically to see the Chicago\nBears practice. They showed less interest in a proposed agricultural tour than Cheese Day\nvisitors, but more interest in a picnic dinner.\nC. The study identified three primary audiences for agricultural tourism: 1) elderly people\nwho take bus tours to see the country; 2) families interested in tours that could be enjoyed\nby both parents and children; and 3) persons already involved in agriculture, including\ninternational visitors. Agricultural tourism can serve to educate urban tourists about the\nproblems and challenges facing farmers, says Andy Lewis, Grant county community\ndevelopment agent. While agriculture is vital to Wisconsin, more and more urban folk are\nbecoming isolated from the industry. In fact, Lewis notes, farmers are just as interested in\nthe educational aspects of agricultural tours as they are in any financial returns.\nD. “Farmers feel that urban consumers are out of touch with farming,” Lewis says. “If\ntourists can be educated on issues that concern farmers, those visits could lead to policies\nmore favorable to agriculture.” Animal rights and the environment are examples of two\nissues that concern both urban consumers and farmers. Farm tours could help consumers\nget the farmer’s perspective on these issues, Lewis notes. Several Wisconsin farms\nalready offer some type of learning experience for tourists. However, most agricultural\ntourism enterprises currently market their businesses independently, leading to a lack of a\nconcerted effort to promote agricultural tourism as an industry.\n \n1\n\n \nE. Lewis is conducting the study with Jean Murphy, assistant community development\nagent. Other participants include UW-Platteville Agricultural Economist Bob Acton, the\nCenter for Integrated Agricultural Systems, UW-Extension Recreation Resources Center,\nthe Wisconsin Rural Development Center, and Hidden Valleys, a Southwestern Wisconsin\nregional tourism organization. This past fall, Murphy organized several workshops with\nsome Green and Grant County farmers, local business leaders, and motor coach tour\noperators to discuss how best to organize and put on farm tours. Committees were formed\nto look at the following: tour site evaluations, inventory of the area’s resources, tour\nmarketing, and familiarization of tours. The fourth committee is organizing tours for people\nsuch as tour bus guides and local reporters to help better educate them about agricultural\ntourism. Green County farmers already have experience hosting visitors during the annual\nMonroe Cheese Days. Green county Tourism Director Larry Lindgren says these farmers\nare set to go ahead with more formal agricultural tours next year. The tours will combine a\nfarm visit with a visit to a local cheese factory and a picnic lunch.\nF. Another farm interested in hosting an organized tour is Sinsinawa, a 200-acre Grant\nCounty farm devoted to sustainable agriculture and run by the Dominican Sisters.\nEducation plays a major role at the farm, which has an orchard, dairy and beef cows, and\nhogs. Farm tours could be combined with other activities in the area such as trips to the\nMississippi River and/or visits to historical towns orlandmarks, Lewis says. The project will\nhelp expose farmers to the tourism industry and farm vacations as a way to possibly\nsupplement incomes, he adds. While farm families probably wouldn’t make a lot of money\nthrough farm tours, they would be compensated for their time, says Lewis. Farmers could\nearn additional income through the sale of farm products, crafts, and recreational activities.\n \n2",
