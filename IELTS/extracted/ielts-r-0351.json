But it is not. Scientists are now confident that rapid changes in\nthe Earth’s climate are already disrupting and altering many wildlife habitats. Pollution from\nvehicles is a big part of the problem.\nB\nThe United Nation’s Climate Change Panel has estimated that the global average\ntemperature rise expected by the year 2100 could be as much as 6°C, causing forest fires\nand dieback on land and coral bleaching in the ocean. Few species, if any, will be immune\nfrom the changes in temperature, rainfall and sea levels. The panel believes that if such\ncatastrophic temperature rises are to be avoided, the quantity of greenhouse gases,\nespecially carbon dioxide, being released into the atmosphere must be reduced. That will\ndepend on slowing the rate of deforestation and, more crucially, finding alternatives to coal,\noil and gas as our principal energy sources.\nC\nTechnologies do exist to reduce or eliminate carbon dioxide as a waste product of our\nenergy consumption. Wind power and solar power are both spreading fast, but what are we\ndoing about traffic? Electric cars are one possible option, but their range and the time it\ntakes to charge their batteries pose serious limitations. However, the technology that\nshows the most potential to make cars climate-friendly is fuel-cell technology. This was\nactually invented in the late nineteenth century, but because the world’s motor industry put\nits effort into developing the combustion engine, it was never refined for mass production.\nOne of the first prototype fuel-cell-powered vehicles have been built by the Ford Motor\nCompany. It is like a conventional car, only with better acceleration and a smoother ride.\nFord engineers expect to be able to produce a virtually silent vehicle in the future.\nD\nSo what’s the process involved – and is there a catch? Hydrogen goes into the fuel tank,\nproducing electricity. The only emission from the exhaust pipe is water. The fuel-cell is, in\nsome ways similar to a battery, but unlike a battery, it does not run down. As long as\nhydrogen and oxygen are supplied to the cell, it will keep on generating electricity. Some\ncells work off methane and a few use liquid fuels such as methanol, but fuel-ceils using\nhydrogen probably have the most potential. Furthermore, they need not be limited to\ntransport. Fuel-cells can be made in a huge range of size, small enough for portable\ncomputers or large enough for power stations. They have no moving parts and therefore\nneed no oil. They just need a supply of hydrogen. The big question, then, is where to get it\nfrom.\nE\nOne source of hydrogen is water. But to exploit the abundant resource, electricity is\n \n1\n\nneeded, and if the electricity is produced by a coal-fired power station or other fossil fuel,\nthen the overall carbon reduction benefit of the fuel-cell disappears. Renewable sources,\nsuch as wind and solar power, do not produce enough energy for it to be economically\nviable to use them in the ‘manufacture’ of hydrogen as a transport fuel. Another source of\nhydrogen is, however, available and could provide a supply pending the development of\nmore efficient and cheaper renewable energy technologies. By splitting natural gas\n(methane) into its constituent parts, hydrogen and carbon dioxide are produced. One way\nround the problem of what to do with the carbon dioxide could be to store it back below\nground – so-called geological sequestration. Oil companies, such as Norway’s Statoil, are\nexperimenting with storing carbon dioxide below ground in oil and gas wells.\nF\nWith freak weather conditions, arguably caused by global warming, frequently in the\nheadlines, the urgent need to get fuel-cell vehicles will be available in most showrooms.\nEven now, fuel-cell buses are operating in the US, while in Germany a courier company is\nplanning to take delivery of fuel-cell-powered vans in the near future. The fact that\ncentrally-run fleets of buses and vans are the first fuel-cell vehicles identifies another\nchallenge – fuel distribution. The refueling facilities necessary to top up hydrogen-powered\nvehicles are available only in a very few places at present. Public transport and delivery\nfirms are logical places to start since their vehicles are operated from central depots.\nG\nFuel-cell technology is being developed right across the automotive industry. This\ntechnology could have a major impact in slowing down climate change, but further\ninvestment is needed if the industry – and the world’s wildlife – is to have a long-term\nfuture.\n \n2",
