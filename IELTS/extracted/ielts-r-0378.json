  "passage_text": "Reading Practice\n \nRubik’s Cube - How the puzzle achieved success\nErno Rubik first studied sculpture and then later architecture in Budapest, where he went\non to become a teacher of interior design. It was while he was working as a teacher that he\nbegan the preliminary work on an invention that he called the ‘Magic Cube'.\nRubik was inspired by geometric puzzles such as the Chinese tangram, a puzzle consisting\nof various triangles, a square and a parallelogram which can be combined to create\ndifferent shapes and figures. However, unlike the tangram, which is two- dimensional,\nRubik was more interested in investigating how three-dimensional forms, such as the cube,\ncould be moved and combined to produce other forms.\nHis design consisted of a cube made up of layers of individual smaller cubes, and each\nsmaller cube could be turned in any direction except diagonally. To ensure that the cubes\ncould move independently, without falling apart, Rubik first attempted to join them together\nusing elastic bands. However, this proved to be impossible, so Rubik then solved the\nproblem by assembling them using a rounded interior. This permitted them to move\nsmoothly and easily. He experimented with different ways of marking the smaller cubes,\nbut ended up with the simple solution of giving a different colour to each side. The object\nwas to twist the layers of small cubes so that each side of the large cube was an identical\ncolour.\nRubik took out a patent for the Cube in 1977 and started manufacturing it in the same year.\nThe Cube came to the attention of a Hungarian businessman, Tibor Laczi, who then\ndemonstrated it at the Nuremberg Toy Fair. When British toy expert Tom Kremer saw it, he\nthought it was amazing and he persuaded a manufacturer, Ideal Toys, to produce 1 million\nof them in 1979. Ideal Toys renamed the Cube after the toy’s inventor, and in 1980, Rubik’s\nCube was shown at toy fairs all over the world. It won that year’s prize in Germany for Best\nPuzzle. Rubik’s Cube is believed to be the world’s best-selling puzzle; since its invention,\nmore than 300 million Cubes have been sold worldwide.\n \n1",
