To most of us, termites are destructive insects which can cause damage on a\ndevastating scale. But according to Dr Rupert Soar of Loughborough University’s School of\nMechanical and Manufacturing Engineering, these pests may serve a useful purpose for us\nafter all. His multi-disciplinary team of British and American engineers and biologists have\nset out to investigate the giant mounds built by termites in Namibia, in sub-Saharan Africa,\nas part of the most extensive study of these structures ever taken.\n \nB.  Termite mounds are impressive for their size alone; typically they are three metres high,\nand some as tall as eight metres by found. They also reach far into the earth, where the\ninsects ‘mine’ their building materials, carefully selecting each grain of sand they use. The\ntermite's nest is contained in the central cavity of the mound, safely protected from the\nharsh environment outside. The mound itself is formed of an intricate lattice of tunnels,\nwhich spilt into smaller and smaller tunnels, much like a person’s blood vessels.\n \nC. This complex system of tunnels draws in air from the outside, capturing wind energy to\ndrive it through the mound. It also serves to expel spent respiratory gases from the nest to\nprevent the termites from suffocating, so ensuring them a continuous provision of fresh,\nbreathable air. So detailed is the design that the nest stays within three degrees of a\nconstant temperature, despite variations on the outside of up to 50o C, from blistering heat\nin the daytime to below freezing on the coldest nights. The mound also automatically\nregulates moisture in the air, by means of best its underground ‘cellar’, and evaporation\nfrom the top of the mound. Some colonies even had ‘chimneys’ at a height of 20m to\ncontrol moisture less in the hottest regions of sub-Saharan Africa.\n \nD.  Furthermore, the termites have evolved in such a way as to outsource some of their\nbiological functions. Part of their digestive process in camera out by a fungus, which they\n‘farm’ inside the mound. This fungus, which is found nowhere else on earth, thrives in the\nconstant and optimum environment of the mound. The termites feed the fungus with slightly\nchewed wood pulp, which the fungus then breaks down into a digestible sugary food to\nprovide the insects with energy, and cellulose which they use for building. And, although\nthe termites must generate waste, none ever leaves the structure, indicating that there is\nalso some kind of internal waste-recycling system.\nE.  Scientists are so excited by the mounds that they have labelled them a ‘super organism’\nbecause, in Soar’s word. “They dance on the edge of what we would perceive to cool\ndown, or if you’re too cold you need to thrive: that’s called homeostasis.
