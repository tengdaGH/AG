  "passage_text": "Reading Practice\n \nBritish Architecture 2\nA. Architecture is about evolution, not revolution. It used to be thought that once the\nRomans pulled out of Britain in the fifth century, their elegant villas, carefully-planned towns\nand engineering marvels like Hadrian’s Wall simply fell into decay as British culture was\nplunged into the Dark Ages. It took the Norman Conquest of 1066 to bring back the light,\nand the  othic cathedral-builders of the Middle Ages played an important part in the revival\nof British culture. However, the truth is not as simple as that Romano-British culture – and\nthat included architecture along with language, religion, political organization and the arts –\nsurvived long after the Roman withdrawal. And although the Anglo- Saxons had a\nsophisticated building style of their own, little survives to bear witness to their achievements\nas the vast majority of Anglo-Saxon buildings were made of wood.\n \nB. Even so, the period between the Norman landing at Pevensey in 1066 and the day in\n1485 when Richard III lost his horse and his head at Bosworth, ushering in the Tudors and\nthe /Early Modern period, marks a rare flowering of British building. And it is all the more\nremarkable because the underlying ethos of medieval architecture was ‘fitness for\npurpose’. The great cathedrals and parish churches that lifted up their towers to heaven\nwere not only acts of devotion in stone; they were also fiercely functional buildings. Castles\nserved their particular purpose and their battlements and turrets were for use rather than\nornament. In a sense, the buildings of the 16th century were also governed by fitness for\npurpose – only now, the purpose was very different. In domestic architecture, in particular,\nbuildings were used to display status and wealth.\nC. This stately and curious workmanship showed itself in various ways. A greater sense of\nsecurity led to more outward-looking buildings, as opposed to the medieval arrangement\nwhere the need for defense created houses that faced inward onto a courtyard or series of\ncourtyards. This allowed for much more in the way of exterior ornament. The rooms\nthemselves tended to be bigger and lighter – as an expensive commodity, the use of great\nexpanses of glass was in itself a statement of wealth. There was also a general move\ntowards balanced and symmetrical exteriors with central entrances.\n \nD. With the exception of Inigo Jones (1573-1652), whose confident handling of classical\ndetail and proportion set him apart from all other architects of the period, most early 17th\ncentury buildings tended to take the innocent exuberance of late Tudor work one step\nfurther. /But during the 1640s and 50s the Civil War and its aftermath sent many gentlemen\nand nobles to the Continent either to escape the fighting or, when the war was lost, to\nfollow Charles II into exile. There they came into contact with French, Dutch and Italian\narchitecture and, with Charles’s restoration in 1660, there was a flurry of building activity as\nroyalists reclaimed their property and built themselves houses reflecting the latest\nEuropean trends. The British Baroque was a reassertion of authority, an expression of\nabsolutist ideology by men who remembered a world turned upside down during the Civil\nWar. The style is heavy and rich, sometimes overblown and melodramatic. The politics\nwhich underpin it are questionable, but its products are breathtaking.\nE. The huge glass-and-iron Crystal Palace, designed by Joseph Paxton to house the Great\nExhibition of 1851, shows another strand to 19th century architecture – one which\n \n1\n\nembraced new industrial processes. But it wasn’t long before even this confidence in\nprogress came to be regarded with suspicion. Mass production resulted in buildings and\nfurnishings that were too perfect, as the individual craftsman no longer had a major role in\ntheir creation. Railing against the dehumanising effects of industrialisation, reformers like\nJohn Ruskin and William Morris made a concerted effort to return to hand-crafted, pre-\nindustrial manufacturing techniques. Morris’s influence grew from the production of\nfurniture and textiles, until by the 1880s a generation of principled young architects was\nfollowing his call for good, honest construction.\n \nF. The most important trends in early 20th century architecture simply passed Britain by.\nWhilst Gropius was working on cold, hard expanses of glass, and Le Corbusier was\nexperimenting with the use of reinforced concrete frames, we had staid establishment\narchitects like Edwin Lutyens producing Neo-Georgian and Renaissance country houses\nfor an outmoded landed class. In addition there were slightly batty architect-craftsmen, the\nheirs of William Morris, still trying to turn the clock back to before the Industrial Revolution\nby making chairs and spurning new technology. Only a handful of Modern Movement\nbuildings of any real merit were produced here during the 1920s and 1930s, and most of\nthese were the work of foreign architects such as Serge Chermayeff, Berthold Lubetkin and\nErno Goldf inger who had settled in this country.\nG. After the Second World War the situation began to change. The Modern Movement’s\nbelief in progress and the future struck a chord with the mood of post-war Britain and, as\nreconstruction began under Attlee’s Labour government in 1945, there was a desperate\nneed for cheap housing which could be produced quickly. The use of prefabricated\nelements, metal frames, concrete cladding and the absence of decoration – all of which\nhad been embraced by Modernists abroad and viewed with suspicion by the British -were\nadopted to varying degrees for housing developments and schools. Local authorities,\ncharged with the task of rebuilding city center, became important patrons of architecture.\nThis represented a shift away from the private individuals who had dominated the\narchitectural scene for centuries.\nH. Since the War it has been corporate bodies like these local authorities, together with\nnational and multinational companies, and large educational institutions, which have\ndominated British architecture. By the late 1980s the Modern Movement, unfairly blamed\nfor the social experiments implicit in high- rise housing, had lost out to irony and spectacle\nin the shape of post-modernism, with its cheerful borrowings from anywhere and any\nperiod. But now, in the new Millennium, even post-modernism is showing signs of age.\nWhat comes next? Post-post-modernism?\n \n2",
