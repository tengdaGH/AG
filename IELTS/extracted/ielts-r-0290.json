  "passage_text": "Reading Practice\n \nMind readers\nIt may one day be possible to eavesdrop on another person’s inner voice. \nAs you begin to read this article and your eyes follow the words across the page, you may\nbe aware of a voice in your head silently muttering along. The very same thing happens\nwhen we write: a private, internal narrative shapes the words before we commit them to\ntext.\nWhat if it were possible to tap into this inner voice? Thinking of words does, after all. create\ncharacteristic electrical signals in our brains, and decoding them could make it possible to\npiece together someone’s thoughts. Such an ability would have phenomenal prospects, not\nleast for people unable to communicate as a result of brain damage. But it would also carry\nprofoundly worrisome implications for the future of privacy.\nThe first scribbled records of electrical activity in the human brain were made in 1924 by a\nGerman doctor called Hans Berger using his new invention - the electroencephalogram\n(EEG). This uses electrodes placed on the skull to read the output of the brain's billions of\nnerve cells or neurons. By the mid-1990s, the ability to translate the brain's activity into\nreadable signals had advanced so far that people could move computer cursors using only\nthe electrical fields created by their thoughts.\nThe electrical impulses such innovations tap into are produced in a part of the brain called\nthe motor cortex, which is responsible for muscle movement. To move a cursor on a\nscreen, you do not think 'move left’ in natural language. Instead, you imagine a specific\nmotion like hitting a ball with a tennis racket. Training the machine to realise which\nelectrical signals correspond to your imagined movements, however, is time consuming\nand difficult. And while this method works well for directing objects on a screen, its\ndrawbacks become apparent when you try using it to communicate. At best, you can use\nthe cursor to select letters displayed on an on-screen keyboard. Even a practised mind\nwould be lucky to write 15 words per minute with that approach. Speaking, we can manage\n150.\nMatching the speed at which we can think and talk would lead to devices that could\ninstantly translate the electrical signals of someone’s inner voice into sound produced by a\nspeech synthesiser. To do this, it is necessary to focus only on the signals coming from the\nbrain areas that govern speech. However, real mind reading requires some way to\nintercept those signals before they hit the motor cortex.\nThe translation of thoughts to language in the brain is an incredibly complex and largely\nmysterious process, but this much is known: before they end up in the motor cortex,\nthoughts destined to become spoken words pass through two ‘staging areas’ associated\nwith the perception and expression of speech.\nThe first is called Wernicke’s area, which deals with semantics - in this case, ideas based\nin meaning, which can include images, smells or emotional memories. Damage to\nWernicke’s area can result in the loss of semantic associations: words can’t make sense\nwhen they are decoupled from their meaning. Suffer a stroke in that region, for example,\nand you will have trouble understanding not just what others are telling you, but what you\nyourself are thinking.\n \n1\n\nThe second is called Broca’s area, agreed to be the brain’s speech-processing centre.\nHere, semantics are translated into phonetics and. ultimately, word components. From\nhere, the assembled sentences take a quick trip to the motor cortex, which activates the\nmuscles that will turn the desired words into speech.\nInjure Broca’s area, and though you might know what you want to say. you just can’t send\nthose impulses.\nWhen you listen to your inner voice, two things arc happening. You ‘hear’ yourself\nproducing language in Wernicke’s area as you construct it in Broca’s area. The key to mind\nreading seems to lie in these two areas.\n44 The work of Bradley Greger in 2010 broke new ground by marking the first-ever\nexcursion beyond the motor cortex into the brain’s language centres. His team used\nelectrodes placed inside the skull to detect the electrical signatures of whole words, such\nas 'yes’, ’no’, ’hot’, ‘cold’, 'thirsty', ‘hungry’, etc. Promising as it is. this approach requires a\nnew signal to be learned for each new word. English contains a quarter of a million distinct\nwords. And though this was the first instance of monitoring Wernicke’s area, it still relied\nlargely on the facial motor cortex.\nGreger decided there might be another way. The building blocks of language are called\nphonemes, and the English language has about 40 of them - the ‘kuh’ sound in ‘school’, for\nexample the ’$h' in ‘shy’. Every English word contains some subset of these components.\nDecode the brain signals that correspond to the phonemes, and you would have a system\nto unlock any word at the moment someone thinks it.\nIn 2011, Eric Leuthardt and his colleague Gerwin Schalk positioned electrodes over the\nlanguage regions of four fully conscious people and were able to detect the phonemes ’oo’,\n‘ah’, ‘eh’ and ‘ee’. What they also discovered was that spoken phonemes activated both the\nlanguage areas and the motor cortex, while imagined speech - that inner voice - boosted\nthe activity of neurons in Wernike’s area. Leuthardt had effectively read his subjects' minds.\n‘I would call it brain reading,’ he says. To arrive at whole words. Leuthardt’s next step is to\nexpand his library of sounds and to find out how the production of phonemes translates\nacross different languages.\nFor now. the research is primarily aimed at improving the lives of people with locked-in\nsyndrome, but the ability to explore the brain’s language centres could revolutionise other\nfields. The consequences of these findings could ripple out to more general audiences who\nmight like to use extreme hands-free mobile communication technologies that can be\nmanipulated by inner voice alone. For linguists, it could provide previously unobtainable\ninsight into the neural origins and structures of language. Knowing what someone is\nthinking without needing words at all would be functionally indistinguishable from telepathy.\n \n2",
