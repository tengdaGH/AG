  "passage_text": "Reading Practice\n \nHave teenagers always existed\nOur ancestor, Homo erectus, may not have had culture or even language, but did they\nhave teenagers? That question has been contested in the past few years, with some\nanthropologists claiming evidence of an adolescent phase in human fossil.This is not\nmerely an academic debate. Humans today are the only animals on Earth to have a\nteenage phase, yet we have very little idea why. Establishing exactly when adolescence\nfirst evolved and finding out what sorts of changes in our bodies and lifestyles it was\nassociated with could help us understand its purpose.Why do we, uniquely, have a growth\nspurt so late in life?\nUntil recently, the dominant explanation was that physical growth is delayed by our need to\ngrow large brains and to learn all the behaviour patterns associated with humanity –\nspeaking, social interaction and so on. While such behaviour is still developing, humans\ncannot easily fend for themselves, so it is best to stay small and look youthful.That way\nyour parents and other members of the social group are motivated to continue looking after\nyou.What’s more, studies of mammals show a strong relationship between brain size and\nthe rate of development, with larger-brained animals taking longer to reach adulthood.\nHumans are at the far end of this spectrum. If this theory is correct, and the development of\nlarge brains accounts for the teenage growth spurt, the origin of adolescence should have\nbeen with the evolution of our own species (Homo sapiens) and Neanderthals, starting\nalmost 200,000 years ago. The trouble is, some of the fossil evidence seems to tell a\ndifferent story.\nThe human fossil record is extremely sparse, and the number of fossilised children\nminuscule. Nevertheless, in the past few years anthropologists have begun to look at what\ncan be learned of the lives of our ancestors from these youngsters. One of the most\nstudied is the famous Turkana boy, an almost complete skeleton of Homo erectus from 1.6\nmillion years ago found in Kenya in 1984. Accurately assessing how old someone is from\ntheir skeleton is a tricky business. Even with a modern human, you can only make a rough\nestimate based on the developmental stage of teeth and bones and the skeleton’s general\nsize.\nYou need as many developmental markers as possible to get an estimate of\nage.TheTurkana boy’s teeth made him 10 or II years old.The features of his skeleton put\nhim at 13, but he was as tall as a modern 15-year-old. Susan Anton of New York University\npoints to research by Margaret Clegg who studied a collection of 18th- and 19th-century\nskeletons whose ages at death were known. When she tried to age the skeletons without\nchecking the records, she found similar discrepancies to those of the Turkana boy. One 10-\nyear-old boy, for example, had a dental age of 9, the skeleton of a 6-year-old but was tall\nenough to be 11. The Turkana kid still has a rounded skull, and needs more growth to\nreach the adult shape,’ Anton adds. She thinks that Homo erectus had already developed\nmodern human patterns of growth, with a late, if not quite so extreme, adolescent spurt.\nShe believes Turkana boy was just about to enter it.\nIf Anton is right, that theory contradicts the orthodox idea linking late growth with\ndevelopment of a large brain. Anthropologist Steven Leigh from the University of Illinois\ngoes further. He believes the idea of adolescence as catch-up growth does not explain why\n \n1\n\nthe growth rate increases so dramatically. He says that many apes have growth spurts in\nparticular body regions that are associated with reaching maturity, and this makes sense\nbecause by timing the short but crucial spells of maturation to coincide with the seasons\nwhen food is plentiful, they minimise the risk of being without adequate food supplies while\ngrowing. What makes humans unique is that the whole skeleton is involved. For Leigh, this\nis the key.\nAccording to his theory, adolescence evolved as an integral part of efficient upright\nlocomotion, as well as to accommodate more complex brains. Fossil evidence suggests\nthat our ancestors first walked on two legs six million years ago. If proficient walking was\nimportant for survival, perhaps the teenage growth spurt has very ancient origins. While\nmany anthropologists will consider Leigh’s theory a step too far, he is not the only one with\nnew ideas about the evolution of teenagers.\nAnother approach, which has produced a surprising result, relies on the minute analysis of\ntooth growth. Every nine days or so the growing teeth of both apes and humans acquire\nridges on their enamel surface.These are like rings in a tree trunk: the number of them tells\nyou how long the crown of a tooth took to form. Across mammals, the rate at which teeth\ndevelop is closely related to how fast the brain grows and the age you mature. Teeth are\ngood indicators of life history because their growth is less related to the environment and\nnutrition than is the growth of the skeleton.\nA more decisive piece of evidence came last year, when researchers in France and Spain\npublished their findings from a study of Neanderthal teeth. Neanderthals had much fester\ntooth growth than Homo erectus who went before them, and hence, possibly, a shorter\nchildhood. Lead researcher Fernando Ramirez-Rozzi thinks Neanderthals died young –\nabout 25 years old — primarily because of the cold, harsh environment they had to endure\nin glacial Europe.They evolved to grow up quicker than their immediate ancestors.\nNeanderthals and Homo erectus probably had to reach adulthood fairly quickly, without\ndelaying for an adolescent growth spurt So it still looks as though we are the original\nteenagers.\n \n2",
