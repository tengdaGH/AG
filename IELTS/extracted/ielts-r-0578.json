  "passage_text": "Reading Practice\n \nThis Marvellous Invention\nA\nOf all mankinds manifold creations, language must take pride of place. Other inventions -\nthe wheel, agriculture, sliced bread - may have transformed our material existence, but the\nadvent of language is what made us human. Compared to language, all other inventions\npale in significance, since everything we have ever achieved depends on language and\noriginates from it. Without language, we could never have embarked on our ascent to\nunparalleled power over all other animals, and even over nature itself.\nB\nBut language is foremost not just because it came first. In its own right it is a tool\nof extraordinary sophistication, yet based on an idea of ingenious simplicity: ‘this\nmarvellous invention of composing out of twenty-five or thirty sounds that infinite variety\nof expressions which, whilst having in themselves no likeness to what is in our mind,\nallow us to disclose to others its whole secret, and to make known to those who cannot\npenetrate it all that we imagine, and all the various stirrings of our soul’ This was how, in\n1660, the renowned French grammarians of the Port-Royal abbey near Versailles distilled\nthe essence of language, and no one since has celebrated more eloquently the magnitude\nof its achievement. Even so, there is just one flaw in all these hymns of praise, for the\nhomage to languages unique accomplishment conceals a simple yet critical incongruity.\nLanguage is mankind s greatest invention - except, of course, that it was never invented.\nThis apparent paradox is at the core of our fascination with language, and it holds many of\nits secrets.\nC\nLanguage often seems so skillfully drafted that one can hardly imagine it as anything other\nthan the perfected handiwork of a master craftsman. How else could this instrument make\nso much out of barely three dozen measly morsels of sound? In themselves,\nthese configurations of mouth p,f,b,v,t,d,k,g,sh,a,e  and so on - amount to nothing more\nthan a few haphazard spits and splutters, random noises with no meaning, no ability to\nexpress, no power to explain. But run them through the cogs and wheels of the language\nmachine, let it arrange them in some very special orders, and there is nothing that these\nmeaningless streams of air cannot do: from sighing the interminable boredom of existence\nto unravelling the fundamental order of the universe.\nD\nthe most extraordinary thing about language, however, is that one doesn’t have to be\na genius to set its wheels in motion. The language machine allows just about everybody\nfrom pre-modern foragers in the subtropical savannah, to post-modern philosophers in\nthe suburban sprawl - to tie these meaningless sounds together into an infinite variety of\nsubtle senses, and all apparently without the slightest exertion. Yet it is precisely this\ndeceptive ease which makes language a victim of its own success, since in everyday life its\ntriumphs are usually taken for granted. The wheels of language run so smoothly that one\nrarely bothers to stop and think about all the resourcefulness and expertise that must have\ngone into making it tick. Language conceals art.\n \n1\n\nE\nOften, it is only the estrangement of foreign tongues, with their many exotic and\noutlandish features, that brings home the wonder of languages design. One of the showiest\nstunts that some languages can pull off is an ability to build up words of breath-breaking\nlength, and thus express in one word what English takes a whole sentence to say. The\nTurkish word çehirliliçtiremediklerimizdensiniz, to take one example, means nothing less\nthan ‘you are one of those whom we can’t turn into a town-dweller’. (In case you were\nwondering, this monstrosity really is one word, not merely many different words squashed\ntogether - most ol its components cannot even stand up on their own.)\nF\nAnd if that sounds like some one-off freak, then consider Sumerian, the language\nspoken on the banks of the Euphrates some 5,000 years ago by the people who invented\nwriting and thus enabled the documentation of history. A Sumerian word like munintuma'a\n(‘when he had made it suitable for her’) might seem rather trim compared to the Turkish\ncolossus above. What is so impressive about it, however, is not its lengthiness but rather\nthe reverse - the thrifty compactness of its construction. The word is made up of different\nslots, each corresponding to a particular portion of meaning. This sleek design allows\nsingle sounds to convey useful information, and in fact even the absence of a sound has\nbeen enlisted to express something specific. If you were to ask which bit in the Sumerian\nword corresponds to the pronoun ‘it’ in the English translation ‘when he had made it\nsuitable for her’, then the answer would have to be nothing. Mind you, a very particular kind\nof nothing: the nothing that stands in the empty slot in the middle. The technology is so\nfine-tuned then that even a non-sound, when carefully placed in a particular position, has\nbeen invested with a specific function. Who could possibly have come up with such a nifty\ncontraption?\n \n2",
