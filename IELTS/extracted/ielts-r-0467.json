  "passage_text": "Reading Practice\n \n \nThe Ecological Importance of Bees\n \nA Sometime in the early Cretaceous period of the Earth's history, hunting wasps of a\ncertain type became bees by adopting a vegetarian diet: they began to rely more and more\non the pollen of plants as a source of protein for themselves and their offspring, as an\nalternative to insects. In so doing, they accidentally transported pollen on their bodies to\nother plants of the same species, bringing about pollination. The stage was thus set for a\nsuccession of ever-closer mutual adaptations of bees and flowering plants. In particular,\nflowers began to reward bees for their unwitting role in their reproduction by providing\nricher sources of pollen and another source of nutrition, nectar.\n \nB Today about 15 per cent of our diet consists of crops which are pollinated by bees. The\nmeat and other animal products we consume are ultimately derived from bee- pollinated\nforage crops, and account for another 15 per cent. It follows that around one third of our\nfood is directly or indirectly dependent on the pollinating services of bees. On a global\nbasis, the annual value of agricultural crops dependent on the pollination services of bees\nis estimated at £1,000 million (US$1,590 million). Much of this pollination is due to honey\nbees, and in monetary terms it exceeds the value of the annual honey crop by a factor of\nfifty.\n \n \n \nC But the apparently harmonious relationship between bees and plants conceals a conflict\nof interests. Although flowers need bees and vice versa, it pays each partner to minimise\nits costs and maximise its profits. This may sound like an extreme case of attributing\nhuman qualities to non-human species, but using the marketplace and the principles of\ndouble-entry book keeping as metaphors may give US some insights into what is really\ngoing on between bees and flowering plants. In the real world, both flower and bee operate\nin a competitive marketplace. A community of retailers, the flowers, seek to attract more or\nless discriminating consumers, the bees. Each flower has to juggle the costs and benefits\nof investing in advertising, by colour and scent, and providing rewards, nectar and pollen,\nclearly a species which depends on cross-pollination is on a knife-edge: it must provide\nsufficient nectar to attract the interest of a bee, but not enough to satisfy all of its needs in\none visit. A satiated bee would return to its nest rather than visit another flower. The bee,\non the other hand, is out to get the maximum amount of pollen and nectar. It must assess\nthe quality and quantity of rewards which are on offer and juggle its energy costs so that it\nmakes a calorific profit on each foraging trip. The apparent harmony between plants and\nbees is therefore not all that it seems. Instead, it is an equilibrium based on compromises\nbetween the competing interests of the protagonists.\n \nD This sounds remarkably like the ideas of the 18th-century economist Adam Smith. In his\nbook, The Wealth of Nations, Smith postulated that in human society the competitive\ninteractions of different ‘economic units' eventually resulted in a balanced, or ‘harmonious’\nsociety. One might predict, therefore, that economists would find the relationships between\nbees and plants of some interest. This is the case in Israel, where economists are\ncollaborating with botanists and entomologists in a long-term study of the pollination\nbiology of the native flora, in an attempt to understand the dynamics of the relationship\nbetween communities of bees and plants.\nE This sort of study is of more than passing academic interest. It is important that\nauthorities understand the dynamic relationships between plants and their pollinators. This\n \n1\n\n \nis especially true when, say, devising conservation policies. A good example comes from\nthe forests of tropical South America. Here, as in all rainforests, there is a high diversity of\ntree species. There may be more than 120 per acre, but in a given acre there may only be\none or two individuals of any one species: These trees are pollinated by large, fast-flying\nbees. There is evidence that certain types of bees learn the distribution of these scattered\ntrees and forage regularly along the same routes. This is called ‘trap-lining’ and the bees\nforage for up to 23 km from their nests. The bees are therefore acting as long distance\npollinators.\n \nF An issue of current concern in tropical forest conservation is that of trying to estimate the\nminimum sustainable size of islands' of forest reserve in areas where large-scale felling is\ntaking place. There is much discussion on seed dispersal distances. But this is only one\nhalf of the equation, so far as the reproduction of trees is concerned. There is another\nquestion that must be addressed in order to calculate whether proposed forest reserves are\nclose enough to the nearest large tract of forest: ‘what is the flight range of these long-\ndistance foragers?' We need to know much more about bees and their relationships with\nplants before this question can be answered.\nG Bees, then, are vital to our survival. Furthermore, much of the visual impact of human\nenvironments derives from vegetation, and most vegetation is dependent on bees for\npollination. Thus, as pollinators of crops and natural vegetation, bees occupy key positions\nin the web of relationships which sustain the living architecture of our planet.\n \n2",
