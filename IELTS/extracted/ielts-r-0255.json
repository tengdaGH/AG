  "passage_text": "Reading Practice\n \nLess Television, Less Violence and Aggression\nCutting back on television, videos, and video games reduces acts of aggression among\nschoolchildren, according to a study by Dr. Thomas Robinson and others from the Stanford\nUniversity School of Medicine. The study, published in the January 2001 issue of the\nArchives of Pediatric and Adolescent Medicine, found that third- and fourth-grade students\nwho took part in a curriculum to reduce their TV, video, and video game use engaged in\nfewer acts of verbal and physical aggression than their peers. The study took place in two\nsimilar San Jose, California, elementary schools. Students in one school underwent an 18-\nlesson, 6-month program designed to limit their media usage, while the others did not. Both\ngroups of students had similar reports of aggressive behavior at the beginning of the study.\nAfter the six-month program, however, the two groups had very real differences. The\nstudents who cut back on their TV time engaged in six fewer acts of verbal aggression per\nhour and rated 2.4 percent fewer of their classmates as aggressive after the program.\nPhysical acts of violence, parental reports of aggressive behavior, and perceptions of a\nmean and scary world also decreased, but the authors suggest further study to solidify\nthese results.\nAlthough many studies have shown that children who watch a lot of TV are more likely to\nact violently, this report further verifies that television, videos, and video games actually\ncause the violent behavior, and it is among the first to evaluate a solution to the problem.\nTeachers at the intervention school included the program in their existing curriculum. Early\nlessons encouraged students to keep tract of and report on the time they spent watching\nTV or videos, or playing Video games, to motivate them to limit those activities on their\nown. The initial lessons were followed by TV-Turnoff, an organization that encourages less\nTV viewing. For ten days, students were challenged to go without television, videos, or\nvideo games. After that, teachers encouraged the students to stay within a media\nallowance of seven hours per week. Almost all students participated in the Turnoff, and\nmost stayed under their budget for the following weeks. Additional lessons encouraged\nchildren to use their time more selectively, and many of the final lessons had students\nthemselves advocate reducing screen activities.\n \nThis study is by no means the first to find a link between television and violence. Virtually\nall of 3,500 research studies on the subject in the past 40 years have shown the same\nrelationship, according to the American Academy of Pediatrics. Among the most\nnoteworthy studies is Dr. Leonard D. Eron’s, which found that exposure to television\nviolence in childhood is the strongest predictor of aggressive behavior later in life—stronger\neven than violent behavior as children. The more violent television the subjects watched at\nage eight, the more serious was their aggressive behavior even 22 years later. Another\nstudy by Dr. Brandon S. Centerwall found that murder rates climb after the introduction of\ntelevision. In the United States and Canada, murder rates doubled 10 to 15 years after the\nintroduction of television, after the first TV generation grew up.\nCenterwall tested this pattern in South Africa, where television broadcasts were banned\nuntil 1975. Murder rates in South Africa remained relatively steady from the mid-1940s\nthrough the mid- 1970s. By 1987, however, the murder rate had increased 130 percent\nfrom its 1974 level. The murder rates in the United States and Canada had leveled1 off in\nthe meantime. Centerwall's study implies that the medium of television, not just the content,\n \n1\n\npromotes violence and the current study by Dr. Robinson supports that conclusion. The\nTurnoff did not specifically target violent television, nor did the following allowance period.\nReducing television in general reduces aggressive behavior. Even television that is not\n“violent” is more violent than real life and may lead viewers to believe that violence is funny,\ninconsequential, and a viable solution to problems. Also, watching television of any content\nrobs us of the time to interact with real people. Watching too much TV may inhibit the skills\nand patience we need to get along with others without resorting to aggression. TV, as a\nmedium, promotes aggression and violence. The best solution is to turn it off.\n \n2",
