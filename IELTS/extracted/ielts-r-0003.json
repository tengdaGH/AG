  "passage_text": "Reading Practice\n \nA Chronicle of Timekeeping\nOur conception of time depends on the way we measure it\nA\nAccording to archaeological evidence, at least 5,000 years ago, and long before the advent\nof the Roman Empire, the Babylonians began to measure time, introducing calendars to\nco-ordinate communal activities, to plan the shipment of goods and, in particular,\nto regulate planting and harvesting. They based their calendars on three natural cycles:\nthe solar day, marked by the successive periods of light and darkness as the earth rotates\non its axis; the lunar month, following the phases of the moon as it orbits the earth; and the\nsolar year, defined by the changing seasons that accompany our planet's revolution around\nthe sun.\nB\nBefore the invention of artificial light, the moon had greater social impact. And, for those\nliving near the equator in particular, its waxing and waning was more conspicuous than the\npassing of the seasons. Hence, the calendars that were developed at the lower\nlatitudes were influenced more by the lunar cycle than by the solar year. In more northern\nclimes, however, where seasonal agriculture was practised, the solar year became more\ncrucial. As the Roman Empire expanded northward, it organised its activity chart for the\nmost part around the solar year.\nC\nCenturies before the Roman Empire, the Egyptians had formulated a municipal calendar\nhaving 12 months of 30 days, with five days added to approximate the solar year.\nEach period of ten days was marked by the appearance of special groups of stars called\ndecans. At the rise of the star Sirius just before sunrise, which occurred around the all-\nimportant annual flooding of the Nile, 12 decans could be seen spanning the heavens. The\ncosmic significance the Egyptians placed in the 12 decans led them to develop a system in\nwhich each interval of darkness (and later, each interval of daylight) was divided into a\ndozen equal parts. These periods became known as temporal hours because their duration\nvaried according to the changing length of days and nights with the passing of the\nseasons. Summer hours were long, winter ones short; only at the spring and autumn\nequinoxes were the hours of daylight and darkness equal. Temporal hours, which were first\nadopted by the Greeks and then the Romans, who disseminated them through Europe,\nremained in use for more than 2,500 years.\nD\nIn order to track temporal hours during the day, inventors created sundials, which indicate\ntime by the length or direction of the sun's shadow. The sundial's counterpart, the\nwater clock, was designed to measure temporal hours at night. One of the first water\nclocks was a basin with a small hole near the bottom through which the water dripped out.\nThe falling water level denoted the passing hour as it dipped below hour lines inscribed on\nthe inner surface. Although these devices performed satisfactorily around the\nMediterranean, they could not always be depended on in the cloudy and often freezing\nweather of northern Europe.\n \n1\n\nE\nThe advent of the mechanical clock meant that although it could be adjusted to maintain\ntemporal hours, it was naturally suited to keeping equal ones. With these, however,\narose the question of when to begin counting, and so, in the early 14th century, a number\nof systems evolved. The schemes that divided the day into 24 equal parts varied\naccording to the start of the count: Italian hours began at sunset, Babylonian hours at\nsunrise, astronomical hours at midday and 'great clock' hours, used for some large public\nclocks in Germany, at midnight. Eventually these were superseded by 'small clock', or\nFrench, hours, which split the day into two 12-hour periods commencing at midnight.\nF\nThe earliest recorded weight-driven mechanical clock was built in 1283 in Bedfordshire in\nEngland. The revolutionary aspect of this new timekeeper was neither the\ndescending weight that provided its motive force nor the gear wheels (which had been\naround for at least 1,300 years) that transferred the power; It was the part called the\nescapement. In the early 1400s came the invention of the coiled spring or fusee which\nmaintained constant force to the gear wheels of the timekeeper despite the changing\ntension of its mainspring. By the 16th century, a pendulum clock had been devised, but the\npendulum swung in a large arc and thus was not very efficient.\nG\nTo address this, a variation on the original escapement was invented in 1670, in England. It\nwas called the anchor escapement, which was a lever-based device shaped like a ship's\nanchor. The motion of a pendulum rocks this device so that it catches and then\nreleases each tooth of the escape wheel, in turn allowing it to turn a precise amount.\nUnlike the original form used in early pendulum clocks, the anchor escapement permitted\nthe pendulum to travel in a very small arc. Moreover, this invention allowed the use of a\nlong pendulum which could beat once a second and thus led to the development of a new\nfloorstanding case design, which became known as the grandfather clock.\nH\nToday, highly accurate timekeeping instruments set the beat for most electronic devices.\nNearly all computers contain a quartz-crystal clock to regulate their operation.\nMoreover, not only do time signals beamed down from Global Positioning System satellites\ncalibrate the functions of precision navigation equipment, they do so as well for mobile\nphones, instant stock-trading systems and nationwide power-distribution grids.
