  "passage_text": "Reading Practice\n \nPollution! In the Bay\nA\nPouring water into the sea sounds harmless enough. But in Florida Bay, a large and\nshallow section of the Gulf of Mexico that lies between the southern end of the Everglades\nand the Florida Keys, it is proving highly controversial. That is because researchers are\ndivided over whether it will help or hinder the plants and animals that live in the bay.\nB\nWhat is at risk is the future of the bay’s extensive beds of seagrasses. These grow on the\nbay’s muddy floor and act as nurseries for the larvae of shrimps, lobsters and fish – many\nof the important sport and commercial-fishing species. Also in danger is an impressive\nrange of coral reefs that run the length of the Florida Keys and form the third-largest barrier\nreef in the world. Since the 1980s, coral cover has dropped by 40%, and a third of the coral\nspecies have gone. This has had a damaging effect on the animals that depend on the\nreef, such as crabs, turtles and nearly 600 species of fish.\nC\nWhat is causing such ecological change is a matter of much debate. And the answer is of\nno small consequence. This is because the American government is planning to devote $8\nbillion over the next 30 years to revitalise the Everglades. Seasonal freshwater flows into\nthe Everglades are to be restored in order to improve the region’s health. But they will then\nrun off into the bay.\nD\nJoseph Zieman, a marine ecologist at the University of Virginia, thinks this is a good idea.\nHe believes that a lack of fresh water in the bay is its main problem. The blame, he says,\nlies with a century of drainage in the Everglades aimed at turning the marshes into\nfarmland and areas for development. This has caused the flow of fresh water into Florida\nBay to dwindle, making the water in the bay, overall, more saline. This, he argues, kills the\nseagrasses, and as these rots, nutrients are released that feed the microscopic plants and\nanimals that live in the water. This, he says, is why the bay’s once crystal-clear waters\noften resemble pea soup. And in a vicious circle, these turbid blooms block out sunlight,\ncausing more seagrasses to die and yet more turbidity.\nE\nBrian Lapointe, a marine scientist at the Harbour Branch Oceanographic Institution at Fort\nPierce in Florida, disagrees. He thinks seagrasses can tolerate much higher levels of\nsalinity than the bay actually displays. Furthermore, he notes that when freshwater flows\nthrough the Everglades were increased experimentally in the 1990s, it led to massive\nplankton blooms. Freshwater running off from well-fertilised farmlands, he says, caused a\nfivefold rise in nitrogen levels in the bay. This was like pouring fuel on a fire. The result was\nmass mortality of seagrasses because of increased turbidity from the plankton. Dr Lapointe\nadds that, because corals thrive only in waters where nutrient levels are low, restoring\nfreshwater rich in nitrogen will do more damage to the reef.\n \n1\n\nF\nIt is a plausible theory. The water flowing off crops that are grown on the750,000 acres of\nheavily fertilised farmland on the northern edge of the Everglades is rich in nitrogen, half of\nwhich ends up in the bay. But Bill Kruczynski, of America’s Environmental Protection\nAgency, is convinced that nitrogen from farmlands is not the chief problem. Some coral\nreefs well away from any nitrogen pollution are dying and, curiously, a few are thriving. Dr\nKruczynski thinks that increased nutrients arriving from local sewage discharges from the\nthousands of cesspits along the Florida Keys are part of the problem.\nG \nSuch claims and counterclaims make the impact of the restoration plan difficult to predict. If\nincreased salinity is the main problem, the bay’s ecology will benefit from the Everglades\nrestoration project. If, however, nitrogen is the problem, increasing the flow of freshwater\ncould mate matters much worse.\nH\nIf this second hypothesis proves correct, the cure is to remove nitrogen from farmland or\nsewage discharges, or perhaps both. Neither will be easy. Man-made wetlands, at present,\nbeing built to reduce phosphate runoff into the bay—also from fertilisers—would need an\nalgal culture (a sort of contained algal bloom) added to them to deal with discharges from\nfarmlands. That would be costly. So too would be the replacement of cesspits with proper\nsewerage—one estimate puts the cost at $650m. Either way, it is clear that when, on\nDecember 1st, 3,000 square miles of sea around the reef are designated as a “protective\nzone” by the deputy secretary of commerce, Sam Bodman, this will do nothing to protect\nthe reef from pollution.\nI\nSome argue, though, that there is a more fundamental flaw in the plans for the bay: the\nvery idea of returning it to a Utopian ideal before man wrought his damage. Nobody knows\nwhat Florida Bay was like before the 1950s when engineers cut the largest canals in the\nEverglades and took most of the water away. Dr Kruczynski suspects it was more like an\nestuary. The bay that many people wish to re-create could have been nothing more than a\nchanging phase in the bay’s history.\nJ\nThese arguments do not merely threaten to create ecological problems but economic ones\nas well. The economy of the Florida Keys depends on tourism—the local tourist industry\nhas an annual turnover of $2.5 billion. People come for fishing-boat trips, for manatee\nwatching, or for scuba diving and snorkeling to view the exotically coloured corals. If the\nplan to restore the Everglades makes problems in the bay and the reef worse, it could\nprove a very expensive mistake.\n \n2",
