Such deforestation\nhas long been driven by farmers desperate to earn a living or by loggers building new\nroads into pristine forest. But now new data appears to show that big, block clearings that\nreflect industrial deforestation have come to dominate, rather than these smaller-scale\nefforts that leave behind long, narrow swaths of cleared land. Geographer Ruth DeFries of\nColumbia University and her colleagues used satellite images to analyse tree-clearing in\ncountries ringing the tropics, representing 98 per cent of all remaining tropical forest.\nInstead of the usual ‘fish bone' signature of deforestation from small-scale operations,\nlarge, chunky blocks of cleared land reveal a new motive for cutting down woods.\nB\nIn fact, a statistical analysis of 41 countries showed that forest loss rates were most closely\nlinked with urban population growth and agricultural exports in the early part of the 21st\ncentury - even overall population growth was not as strong an influence. ‘In previous\ndecades, deforestation was associated with planned colonisation, resettlement schemes in\nlocal areas and farmers clearing land to grow food for subsistence,' DeFries says. ‘What\nwe’re seeing now is a shift from small-scale farmers driving deforestation to distant\ndemands from urban growth, agricultural trade and exports being more important drivers.’\nC\nIn other words, the increasing urbanisation of the developing world, as populations leave\nrural areas to concentrate in booming cities, is driving deforestation, rather than containing\nit. Coupled with this there is an ongoing increase in consumption in the developed world of\nproducts that have an impact on forests, whether furniture, shoe leather or chicken feed.\n‘One of the really striking characteristics of this century is urbanisation and rapid urban\ngrowth in the developing world,’ DeFries says, ‘People in cities need to eat.’ ‘There’s no\nsurprise there,’ observes Scott Poynton, executive director of the Tropical Forest Trust, a\nSwitzerland-based organisation that helps businesses implement and manage sustainable\nforestry in countries such as Brazil, Congo and Indonesia. ‘It’s not about people chopping\ndown trees. It's all the people in New York, Europe and elsewhere who want cheap\nproducts, primarily food.’\nD\nDearies argues that in order to help sustain this increasing urban and global demand,\nagricultural productivity will need to be increased on lands that have already been cleared.\nThis means that better crop varieties or better management techniques will need to be\nused on the many degraded and abandoned lands in the tropics. And the Tropical Forest\nTrust is building management systems to keep illegally harvested wood from ending up in,\nfor example, deck chairs, as well as expanding its efforts to look at how to reduce the\n \n1\n\n‘forest footprint’ of agricultural products such as palm oil. Poynton says, ‘The point is to give\nforests value as forests, to keep them as forests and give them a use as forests. They’re\nnot going to be locked away as national parks. That’s not going to happen.’\nE\nBut it is not all bad news. Halts in tropical deforestation have resulted in forest regrowth in\nsome areas where tropical lands were previously cleared. And forest clearing in the\nAmazon, the world’s largest tropical forest, dropped from roughly 1.9 million hectares a\nyear in the 1990s to 1.6 million hectares a year over the last decade, according to the\nBrazilian government. 'We know that deforestation has slowed down in at least the\nBrazilian Amazon,’ DeFries says. ‘Every place is different. Every country has its own\nparticular situation, circumstances and driving forces.’\nF\nRegardless of this, deforestation continues, and cutting down forests is one of the largest\nsources of greenhouse gas emissions from human activity - a double blow that both\neliminates a biological system to suck up C02 and creates a new source of greenhouse\ngases in the form of decaying plants. The United Nations Environment Programme\nestimates that slowing such deforestation could reduce some 50 billion metric tons of C02,\nor more than a year of global emissions. Indeed, international climate negotiations continue\nto attempt to set up a system to encourage this, known as the UN Development\nProgramme’s fund for reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation in\ndeveloping countries (REDD). If policies [like REDD] are to be effective, we need to\nunderstand what the driving forces are behind deforestation, DeFries argues. This is\nparticularly important in the light of new pressures that are on the horizon: the need to\nreduce our dependence on fossil fuels and find alternative power sources, particularly for\nprivate cars, is forcing governments to make products such as biofuels more readily\naccessible. This will only exacerbate the pressures on tropical forests.\nG\nBut millions of hectares of pristine forest remain to protect, according to this new analysis\nfrom Columbia University. Approximately 60 percent of the remaining tropical forests are in\ncountries or areas that currently have little agricultural trade or urban growth. The amount\nof forest area in places like central Africa, Guyana and Suriname, DeFries notes, is huge.\n‘There’s a lot of forest that has not yet faced these pressures.’\n \n2",
