  "passage_text": "Reading Practice\n \nThe Rufous Hare-Wallaby\nThe Rufous Hare-Wallaby is a species of Australian kangaroo, usually known by its\nAboriginal name, ‘mala’. At one time, there may have been as many as ten million of these\nlittle animals across the arid and semi-arid landscape of Australia, but their populations, like\nthose of so many other small endemic species, were devastated when cats and foxes were\nintroduced - indeed, during the 1950s it was thought that the mala was extinct. But in 1964,\na small colony was found 450 miles northwest of Alice Springs in the Tanami Desert. And\n12 years later, a second small colony was found nearby. Very extensive surveys were\nmade throughout historical mala range - but no other traces were found.\nThroughout the 1970s and 1980s, scientists from the Parks and Wildlife Commission of the\nNorthern Territory monitored these two populations. At first it seemed that they were\nholding their own. Then in late 1987, every one of the individuals of the second and smaller\nof the wild colonies was killed. From examination of the tracks in the sand, it seemed that\njust one single fox had been responsible. And then, in October 1991, a wild-fire destroyed\nthe entire area occupied by the remaining colony. Thus the mala was finally pronounced\nextinct in the wild.\nFortunately, ten years earlier, seven individuals had been captured, and had become the\nfounders of a captive breeding programme at the Arid Zone Research Institute in Alice\nSprings; and that group had thrived. Part of this success is due to the fact that the female\ncan breed when she is just five months old and can produce up to three young a year. Like\nother kangaroo species, the mother carries her young - known as a joey - in her pouch for\nabout 15 weeks, and she can have more than one joey at the same time.\nIn the early 1980s, there were enough mala in the captive population to make it feasible to\nstart a reintroduction programme. But first it was necessary to discuss this with the leaders\nof the Yapa people. Traditionally, the mala had been an important animal in their culture,\nwith strong medicinal powers for old people. It had also been an important food source, and\nthere were concerns that any mala returned to the wild would be killed for the pot. And so,\nin 1980, a group of key Yapa men was invited to visit the proposed reintroduction area. The\nskills and knowledge of the Yapa would play a significant and enduring role in this and all\nother mala projects.\nWith the help of the local Yapa, an electric fence was erected around 250 acres of suitable\nhabitat, about 300 miles'northwest of Alice Springs so that the mala could adapt while\nprotected from predators. By 1992, there were about 150 mala in their enclosure, which\nbecame known as the Mala Paddock. However, all attempts to reintroduce mala from the\npaddocks into the unfenced wild were unsuccessful, so in the end the reintroduction\nprogramme was abandoned. The team now faced a situation where mala could be bred,\nbut not released into the wild again.\nThus, in 1993, a Mala Recovery Team was established to boost mala numbers, and goals\nfor a new programme were set: the team concentrated on finding suitable predator-free or\npredator-controlled conservation sites within the mala’s known range. Finally, in March\n1999, twelve adult females, eight adult males, and eight joeys were transferred from the\nMala Paddock to Dryandra Woodland in Western Australia. Then, a few months later, a\nsecond group was transferred to Trimouille, an island off the coast of western Australia.\nFirst, it had been necessary to rid the island of rats and cats - a task that had taken two\n \n1\n\nyears of hard work.\nSix weeks after their release into this conservation site, a team returned to the island to find\nout how things were going. Each of the malas had been fitted with a radio collar that\ntransmits for about 14 months, after which it falls off. The team was able to locate 29 out of\nthe 30 transmitters - only one came from the collar of a mala that had died of unknown\ncauses. So far the recovery programme had gone even better than expected.\nToday, there are many signs suggesting that the mala population on the island is\ncontinuing to do well.\n \n2",
