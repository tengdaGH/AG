  "passage_text": "Reading Practice\n \nThe Lake Erie Canal\nBegun in 1817 and opened in its entirety in 1825, the Erie Canal is considered by some to\nbe the engineering marvel of the nineteenth century. When the federal government\nconcluded that the project was too ambitious to undertake, the State of New York took on\nthe task of carving 363 miles of canal through the wilderness, with nothing but the muscle\npower of men and horses.\nOnce derided as ‘Clinton’s Folly’ for the Governor who lent his vision and political muscle to\nthe project, the Erie Canal experienced unparalleled success almost overnight. The iconic\nwaterway established settlement patterns for most of the United States during the\nnineteenth century, made New York the financial capital of the world, provided a critical\nsupply line that helped the North win the Civil War, and precipitated a series of social and\neconomic changes throughout a young America.\nExplorers had long searched for a water route to the west. Throughout the eighteenth and\nnineteenth centuries, the lack of an efficient and safe transportation network kept\npopulations and trade largely confined to coastal areas. At the beginning of the nineteenth\ncentury, the Allegheny Mountains were the Western Frontier. The Northwest Territories that\nwould later become Illinois, Indiana, Michigan and Ohio were rich in timber, minerals, and\nfertile land for farming, but it took weeks to reach these things. Travellers were faced with\nrutted turnpike roads that baked to hardness in the summer sun. In the winter, the roads\ndissolved into mud.\nAn imprisoned flour merchant named Jesse Hawley envisioned a better way: a canal from\nBuffalo on the eastern shore of Lake Erie to Albany on the upper Hudson River, a distance\nof almost 400 miles. Long a proponent of efficient water transportation, Hawley had gone\nbankrupt trying to move his products to market. Hawley’s ideas caught the interest of\nAssemblyman Joshua Forman, who submitted the first state legislation related to the Erie\nCanal in 1808, calling for a series of surveys to be made examining the practicality of a\nwater route between Lake Erie and the Hudson River. In 1810, Thomas Eddy, and State\nSenator Jonas Platt, hoping to get plans for the canal moving forward, approached\ninfluential Senator De Witt Clinton, former mayor of New York City, to enlist his support.\nThough Clinton had been recruited to the canal effort by Eddy and Platt, he quickly became\none of the canal’s most active supporters and went on to successfully tie his very political\nfate to its success.\nOn April 15th, 1817, the New York State Legislature finally approved construction of the\nErie Canal. The Legislature authorised $7 million for construction of the 363-mile long\nwaterway, which was to be 40 feet wide and eighteen feet deep. Construction began on\nJuly 4th 1817 and took eight years.\nLike most canals, the Erie Canal depended on a lock system in order to compensate for\nchanges in water levels over distance. A lock is a section of canal or river that is closed off\nto control the water level, so that boats can be raised or lowered as they pass through it.\nLocks have two sets of sluice gates (top and bottom), which seal off and then open the\nentrances to the chamber, which is where a boat waits while the movement up or down\ntakes place. In addition, locks also have valves at the bottom of the sluice gates and it is by\nopening these valves that water is allowed into and out of the chamber to raise or lower the\nwater level, and hence the boat.\n \n1\n\nThe effect of the Erie Canal was both immediate and dramatic, and settlers poured west.\nThe explosion of trade prophesied by Governor Clinton began, spurred by freight rates\nfrom Buffalo to New York of $10 per ton by canal, compared with $100 per ton by road. In\n1829, there were 3,640 bushels of wheat transported down the canal from Buffalo. By\n1837, this figure had increased to 500,000 bushels and, four years later, it reached one\nmillion. In nine years, canal tolls more than recouped the entire cost of construction. Within\n15 years of the canal’s opening, New York was the busiest port in America, moving\ntonnages greater than Boston, Baltimore and New Orleans combined. Today, it can still be\nseen that every major city in New York State falls along the trade route established by the\nErie Canal and nearly 80 per cent of upstate New York’s inhabitants live within 25 miles of\nthe Erie Canal.\nThe completion of the Erie Canal spurred the first great westward movement of American\nsettlers, gave access to the resources west of the Appalachians and made New York the\npreeminent commercial city in the United States. At one time, more than 50,000 people\ndepended on the Erie Canal for their livelihood. From its inception, the Erie Canal helped\nform a whole new culture revolving around canal life. For those who travelled along the\ncanal in packet boats or passenger vessels, the canal was an exciting place. Gambling and\nentertainment were frequent pastimes, and often families would meet each year at the\nsame locations to share stories and adventures. Today, the canal has returned to its former\nglory and is filled with pleasure boats, fishermen, holidaymakers and cyclists riding the\nformer towpaths where mules once trod. The excitement of the past is alive and well.\n \n2",
