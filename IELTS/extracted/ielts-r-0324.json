  "passage_text": "Reading Practice\n \nOrganic Farming and chemical fertilisers\nA\n \nThe world’s population continues to climb. And despite the rise of high-tech agriculture, 800\nmillion people don’t get enough to eat. Clearly, it’s time to rethink the food we eat and\nwhere it comes from. Feeding 9 billion people will take more than the same old farming\npractices, especially if we want to do it without felling rainforests and planting every last\nscrap of prairie. Finding food for all those people will tax farmers’ – and researchers’ –\ningenuity to the limit. Yet already, precious aquifers that provide irrigation water for some of\nthe world’s most productive farmlands are drying up or filling with seawater, and arable\nland in China is eroding to create vast dust storms that redden sunsets as far away as\nNorth America. “Agriculture must become the solution to environmental problems in 50\nyears. If we don’t have systems that make the environment better – not just hold the fort-\nthen we’re in trouble,” says Kenneth Cassman, an agronomist at the University of\nNebraska at Lincoln. That view was echoed in January by the Curry report, a government\npanel that surveyed the future of farming and food in Britain. \nB\nIt’s easy to say agriculture has to do better, but what should this friendly farming of the\nfuture look like? Concerned consumers come up short at this point, facing what appears to\nbe an ever-widening ideological divide. In one corner are the techno-optimists who put their\nfaith in genetically modified crops, improved agrochemicals and computer-enhanced\nmachinery; in the other are advocates of organic farming, who reject artificial chemicals\nand embrace back-to-nature techniques such as composting. Both sides cite plausible\nscience to back their claims to the moral high ground, and both bring enough passion to the\ndebate for many people to come away thinking we’re faced with a stark choice between\ntwo mutually incompatible options.\nC\nNot so. If you take off the ideological blinkers and simply ask how the world can produce\nthe food it needs with the least environmental cost, a new middle way opens. The key is\nsustainability: whatever we do must not destroy the capital of soil and water we need to\nkeep on producing. Like today’s organic farming, the intelligent farming of the future should\npay much more attention to the health of its soil and the ecosystem it’s part of. But\nintelligent farming should also make shrewd and locally appropriate use of chemical\nfertilisers and pesticides. The most crucial ingredient in this new style of agriculture is not\nchemicals but information about what’s happening in each field and how to respond. Yet\nironically, this key element may be the most neglected today.\nD\nClearly, organic farming has all the warm, fuzzy sentiment on its side. An approach that\neschews synthetic chemicals surely runs no risk of poisoning land and water. And its\nemphasis on building up natural ecosystems seems to be good for everyone. Perhaps\nthese easy assumptions explain why sales of organic food across Europe are increasing by\nat least 50 per cent per year.\n \n1\n\nE\nGoing organic sounds idyllic – but it’s native, too. Organic agriculture has its own suite of\nenvironmental costs, which can be worse than those of conventional farming, especially if it\nwere to become the world norm. But more fundamentally, the organic versus-chemical\ndebate focuses on the wrong question. The issue isn’t what you put into a farm, but what\nyou get out of it, both in terms of crop yields and pollutants, and what condition the farm is\nin when you’re done.\nF\nTake chemical fertilisers, which deliver nitrogen, an essential plant nutrient, to crops along\nwith some phosphorus and potassium. It is a mantra of organic farming that these fertilisers\nare unwholesome, and plant nutrients must come from natural sources. But in fact, the\nmain environmental damage done by chemical fertilisers as opposed to any other kind is\nthrough greenhouse gases-carbon dioxide from the fossil fuels used in their synthesis and\nnitrogen oxides released by their degradation. Excess nitrogen from chemical fertilisers can\npollute groundwater, but so can excess nitrogen from organic manures.\nG\nOn the other hand, relying solely on chemical fertilisers to provide soil nutrients without\ndoing other things to build healthy soil is damaging. Organic farmers don’t use chemical\nfertilisers, so they are very good at building soil fertility by working crop residues and\nmanure into the soil, rotating grain with legumes that fix atmospheric nitrogen, and other\ntechniques.\nH\nThis generates vital soil nutrients and also creates a soil that is richer in organic matter, so\nit retains better and is hospitable to the crop’s roots and creatures such as earthworms that\nhelp maintain soil fertility. Such soil also holds water better and therefore make more\nefficient use of both rainfall and irrigation water. And organic matter ties up CO2 in the soil,\nhelping to offset emissions from burning fossil fuels and reduce global warming.\nI\nAdvocates of organic farming like to point out that fields managed in this way can produce\nyields just as high as fields juiced up with synthetic fertilisers. For example, Bill Liebhardt,\nresearch manager at the Rodale Institute in Kutztown, Pennsylvania, recently compiled the\nresults of such comparisons for corn, wheat, soybeans and tomatoes in the US and found\nthat the organic fields averaged between 94 and 100 per cent of the yields of nearby\nconventional crops.\nJ\nBut this optimistic picture tells only half the story. Farmers can’t grow such crops every year\nif they want to maintain or build soil nutrients without synthetic fertilisers. They need to\nalternate with soil-building crops such as pasture grasses and legumes such as alfalfa. So\nin the long term, the yield of staple grains such as wheat, rice and corn must go down. This\nis the biggest cost of organic farming. Vaclav Smil of the University of Manitoba in\nWinnipeg, Canada, estimates that if farmers worldwide gave up the 80 million tonnes of\nsynthetic fertiliser they now use each year, total grain production would fall by at least half.\n \n2\n\nEither farmers would have to double the amount of land they cultivate – at catastrophic cost\nto natural habitats – or billions of people would starve.\nK\nThat doesn’t mean farmers couldn’t get by with less fertiliser. Technologically advanced\nfarmers in wealthy countries, for instance, can now monitor their yields hectare by hectare,\nor even more finely, throughout a huge field. They can then target their fertiliser to the parts\nof the field where it will do the most good, instead of responding to average conditions. This\nincreases yield and decreases fertiliser use. Eventually, farmers may incorporate long-term\nweather forecasts into their planning as well, so that they can cut back on fertiliser use\nwhen the weather is likely to make harvests poor anyway, says Ron Olson, an agronomist\nwith Cargill Fertilizer in Tampa, Florida.\nL\nOrganic techniques certainly have their benefits, especially for poor farmers. But strict\n“organic agriculture”, which prohibits certain technologies and allows others, isn’t always\nbetter for the environment. Take herbicides, for example. These can leach into waterways\nand poison both wildlife and people. Just last month, researchers led by Tyrone Hayes at\nthe University of California at Berkeley found that even low concentrations of atrazine, the\nmost commonly used weedkiller in the US, can prevent frog tadpoles from developing\nproperly.\n \n3",
