  "passage_text": "Reading Practice\n \nTHE LITTLE ICE AGE\nA\nThis book will provide a detailed examination of the Little Ice Age and other climatic shifts,\nbut, before I embark on that, let me provide a historical context. We tend to think of climate\n- as opposed to weather - as something unchanging, yet humanity has been at the mercy\nof climate change for its entire existence, with at least eight glacial episodes in the past\n730,000 years. Our ancestors adapted to the universal but irregular global warming since\nthe end of the last great Ice Age, around 10,000 years ago, with dazzling opportunism.\nThey developed strategies for surviving harsh drought cycles, decades of heavy rainfall or\nunaccustomed cold; adopted agriculture and stock-raising, which revolutionised human life;\nand founded the world’s first pre-industrial civilisations in Egypt, Mesopotamia and the\nAmericas. But the price of sudden climate change, in famine, disease and suffering, was\noften high.\nB\nThe Little Ice Age lasted from roughly 1300 until the middle of the nineteenth century. Only\ntwo centuries ago, Europe experienced a cycle of bitterly cold winters; mountain glaciers in\nthe Swiss Alps were the lowest in recorded memory, and pack ice surrounded Iceland for\nmuch of the year. The climatic events of the Little Ice Age did more than help shape the\nmodern world. They are the deeply important context for the current unprecedented global\nwarming. The Little Ice Age was far from a deep freeze, however; rather an irregular\nseesaw of rapid climatic shifts, few lasting more than a quarter-century, driven by complex\nand still little understood interactions between the atmosphere and the ocean. The\nseesaw brought cycles of intensely cold winters and easterly winds, then switched\nabruptly to.years of heavy spring and early summer rains, mild winters, and frequent\nAtlantic storms, or to periods of droughts, light northeasterly winds, and summer\nheat waves.\nC\nReconstructing the climate changes of the past is extremely difficult, because systematic\nweather observations began only a few centuries ago, in Europe and North America.\nRecords from India and tropical Africa are even more recent. For the time before records\nbegan, we have only ‘proxy records’ reconstructed largely from tree rings and ice cores,\nsupplemented by a few incomplete written accounts. We now have hundreds of tree-ring\nrecords from throughout the northern hemisphere, and many from south of the equator,\ntoo, amplified with a growing body of temperature data from ice cores drilled in Antarctica,\nGreenland, the Peruvian Andes, and other locations. We are close to a knowledge of\nannual summer and winter temperature variations over much of the northern\nhemisphere going back 600 years.\nD\nThis book is a narrative history of climatic shifts during the past ten centuries, and some of\nthe ways in which people in Europe adapted to them. Part One describes the Medieval\nWarm Period, roughly 900 to 1200. During these three centuries, Norse voyagers from\nNorthern Europe explored northern seas, settled Greenland, and visited North America. It\n \n1\n\nwas not a time of uniform warmth, for then, as always since the Great Ice Age, there were\nconstant shifts in rainfall and temperature. Mean European temperatures were about the\nsame as today, perhaps slightly cooler.\nE\nIt is known that the Little Ice Age cooling began in Greenland and the Arctic in about 1200.\nAs the Arctic ice pack spread southward, Norse voyages to the west were rerouted into the\nopen Atlantic, then ended altogether. Storminess increased in the North Atlantic and North\nSea. Colder, much wetter weather descended on Europe between 1315 and 1319, when\nthousands perished in a continent-wide famine. By 1400, the weather had become\ndecidedly more unpredictable and stormier, with sudden shifts and lower temperatures that\nculminated in the cold decades of the late sixteenth century. Fish were a vital commodity in\ngrowing towns and cities, where food supplies were a constant concern. Dried cod\nand herring were already the staples of the European fish trade, but changes in\nwater temperatures forced fishing fleets to work further offshore. The Basques, Dutch, and\nEnglish developed the first offshore fishing boats adapted to a colder and stormier Atlantic.\nA gradual agricultural revolution in northern Europe stemmed from concerns over food\nsupplies at a time of rising populations. The revolution involved intensive commercial\nfarming and the growing of animal fodder on land not previously used for crops. The\nincreased productivity from farmland made some countries self-sufficient in grain and\nlivestock and offered effective protection against famine.\nF\nGlobal temperatures began to rise slowly after 1850, with the beginning of the Modern\nWarm Period. There was a vast migration from Europe by land-hungry farmers and others,\nto which the famine caused by the Irish potato blight contributed, to North America,\nAustralia, New Zealand, and southern Africa. Millions of hectares of forest and woodland\nfell before the newcomers’ axes between 1850 and 1890, as intensive European farming\nmethods expanded across the world. The unprecedented land clearance released vast\nquantities of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, triggering for the first time humanly\ncaused global warming. Temperatures climbed more rapidly in the twentieth century as the\nuse of fossil fuels proliferated and greenhouse gas levels continued to soar. The rise has\nbeen even steeper since the early 1980s. The Little Ice Age has given way to a new\nclimatic regime, marked by prolonged and steady warming. At the same time, extreme\nweather events like Category 5 hurricanes are becoming more frequent.\n \n2",
