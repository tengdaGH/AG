  "passage_text": "Reading Practice\n \nTravel Accounts\nA\nThere are many reasons why individuals have traveled beyond their own societies. Some\ntravelers may have simply desired to satisfy curiosity about the larger world. Until recent\ntimes, however, trade, business dealings, diplomacy, political administration, military\ncampaigns, exile, flight from persecution, migration, pilgrimage, missionary efforts, and the\nquest for economic or educational opportunities were more common inducements for\nforeign travel than was a mere curiosity. While the travelers’ accounts give much valuable\ninformation on these foreign lands and provide a window for the understanding of the local\ncultures and histories, they are also a mirror to the travelers themselves, for these accounts\nhelp them to have a better understanding of themselves.\nB\nRecords of foreign travel appeared soon after the invention of writing, and fragmentary\ntravel accounts appeared in both Mesopotamia and Egypt in ancient times. After the\nformation of large, imperial states in the classical world, travel accounts emerged as a\nprominent literary genre in many lands, and they held especially strong appeal for rulers\ndesiring useful knowledge about their realms. The Greek historian Herodotus reported on\nhis travels in Egypt and Anatolia in researching the history of the Persian wars. The\nChinese envoy Zhang Qian described much of central Asia as far west as Bactria (modern-\nday Afghanistan) on the basis of travels undertaken in the first century BC while searching\nfor allies for the Han dynasty. Hellenistic and Roman geographers such as Ptolemy,\nStrabo, and Pliny the Elder relied on their own travels through much of the Mediterranean\nworld as well as reports of other travelers to compile vast compendia of geographical\nknowledge.\nC\nDuring the postclassical era (about 500 to 1500 CE), trade and pilgrimage emerged as\nmajor incentives for travel to foreign lands. Muslim merchants sought trading opportunities\nthroughout much of the eastern hemisphere. They described lands, peoples, and\ncommercial products of the Indian Ocean basin from East Africa to Indonesia, and they\nsupplied the first written accounts of societies in sub-Saharan west Africa. While merchants\nset out in search of trade and profit, devout Muslims traveled as pilgrims to Mecca to make\ntheir hajj and visit the holy sites of Islam. Since the prophet Muhammad’s original\npilgrimage to Mecca, untold millions of Muslims have followed his example, and thousands\nof hajj accounts have related their experiences. One of the best known Muslim travelers,\nIbn Battuta, began his travels with the hajj but then went on to visit central Asia, India,\nChina, sub-Saharan Africa, and parts of Mediterranean Europe before returning finally to\nhis home in Morocco. East Asian travelers were not quite so prominent as Muslims during\nthe postclassical era, but they too followed many of the highways and sea lanes of the\neastern hemisphere. Chinese merchants frequently visited Southeast Asia and India,\noccasionally venturing even to east Africa, and devout East Asian Buddhists undertook\ndistant pilgrimages. Between the 5th and 9th centuries CE, hundreds and possibly even\nthousands of Chinese Buddhists traveled to India to study with Buddhist teachers, collect\nsacred texts, and visit holy sites. Written accounts recorded the experiences of many\npilgrims, such as Faxian, Xuanzang, and Yijing. Though not so numerous as the Chinese\n \n1\n\npilgrims, Buddhists from Japan, Korea, and other lands also ventured abroad in the\ninterests of spiritual enlightenment.\nD\nMedieval Europeans did not hit the roads in such large numbers as their Muslim and east\nAsian counterparts during the early part of the postclassical era, although gradually\nincreasing crowds of Christian pilgrims flowed to Jerusalem, Rome, Santiago de\nCompostela (in northern Spain), and other sites. After the 12th century, however,\nmerchants, pilgrims, and missionaries from medieval Europe traveled widely and left\nnumerous travel accounts, of which Marco Polo’s description of his travels and sojourn in\nChina is the best known. As they became familiar with the larger world of the eastern\nhemisphere – and the profitable commercial opportunities that it offered – European\npeoples worked to find new and more direct routes to Asian and African markets. Their\nefforts took them not only to all parts of the eastern hemisphere but eventually to the\nAmericas and Oceania as well.\nE\nIf Muslim and Chinese peoples dominated travel writing in postclassical times, European\nexplorers, conquerors, merchants, and missionaries took center stage during the early\nmodern era (about 1500 to 1800 CE). By no means did Muslim and Chinese travel come to\na halt in early modern times. But European peoples ventured to the distant corners of the\nglobe, and European printing presses churned out thousands of travel accounts that\ndescribed foreign lands and peoples for a reading public with an apparently insatiable\nappetite for news about the larger world. The volume of travel literature was so great that\nseveral editors, including Giambattista Ramusio, Richard Hakluyt, Theodore de Bry, and\nSamuel Purchas, assembled numerous travel accounts and made them available in\nenormous published collections.\nF\nDuring the 19th century, European travelers made their way to the interior regions of Africa\nand the Americas, generating a fresh round of travel writing as they did so. Meanwhile,\nEuropean colonial administrators devoted numerous writing to the societies of their colonial\nsubjects, particularly in Asian and African colonies they established. By midcentury,\nattention was flowing also in the other direction. Painfully aware of the military and\ntechnological prowess of European and Euro-American societies, Asian travelers, in\nparticular, visited Europe and the United States in hopes of discovering principles useful for\nthe reorganization of their own societies. Among the most prominent of these travelers who\nmade extensive use of their overseas observations and experiences in their own writing\nwere the Japanese reformer Fukuzawa Yukichi and the Chinese revolutionary Sun Yat-\nsen.\nG\nWith the development of inexpensive and reliable means of mass transport, the 20th\ncentury witnessed explosions both in the frequency of long-distance travel and in the\nvolume of travel writing. While a great deal of travel took place for reasons of business,\nadministration, diplomacy, pilgrimage, and missionary work, as in ages past, increasingly\neffective modes of mass transport made it possible for new kinds of travel to flourish. The\nmost distinctive of them was mass tourism, which emerged as a major form of consumption\n \n2\n\nfor individuals living in the world’s wealthy societies. Tourism enabled consumers to get\naway from home to see the sights in Rome, take a cruise through the Caribbean, walk the\nGreat Wall of China, visit some wineries in Bordeaux, or go on safari in Kenya. A peculiar\nvariant of the travel account arose to meet the needs of these tourists: the guidebook,\nwhich offered advice on food, lodging, shopping, local customs, and all the sights that\nvisitors should not miss seeing. Tourism has had a massive economic impact throughout\nthe world, but other new forms of travel have also had considerable influence in\ncontemporary times. Recent times have seen unprecedented waves of migration, for\nexample, and numerous migrants have sought to record their experiences and articulate\ntheir feelings about life in foreign lands. Recent times have also seen an unprecedented\ndevelopment of ethnic consciousness, and many are the intellectuals and writers in the\ndiaspora who have visited the homes of their ancestors to see how much of their forebears’\nvalues and cultural traditions they themselves have inherited. Particularly notable among\ntheir accounts are the memoirs of Malcolm X and Maya Angelou describing their visits to\nAfrica.\n \n3",
