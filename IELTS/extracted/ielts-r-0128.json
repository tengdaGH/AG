  "passage_text": "Reading Practice\n \nDetection of a meteorite Lake\nA\nAs the sun rose over picturesque Lake Bosumtwi, a team of Syracuse University\nresearchers prepared for another day of using state-of-the-art equipment to help bottom.\nNestled in the heart of Ghana, the lake holds an untapped reservoir of information that\ncould help scientists predict future climate changes by looking at evidence from the past.\nThis information will also improve the scientists’ understanding of the changes that occur in\na region struck by a massive meteorite.\nB\nThe project, led by earth sciences professor Christopher Scholz of the College of Arts and\nSciences and funded by the National Science Foundation (NSF), is the first large-scale\neffort to study Lake Bosumtwi, which formed 1.1 million years ago when a giant meteor\ncrashed into the Earth’s surface. The resulting crater is one of the largest and most well-\npreserved geologically young craters in the world, says Scholz, who is collaborating on the\nproject with researchers from the University of Arizona, the University of South Carolina,\nthe University of Rhode Island, and several Ghanaian institutions. “Our data should provide\ninformation about what happens when an impact hits hard, pre-Cambrian, crystalline rocks\nthat are a billion years old,” he says.\nC\nEqually important is the fact that the lake, which is about 8 kilometers in diameter, has no\nnatural outlet. The rim of the crater rises about 250 meters above the water’s surface.\nStreams flow into the lake, Scholz says, but the water leaves only by evaporation, or by\nseeping through the lake sediments. For the past million years, the lake has acted as a\ntropical rain gauge, filling and drying with changes in precipitation and the tropical climate.\nThe record of those changes is hidden in the sediment below the lake bottom. “The lake is\none of the best sites in the world for the study of tropical climate changes,” Scholz says.\n“The tropics are the heat engine for the Earth’s climate. To understand the global climate,\nwe need to have records of climate changes from many sites around the world, including\nthe tropics.”\nD\nBefore the researchers could explore the lake’s subsurface, they needed a boat with a\nlarge, working deck area that could carry eight tons of scientific equipment. The boat –\ndubbed R/V Kilindi – was built in Florida last year. It was constructed in modules that were\ndismantled, packed inside a shipping container, and reassembled over a 10-day period in\nlate November and early December 1999 in the rural village of Abono, Ghana. The\nresearch team then spent the next two weeks testing the boat and equipment before\nreturning to the United States for the holidays.\nE\nIn mid-January, five members of the team – Keely Brooks, an earth sciences graduate\nstudent; Peter Cattaneo, a research analyst; and Kiram Lezzar, a postdoctoral scholar, all\nfrom SU; James McGill, a geophysical field engineer; and Nick Peters, a Ph.D. student in\n \n1\n\ngeophysics from the University of Miami – returned to Abono to begin collecting data about\nthe lake’s subsurface using a technique called seismic reflection profiling. In this process, a\nhigh-pressure air gun is used to create small, pneumatic explosions in the water. The\nsound energy penetrates about 1,000 to 2,000 meters into the lake’s subsurface before\nbouncing back to the surface of the water.\nF\nThe reflected sound energy is detected by underwater microphones – called hydrophones\n– embedded in a 50-meter-long cable that is towed behind the boat as it crosses the lake in\na carefully designed grid pattern. On-board computers record the signals, and the resulting\ndata are then processed and analyzed in the laboratory. “The results will give us a good\nidea of the shape of the basin, how thick the layers of sediment are, and when and where\nthere were major changes in sediment accumulation,” Scholz says. “We are now\ndeveloping a three-dimensional perspective of the lake’s subsurface and the layers of\nsediment that have been laid down.”\nG\nTeam members spent about four weeks in Ghana collecting the data. They worked seven\ndays a week, arriving at the lake just after sunrise. On a good day, when everything went\nas planned, the team could collect data and be back at the dock by early afternoon. Except\nfor a few relatively minor adjustments, the equipment and the boat worked well. Problems\nthat arose were primarily non-scientific – tree stumps, fishing nets, cultural barriers, and\noccasional misunderstandings with local villagers.\nH\nLake Bosumtwi, the largest natural freshwater lake in the country, is sacred to the Ashanti\npeople, who believe their souls come to the lake to bid farewell to their god. The lake is\nalso the primary source of fish for the 26 surrounding villages. Conventional canoes and\nboats are forbidden. Fishermen travel on the lake by floating on traditional planks they\npropel with small paddles.
