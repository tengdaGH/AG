I have also bought myself decent second-hand\nclothes and shoes.\"\nDoreen Soko\n'We’ve had business experience. Now I'm confident to expand what we've been\ndoing.\nI've learnt cash management, and the way of keeping money so we save for re- :\ninvestment. Now business is a part of our lives. As well, we didn't know each other\nbefore - now we've made new friends.'\nFan Kaoma\n  \nParticipants in the Youth Skills Enterprise Initiative Program, Zambia\nIntroduction\nAlthough small-scale business training and credit programs have become more common\nthroughout the world, relatively little attention has been paid to the need to direct such\nopportunities to young people. Even less attention has been paid to children living on the\nstreet or in difficult circumstances.\n \nOver the past nine years, Street Kids International (S.K.I.) has been working with partner\norganisations in Africa, Latin America and India to support the economic lives of street\nchildren, The purpose of this paper is to share some of the lessons S.K.I. and our partners\nhave learned.\nBackground\n \nTypically, children do not end up on the streets due to a single cause, but to a combination\nof factors: a dearth of adequately funded schools, the demand for income at home, family\nbreakdown and violence. The street may be attractive to children as a place to find\nadventurous play and money. However, It is also a place where some children are\nexposed, with little or no protection, to exploitative employment, urban crime, and abuse.\nChildren who work on the streets are generally involved in unskilled, labour-intensive tasks\nwhich require long hours, such as shining shoes, carrying goods, guarding or washing cars,\nand informal trading. Some may also earn income through begging, or through theft and\n \n1\n\n \nother illegal activities. At the same time, there are street children who take pride In\nsupporting themselves and their families and who often enjoy their work. Many children\nmay choose entrepreneurship because it allows them a degree of independence, is less\nexploitative than many forms of paid employment, and is flexible enough to allow them to\nparticipate in other activities such as education and domestic tasks.\nStreet Business Partnerships\nS.K.I. has worked with partner organisations in Latin America, Africa and India to develop\ninnovative opportunities for street children to earn income.\n•The S.K.I. Bicycle Courier Service first started in the Sudan. Participants in this enterprise\nwere supplied with bicycles, which they used to deliver parcels and messages, and which\nthey were required to pay for gradually from their wages. A similar program was taken up in\nBangalore, India.\n \n•Another successful project, The Shoe Shine Collective, was a partnership program with\nthe Y.W.C.A. in the Dominican Republic. In this project, participants were lent money to\npurchase shoe shine boxes. They were also given a safe place to store their equipment,\nand facilities for individual savings plans.\n•The Youth Skills Enterprise Initiative in Zambia is a joint program with the Red Cross\nSociety and the Y.W.C.A. Street youths are supported to start their own small business\nthrough business training, life skills training and access to credit.\nLessons learned\nThe following lessons have emerged from the programs that S.K.I. and partner\norganisations have created.\n•Being an entrepreneur is not for everyone, nor for every street child. Ideally, potential\nparticipants will have been involved in the organisation's programs for at least six\nmonths, and trust and relationship building will have already been established.\n•The involvement of the participants has been essential to the development of relevant\nprograms. When children have had a major role in determining procedures, they are\nmore likely to abide by and enforce them.\n•It is critical for all loans to be linked to training programs that include the development\nof basic business and life skills.\n•There are tremendous advantages to involving parents or guardians in the program,\nwhere such relationships exist. Home visits allow staff the opportunity to know where\nthe participants live, and to understand more about each individual’s situation.\n•Small loans are provided initially for purchasing fixed assets such as bicycles, shoe\nshine kits and basic building materials for a market stall. As the entrepreneurs gain\nexperience, the enterprises can be gradually expanded and consideration can be given\nto increasing loan amounts, The loan amounts in S.K.I. programs have generally\nranged from US$30-$100.\n \n2\n\n \n•All S.K.I. programs have charged interest on the loans, primarily to get the\nentrepreneurs used to the concept of paying interest on borrowed money. Generally\nthe rates have been modest (lower than bank rates).\nConclusion\n \nThere is a need to recognise the importance of access to credit for impoverished young\npeople seeking to fulfil economic needs. The provision of small loans to support the\nentrepreneurial dreams and ambitions of youth can be an effective means to help them\nchange their lives. However, we believe that credit must be extended in association with\nother types of support that help participants develop critical life skills as well as productive\nbusinesses.\n \n3",
