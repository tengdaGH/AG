The baillies of\nQueenhithe and Billingsgate acted as customs officers. There were conservators, who\nwere responsible for maintaining the embankments and the weirs, and there were the\ngarthmen who worked in the fish garths (enclosures). Then there were galleymen and\nlightermen and shoutmen, called after the names of their boats, and there were hookers\nwho were named after the manner in which they caught their fish. The searcher patrolled\nthe Thames in search of illegal fish weirs, and the tideman worked on its banks and\nforeshores whenever the tide permitted him to do so.\n \nB All of these occupations persisted for many centuries, as did those jobs that\ndepended upon the trade of the river. Yet, it was not easy work for any of the\nworkers. They carried most goods upon their backs, since the rough surfaces of the\nquays and nearby streets were not suitable for wagons or large carts; the\nmerchandise characteristically arrived in barrels which could be rolled from the ship\nalong each quay. If the burden was too great to be carried by a single man, then the\ngoods were slung on poles resting on the shoulders of two men. It was a slow and\nexpensive method of business.\n \nC However, up to the eighteenth century, river work was seen in a generally\nfavourable light. For Langland, writing in the fourteenth century, the labourers\nworking on river merchandise were relatively prosperous. And the porters of the\nseventeenth and early eighteenth centuries were, if anything, aristocrats of labour,\nenjoying high status. However, in the years from the late eighteenth to the early\nnineteenth century, there was a marked change in attitude. This was in part because\nthe working river was within the region of the East End of London, which in this\nperiod acquired an unenviable reputation. By now, dockside labour was considered\nto be the most disreputable, and certainly the least desirable form of work.\n \nD It could be said that the first industrial community in England grew up around the\nThames. With the host of river workers themselves, as well as the vast assembly of\nancillary trades such as tavern-keepers and laundresses, food-sellers and street-\nhawkers, shopkeepers and marine store dealers - there was a workforce of many\nthousands congregated in a relatively small area. There were more varieties of\nbusiness to be observed by the riverside than ,in any other part of the city. As a\nresult, with the possible exception of the area known as Seven Dials, the East End\nwas also the most intensively inhabited region of London.\n \nE It was a world apart, with its own language and its own laws. From the sailors in\nthe opium dens of Limehouse to the smugglers on the malarial flats of the estuary,\nthe workers of the river were not part of any civilised society. The alien world of the\nriver had entered them. That alienation was also expressed in the slang of the docks,\nwhich essentially amounted to backslang, or the reversal of ordinary words. This\nbackslang also helped in the formulation of Cockney rhyming slang*, so that the\nvocabulary of Londoners was directly'affected by the life of the Thames.\nF The reports in the nineteenth-century press reveal a heterogeneous world of dock\nlabour, in which the crowds of casuals waiting for work at the dock gates at 7.45 a.m.\n \n1\n\ninclude penniless refugees, bankrupts, old soldiers, broken-down gentlemen,\ndischarged servants, and ex-convicts. There were some 400-500 permanent workers\nwho earned a regular wage and who were considered to be the patricians of\ndockside labour. However, there were some 2,500 casual workers who were hired by\nthe shift. The work for which they competed fiercely had become ever more\nunpleasant. Steam power could not be used for the cranes, for example, because of\nthe danger of fire. So the cranes were powered by treadmills. Six to eight men\nentered a wooden cylinder and, laying hold of ropes, would tread the wheel round.\nThey could lift nearly 20 tonnes to an average height of 27 feet (8.2 metres), forty\ntimes in an hour.
