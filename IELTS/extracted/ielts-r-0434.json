  "passage_text": "Reading Practice\n \nThe ballpoint pen\nThe ballpoint pen\n \nMost of us have at least one, but how did this popular item evolve?\n \nOne morning in 1945, a crowd of 5,000 people jammed the entrance of Gimbels\nDepartment Store in New York. The day before, Gimbels had placed a full-page\nadvertisement in the New York Times for a wonderful new invention, the ballpoint pen. The\nadvertisement described the pen as 'fantastic' and 'miraculous'. Although they were\nexpensive, $12.50 each, all 10,000 pens in stock were sold on the first day.\n \nIn fact, this 'new' pen was not new at all. In 1888, John Loud, a leather manufacturer, had\ninvented a pen with a reservoir of ink and a rolling ball. However, his pen was never\nproduced, and efforts by other people to produce a commercially successful one failed too.\nThe main problem was with the ink. If it was too thin, the ink leaked out of the pen. If it was\ntoo thick, it didn't come out of the pen at all.\n \nAlmost fifty years later, in 1935, a newspaper editor in Hungary thought he spent too much\ntime filling his pens with ink. He decided to invent a better kind of pen. With the help of his\nbrother, who was a chemist, he produced a ballpoint pen that didn't leak when the pen\nwasn't being used. The editor was called Ladislas Biro, and it was his name that people\nwould associate more than any other with the ballpoint pen.\n \nBy chance, Biro met Augustine Justo, the Argentinian president. Justo was so impressed\nwith Biro's invention that he invited him to set up a factory in Argentina. In 1943, the first\nBiro pens were produced.\n \nUnfortunately, they were not popular, since the pen needed to be held in a vertical position\nfor the ink to come out. Biro redesigned the pen with a better ball, and in 1944 the new\nproduct was on sale throughout Argentina.\nIt was a North American, Milton Reynolds, who introduced the ballpoint pen to the USA.\nCopying Biro's design, he produced the version that sold so well at Gimbels. Another\nAmerican, Patrick Frawley, improved the design and in 1950 began producing a pen he\ncalled the Papermate. It was an immediate success, and within a few years, Papermates\nwere selling in their millions around the world.\n \n1",
