On Daphne Major-one of the most desolate of the Galápagos\nIslands, an uninhabited volcanic cone where cacti and shrubs seldom grow higher than a\nresearcher’s knee-Peter and Rosemary Grant have spent more than three decades\nwatching Darwin’s finch respond to the challenges of storms, drought and competition for\nfood Biologists at Princeton University, the Grants know and recognize many of the\nindividual birds on the island and can trace the birds’ lineages hack through time. They\nhave witnessed Darwin’s principle in action again and again, over many generations of\nfinches.\nB\nThe Grants’ most dramatic insights have come from watching the evolving bill of the\nmedium ground finch. The plumage of this sparrow-sized bird ranges from dull brown to jet\nblack. At first glance, it may not seem particularly striking, but among scientists who study\nevolutionary biology, the medium ground finch is a superstar. Its bill is a middling example\nin the array of shapes and sizes found among Galápagos finches: heftier than that of the\nsmall ground finch, which specializes in eating small, soft seeds, but petite compared to\nthat of the large ground finch, an expert at cracking and devouring big, hard seeds.\nC\nWhen the Grants began their study in the 1970s, only two species of finch lived on Daphne\nMajor, the medium ground finch and the cactus finch. The island is so small that the\nresearchers were able to count and catalogue every bird. When a severe drought hit in\n1977, the birds soon devoured the last of the small, easily eaten seeds. Smaller members\nof the medium ground finch population, lacking the bill strength to crack large seeds, died\nout.\nD\nBill and body size are inherited traits, and the next generation had a high proportion of big-\nbilled individuals. The Grants had documented natural selection at work-the same process\nthat, over many millennia, directed the evolution of the Galápagos’ 14 unique finch species,\nall descended from a common ancestor that reached the islands a few million years ago.\nE\nEight years later, heavy rains brought by an El Nino transformed the normally meager\nvegetation on Daphne Major. Vines and other plants that in most years struggle for survival\nsuddenly flourished, choking out the plants that provide large seeds to the finches. Small\nseeds came to dominate the food supply, and big birds with big bills died out at a higher\nrate than smaller ones. ‘Natural selection is observable,’ Rosemary Grant says. ‘It happens\nwhen the environment changes. When local conditions reverse themselves, so does the\ndirection of adaptation.\nF\nRecently, the Grants witnessed another form of natural selection acting on the medium\n \n1\n\nground finch: competition from bigger, stronger cousins. In 1982, a third finch, the large\nground finch, came to live on Daphne Major. The stout bills of these birds resemble the\nbusiness end of a crescent wrench. Their arrival was the first such colonization recorded on\nthe Galápagos in nearly a century of scientific observation. ‘We realized,’ Peter Grant says,\n‘we had a very unusual and potentially important event to follow.’ For 20 years, the large\nground finch coexisted with the medium ground finch, which shared the supply of large\nseeds with its bigger-billed relative. Then, in 2002 and 2003, another drought struck. None\nof the birds nested that year, and many died out. Medium ground finches with large bills,\ncrowded out of feeding areas by the more powerful large ground finches, were hit\nparticularly hard.\nG\nWhen wetter weather returned in 2004, and the finches nested again, the new generation\nof the medium ground finch was dominated by smaller birds with smaller bills, able to\nsurvive on smaller seeds. This situation, says Peter Grant, marked the first time that\nbiologists have been able to follow the complete process of an evolutionary change due to\ncompetition between species and the strongest response to natural selection that he had\nseen in 33 years of tracking Galápagos finches.\nH\nOn the inhabited island of Santa Cruz, just south of Daphne Major, Andrew Hendry of\nMcGill University and Jeffrey Podos of the University of Massachusetts at Amherst have\ndiscovered a new, man-made twist in finch evolution. Their study focused on birds living\nnear the Academy Bay research station, on the fringe of the town of Puerto Ayora. The\nhuman population of the area has been growing fast-from 900 people in 1974 to 9,582 in\n2001. Today Puerto Ayora is full of hotels and mai tai bars,’ Hendry says. ‘People have\ntaken this extremely arid place and tried to turn it into a Caribbean resort.’\nI\nAcademy Bay records dating back to the early 1960s show that medium ground finches\ncaptured there had either small or large bills. Very few of the birds had mid-size bills. The\nfinches appeared to be in the early stages of a new adaptive radiation: If the trend\ncontinued, the medium ground finch on Santa Cruz could split into two distinct subspecies,\nspecializing in different types of seeds. But in the late 1960s and early 70s, medium ground\nfinches with medium-sized bills began to thrive at Academy Bay along with small and large-\nbilled birds. The booming human population had introduced new food sources, including\nexotic plants and bird feeding stations stocked with rice. Billsize, once critical to the finches’\nsurvival, no longer made any difference. ‘Now an intermediate bill can do fine,’ Hendry\nsays.\nJ\nAt a control site distant from Puerto Ayora, and relatively untouched by humans, the\nmedium ground finch population remains split between large- and small-billed birds. On\nundisturbed parts of Santa Cruz, there is no ecological niche for a middling medium ground\nfinch, and the birds continue to diversify. In town, though there are still many finches, once-\ndistinct populations are merging.\nK\n \n2\n\nThe finches of Santa Cruz demonstrate a subtle process in which human meddling can\nstop evolution in its tracks, ending the formation of new species. In a time when global\nbiodiversity continues its downhill slide, Darwin’s finches have yet another unexpected\nlesson to teach. ‘If we hope to regain some of the diversity that’s already been lost/ Hendry\nsays, ‘we need to protect not just existing creatures, but also the processes that drive the\norigin of new species.\n \n3",
