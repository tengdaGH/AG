  "passage_text": "Reading Practice\n \nLondon Swaying Footbridge\nA. In September 1996 a competition was organized by the Financial Times in association\nwith the London Borough of Southwark to design a new footbridge across the Thames. The\ncompetition attracted over 200 entries and was won by a team comprising Arup\n(engineers), Foster and Partners (architects) and the sculptor Sir Anthony Caro.\n \nB. The bridge opened to the public on 10 June 2000. Up to 100,000 people crossed it that\nday with up to 2000 people on the bridge at any one time. At first, the bridge was still. Then\nit began to sway just slightly. Then, almost from one moment to the next, when large\ngroups of people were crossing, the wobble intensified. This movement became sufficiently\nlarge for people to stop walking to retain their balance and sometimes to hold onto the\nhand rails for support. It was decided immediately to limit the number of people on the\nbridge, but even so the deck movement was sufficient to be uncomfortable and to raise\nconcern for public safety so that on 12 June the bridge was closed until the problem could\nbe solved.\nC. The embarrassed engineers found the videotape that day which showed the center span\nswaying about 3 inches side to side every second. The engineers first thought that winds\nmight be exerting excessive force on the many large flags and banners bedecking the\nbridge for its gala premiere. What’s more, they also discovered that the pedestrians also\nplayed a key role. Human activities, such as walking, running, jumping, swaying, etc. could\ncause horizontal force which in turn could cause excessive dynamic vibration in the lateral\ndirection in the bridge. As the structure began moving, pedestrians adjusted their gait to the\nsame lateral rhythm as the bridge. The adjusted footsteps magnified the motion – just like\nwhen four people all stand up in a small boat at the same time. As more pedestrians locked\ninto the same rhythm, the increasing oscillations led to the dramatic swaying captured on\nfilm.\nD. In order to design a method of reducing the movements, the force exerted by the\npedestrians had to be quantified and related to the motion of the bridge. Although there are\nsome descriptions of this phenomenon in existing literature, none of these actually\nquantifies the force. So there was no quantitative analytical way to design the bridge\nagainst this effect. An immediate research program was launched by the bridge’s\nengineering designers Ove Arup, supported by a number of universities and research\norganizations.\n \nE. The tests at the University of Southampton involved a person walking ‘on the spot’ on a\nsmall shake table. The tests at Imperial College involved persons walking along a specially\nbuilt, 7.2m-long platform which could be driven laterally at different frequencies (n and\namplitudes. Each type of test had its limitations. The Imperial College tests were only able\nto capture 7-8 footsteps, and the ‘walking on the spot’ tests, although monitoring many\nfootsteps, could not investigate normal forward walking. Neither test could investigate any\ninfluence of other people in a crowd on the behavior of the individual being tested.\nF. The results of the laboratory tests provided information which enabled the initial design\nof a retro-fit to be progressed. However, the limitations of these tests was clear and it was\n \n1\n\nfelt that the only way to replicate properly the precise conditions of the Millennium Bridge\nwas to carry out crowd tests on the bridge deck itself. These tests done by the Arup\nengineers could incorporate factors not possible in the laboratory tests. The first of these\nwas carried out with 100 people in July 2000. The results of these tests were used to refine\nthe load model for the pedestrians. A second series of crowd tests was carried out on the\nbridge in December 2000. The purpose of these tests was to further validate the design\nassumptions and to load test a prototype damper installation. The test was carried out with\n275 people.\nG. Unless the usage of the bridge was to be greatly restricted, only two generic options to\nimprove its performance were considered feasible. The first was to increase the stiffness of\nthe bridge to move all its lateral natural frequencies out of the range that could be excited\nby the lateral footfall forces, and the second was to increase the damping of the bridge to\nreduce the resonant response.\n \n2",
