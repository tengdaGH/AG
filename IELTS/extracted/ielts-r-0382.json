This\nrivalry was characterized by advanced technology and huge budgets. In this process, there\nwere spectacular successes, some failures, but also many spin-offs.\nEurope, Japan, China, and India quickly joined this space club of the superpowers. With\nthe advent of relatively low-cost high-performance mini-satellites and launchers, the\nacquisition of indigenous space capabilities by smaller nations in Asia has become\npossible. How, in what manner, and for what purpose will these capabilities be realized?\n \nA\nRocket technology has progressed considerably since the days of ‘fire arrows’ (bamboo\npoles filled with gunpowder) first used in China around 500 BC, and, during the Sung\nDynasty, to repel Mongol invaders at the battle of Kaifeng (Kai-fung fu) in AD 1232. These\nancient rockets stand in stark contrast to the present-day Chinese rocket launch vehicles,\ncalled the ‘Long March’, intended to place a Chinese astronaut in space by 2005 and,\nperhaps, to achieve a Chinese moon-landing by the end of the decade.\n \nB\nIn the last decade, there has been a dramatic growth in space activities in Asia both in the\nutilization of space-based services and the production of satellites and launchers. This\nrapid expansion has led many commentators and analysts to predict that Asia will become\na world space power. The space-age has had dramatic effects worldwide with direct\ndevelopments in space technology influencing telecommunications, meteorological\nforecasting, earth resource and environmental monitoring, and disaster mitigation (flood,\nforest fires, and oil spills). Asian nations have been particularly eager to embrace these\ndevelopments.\nC \nNew and innovative uses for satellites are constantly being explored with potential\nrevolutionary effects, such as in the field of health and telemedicine, distance education,\ncrime prevention (piracy on the high seas), food and agricultural planning and production\n(rice crop monitoring). Space in Asia is very much influenced by the competitive\ncommercial space sector, the emergence of low-cost mini-satellites, and the globalization\nof industrial and financial markets. It is not evident how Asian space will develop in the\ncoming decades in the face of these trends. It is, however, important to understand and\nassess the factors and forces that shape Asian space activities and development in\ndetermining its possible consequences for the region.\n \nD\nAt present, three Asian nations, Japan, China, and India, have comprehensive end-to-end\nspace capabilities and possess a complete space infrastructure: space technology, satellite\nmanufacturing, rockets, and spaceports. Already self-sufficient in terms of satellite design\nand manufacturing, South Korea is currently attempting to join their ranks with its plans to\ndevelop a launch site and spaceport. Additionally, nations in Southeast Asia as well as\n \n1\n\nthose bordering the Indian subcontinent (Nepal, Pakistan, and Bangladesh), have, or are\nstarting to develop indigenous space programmes. The Association of Southeast Asian\nNations (ASEAN) has, in varying degrees, embraced space applications using foreign\ntechnology and over the past five years or so its space activities have been expanding.\nSoutheast Asia is predicted to become the largest and fastest-growing market for\ncommercial space products and applications, driven by telecommunications (mobile and\nfixed services), the Internet, and remote sensing applications. In the development of this\ntechnology, many non-technical factors, such as economics, politics, culture, and history,\ninteract and play important roles, which in turn affect Asian technology.\n \nE\nAsia and Southeast Asia, in particular, suffers from a long list of recurrent large-scale\nenvironmental problems including storms and flooding, forest fires and deforestation, and\ncrop failures. Thus the space application that has attracted the most attention in this region\nis remote sensing. Remote sensing satellites equipped with instruments to take\nphotographs of the ground at different wavelengths provide essential information for natural\nresource accounting, environmental management, disaster prevention and monitoring,\nland-use mapping, and sustainable development planning. Progress in these applications\nhas been rapid and impressive. ASEAN members, unlike Japan, China, and India, do not\nhave their own remote sensing satellites, however, most of its member nations have\nfacilities to receive, process, and interpret such data from American and European\nsatellites. In particular, Thailand, Malaysia, and Singapore have world-class remote\nsensing processing facilities and research programmes. ASEAN has plans to develop (and\nlaunch) its own satellites and in particular remote sensing satellites. Japan is regarded as\nthe dominant space power in Asia and its record of successes and quality of technologies\nare equal to those of the West. In view of the technological challenges and high risks\ninvolved in space activities, a very long, and expensive, the learning curve has been\nfollowed to obtain those successes achieved. Japan, s satellite manufacturing was based\non the old and traditional defense and military procurement methodologies as practiced in\nthe US and Europe.\n \nF\nIn recent years there have been fundamental changes in the way satellites are designed\nand built to drastically reduce costs. The emergence of ‘small satellites’ and their quick\nadoption by Asian countries as a way to develop low-cost satellite technology and rapidly\nestablish a space capability has given these countries the possibility to shorten their\nlearning curve by a decade or more. The global increase of technology transfer\nmechanisms and use of readily available commercial technology to replace costly space\nand military-standard components may very well result in a highly competitive Asian\nsatellite manufacturing industry.\n \nG\nThe laws of physics are the same in Tokyo as in Toulouse, and the principles of electronics\nand mechanics know no political or cultural boundaries.
