  "passage_text": "Reading Practice\n \nA song on the brain\n \nSome songs just won't leave you alone. But this may give us clues about how our\nbrain works\n \nA Everyone knows the situation where you can't get a song out of your head. You hear a\npop song on the radio - or even just read the song's title and it haunts you for hours,\nplaying over and over in your mind until you're heartily sick of it. The condition now even\nhas a medical name 'song-in-head syndrome'.\n \nBut why does the mind annoy us like this? No one knows for sure, but it's probably\nbecause the brain is better at holding onto information than it is at knowing what\ninformation is important. Roger Chaffin, a psychologist at the University of Connecticut\nsays, 'It's a manifestation of an aspect of memory which is normally an asset to us, but in\nthis instance it can be a nuisance.'\n \n \n \nThis eager acquisitiveness of the brain may have helped our ancestors remember\nimportant information in the past. Today, students use it to learn new material, and\nmusicians rely on it to memorise complicated pieces. But when this useful function goes\nawry it can get you stuck on a tune. Unfortunately, superficial, repetitive pop tunes are, by\ntheir very nature, more likely to stick than something more inventive.\n \nD The annoying playback probably originates in the auditory cortex. Located at the front of\nthe brain, this region handles both listening and playback of music and other sounds.\nNeuroscientist Robert Zatorre of McGill University in Montreal proved this some years ago\nwhen he asked volunteers to replay the theme from the TV show Dallas in their heads.\nBrain imaging studies showed that this activated the same region of the auditory cortex as\nwhen the people actually heard the song.\n \nE Not every stored musical memory emerges into consciousness, however. The frontal\nlobe of the brain gets to decide which thoughts become conscious and which ones are\nsimply stored away. But it can become fatigued or depressed, which is when people most\ncommonly suffer from song-in-head syndrome and other intrusive thoughts, says Susan\nBall, a clinical psychologist at Indiana University School of Medicine in Indianapolis. And\nonce the unwanted song surfaces, it's hard to stuff it back down into the subconscious.\n'The more you try to suppress a thought, the more you get it,' says Ball. 'We call this the\npink elephant phenomenon. Tell the brain not to think about pink elephants, and it's\nguaranteed to do so,' she says.\n \nF For those not severely afflicted, simply avoiding certain kinds of music can help. 'I know\ncertain pieces that are kind of \"sticky\" to me, so I will not play them in the early morning for\nfear that they will run around in my head all day,' says Steven Brown, who trained as a\nclassical pianist but is now a neuroscientist at the University of Texas Health Science\nCenter at San Antonio. He says he always has a song in his head and, even more\nannoying, his mind never seems to make it all the way through. 'It tends to involve short\nfragments between, say, 5 or 15 seconds. They seem to get looped, for hours sometimes,'\nhe says.\nG Brown's experience of repeated musical loops may represent a phenomenon called\n'chunking', in which people remember musical phrases as a single unit of memory, says\n \n1\n\n \nCaroline Palmer, a psychologist at Ohio State University in Columbus. Most listeners have\nlittle choice about what chunks they remember. Particular chunks may be especially 'sticky'\nif you hear them often or if they follow certain predictable patterns, such as the chord\nprogression of rock 'n' roll music. Palmer's research shows that the more a piece of music\nconforms to these patterns, the easier it is to remember. That's why you're more likely to be\nhaunted by the tunes of pop music than by those of a classical composer such as J. S.\nBach.\n \nH But this ability can be used for good as well as annoyance. Teachers can tap into\nmemory reinforcement by setting their lessons to music. For example, in one experiment\nstudents who heard a history text set as the lyrics to a catchy song remembered the words\nbetter than those who simply read them, says Sandra Calvert, a psychologist at\nGeorgetown University in Washington DC.\nI This sort of memory enhancement may even explain the origin of music. Before the\nwritten word could be used to record history, people memorised it in songs, says Leon\nJames, a psychologist at the University of Hawaii. And music may have had an even more\nimportant role. ‘All music has a message.' he says. ‘This message functions to unite society\nand to standardise the thought processes of people in society.’\n \n2",
