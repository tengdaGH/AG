Hundreds, and indeed thousands, of years ago, this actually worked quite\nwell. People who travelled to foreign lands, often by ship, would take with them items for\ntrade. Agricultural countries would, for example, trade olive oil or wine for weapons or other\nworked items. All that needed to be negotiated was a fair’price’for the items. (How many\naxes is a barrel of oil worth, for example?) Currency did not enter into the first deals but,\neven when it did, few problems existed to complicate matters barring disagreements over\nthe value of goods.\nToday, fixing a fair price remains at the centre of international commerce. When we look at\nthe deal from the point of view of the seller, market research must determine the price at\nwhich the goods will be sold. This may vary greatly from country to country and people are\noften surprised to see exactly the same item for sale at two or three times the price it sells\nfor in another country.Taxation and local government controls are sometimes behind this,\nbut often it comes down to the fact that people in poor countries simply cannot afford to pay\nthe same amount of money as those in rich countries. These are the things a seller has to\nbear in mind when preparing a price list for goods in each country.\nIn most cases, the purpose of setting a suitable price is to sell the maximum number of\nunits. Usually, this is the way to guarantee the biggest profit. One exception is in the selling\nof luxury or specialist goods. These are often goods for which there is a limited market\nHere, slightly different rules apply because the profit margin (the amount of money a\nproducer makes on each item) is much higher. For instance, nearly everyone wants to own\na television or a mobile phone, and there is a lot of competition in the area of production,\nforcing the prices to be competitive too. The producers have to sell a large number of items\nto make a profit because their profit margin is small. But not everyone wants to buy hand-\nmade jewellery, or a machine for sticking labels onto bottles.This enables the producer to\ncharge a price much higher than the cost of making the item, increasing the profit margin.\nBut at the heart of any sale, whether they sell many items for a small profit, ora few items\nfor a large profit the prime motivation for the producer is to make as much profit as\npossible.\nAt least, that was the case until relatively recently when, to the great surprise of many,\ncompanies started trading without profit as their main objective. Ethical trade began as an\nattempt to cause as little damage as possible to the producers of raw materials and\nmanufactured goods in poor countries.This movement put pressure on the industry to see\nto it that working conditions and human rights were not damaged by the need for poorer\npeople to produce goods. In short, it drew to the world’s attention the fact that many poor\npeople were being exploited by big businesses in their drive to make more profit.\nThere have been many examples throughout the developing world where local producers\nwere forced by economic pressure to supply cash crops such as tea, coffee and cotton to\nmajor industries. These people are frequently not in a position to fix their prices, and are\noften forced by market conditions to sell for a price too low to support the producers and\ntheir community. Worse still, while the agricultural land is given over to cash crops, it robs\nthe local people of the ability to grow their own food. In time, through over-production, the\n \n1\n\nland becomes spent and infertile, leading to poverty, starvation, and sometimes the\ndestruction of the whole community.\nFair trade policies differ from ethical trade policies in that they take the process a stage\nfurther. Where ethical policies are designed to keep the damage to a minimum, fair trade\norganisations actually work to improve conditions among producers and their communities.\nFair trade organisations view sustainability as a key aim. This involves implementing\npolicies where producers are given a fair price for the goods they sell, so that they and their\ncommunities can continue to operate.\nAlthough many big businesses are cynical about an operation that does not regard profit as\na main driving force, the paradox is that it will help them too. With sustainability as their\nmain aim, fair trade organisations not only help the poorer producers obtain a reasonable\nstandard of living, but they also help guarantee a constant supply of raw materials. This\nform of sustainability benefits everyone, whether their motive is making a profit or\nimproving the lives of the world’s poorer people.\n \n2",
