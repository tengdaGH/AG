It can smell things with its\nnose. It is the only bird in the world that can smell things. The kiwi's eggs are very big.\nThere are only a few kiwis in New Zealand now. A recent survey shows that kiwis are\ndisappearing rapidly from the forests where they have lived for thousands of years. People\nhardly see them except in a New Zealand Zoo.
