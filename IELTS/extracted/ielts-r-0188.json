  "passage_text": "Reading Practice\n \nGreat Migrations\n \nAnimal migration, however it is defined, is far more than just the movement of animals. It\ncan loosely be described as travel that takes place at regular intervals - often in an annual\ncycle - that may involve many members of a species, and is rewarded only after a long\njourney. It suggests inherited instinct. The biologist Hugh Dingle has identified five\ncharacteristics that apply, in varying degrees and combinations, to all migrations. They are\nprolonged movements that carry animals outside familiar habitats; they tend to be linear,\nnot zigzaggy; they involve special behaviours concerning preparation (such as overfeeding)\nand arrival; they demand special allocations of energy. And one more: migrating animals\nmaintain an intense attentiveness to the greater mission, which keeps them undistracted by\ntemptations and undeterred by challenges that would turn other animals aside. \nAn arctic tern, on its 20,000 km flight from the extreme south of South America to the Arctic\ncircle, will take no notice of a nice smelly herring offered from a bird-watcher's boat along\nthe way. While local gulls will dive voraciously for such handouts, the tern flies on. Why?\nThe arctic tern resists distraction because it is driven at that moment by an instinctive\nsense of something we humans find admirable: larger purpose. In other words, it\nis determined to reach its destination. The bird senses that it can eat, rest and mate later.\nRight now it is totally focused on the journey; its undivided intent is arrival.\nReaching some gravelly coastline in the Arctic, upon which other arctic terns\nhave converged, will serve its larger purpose as shaped by evolution: finding a place,\na time, and a set of circumstances in which it can successfully hatch and rear offspring.\nBut migration is a complex issue, and biologists define it differently, depending in part on\nwhat sorts of animals they study. Joe! Berger, of the University of Montana, who works on\nthe American pronghorn and other large terrestrial mammals, prefers what he calls a\nsimple, practical definition suited to his beasts: 'movements from a seasonal home area\naway to another home area and back again'. Generally the reason for such seasonal back-\nand-forth movement is to seek resources that aren't available within a single area year-\nround.\nBut daily vertical movements by zooplankton in the ocean - upward by night to seek food,\ndownward by day to escape predators - can also be considered migration. So can the\nmovement of aphids when, having depleted the young leaves on one food plant, their\noffspring then fly onward to a different host plant, with no one aphid ever returning to where\nit started.\nDingle is an evolutionary biologist who studies insects. His definition is more intricate than\nBerger's, citing those five features that distinguish migration from other forms of movement.\nThey allow for the fact that, for example, aphids will become sensitive to blue light (from the\nsky) when it's time for takeoff on their big journey, and sensitive to yellow light (reflected\nfrom tender young leaves) when it's appropriate to land. Birds will fatten themselves with\nheavy feeding in advance of a long migrational flight. The value of his definition, Dingle\nargues, is that it focuses attention on what the phenomenon of wildebeest migration shares\nwith the phenomenon of the aphids, and therefore helps guide researchers\ntowards understanding how evolution has produced them all.\nHuman behaviour, however, is having a detrimental impact on animal migration.\n1\n\nThe pronghorn, which resembles an antelope, though they are unrelated, is the fastest land\nmammal of the New World. One population, which spends the summer in the mountainous\nGrand Teton National Park of the western USA, follows a narrow route from its summer\nrange in the mountains, across a river, and down onto the plains. Here they wait out the\nfrozen months, feeding mainly on sagebrush blown clear of snow. These pronghorn\nare notable for the invariance of their migration route and the severity of its constriction at\nthree bottlenecks. If they can't pass through each of the three during their spring migration,\nthey can't reach their bounty of summer grazing; if they can't pass through again in autumn,\nescaping south onto those windblown plains, they are likely to die trying to overwinter in\nthe deep snow. Pronghorn, dependent on distance vision and speed to keep safe\nfrom predators, traverse high, open shoulders of land, where they can see and run. At one\nof the bottlenecks, forested hills rise to form a V, leaving a corridor of open ground only\nabout 150 metres wide, filled with private homes. Increasing development is leading toward\na crisis for the pronghorn, threatening to choke off their passageway.\nConservation scientists, along with some biologists and land managers within the USA's\nNational Park Service and other agencies, are now working to preserve migrational\nbehaviours, not just species and habitats. A National Forest has recognised the path of the\npronghorn, much of which passes across its land, as a protected migration corridor. But\nneither the Forest Service nor the Park Service can control what happens on private land at\na bottleneck. And with certain other migrating species, the challenge is complicated further\n- by vastly greater distances traversed, more jurisdictions, more borders, more dangers\nalong the way. We will require wisdom and resoluteness to ensure that migrating species\ncan continue their journeying a while longer.\n2",
