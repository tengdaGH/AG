  "passage_text": "Reading Practice\n \nRunning on empty\n \nA revolutionary new theory in sports physiology.\n \nA For almost a century, scientists have presumed, not unreasonably, that fatigue - or\nexhaustion in athletes originates in the muscles. Precise explanations have varied\nbut all have been based on the ‘limitations theory’. In other words, muscles tire\nbecause they hit a physical limit: they either run out of fuel or oxygen or they drown\nin toxic by-products.\n \nB In the past few years, however, Timothy Noakes and Alan St Clair Gibson from the\nUniversity of Cape Town, South Africa, have examined this standard theory. The\ndeeper they dig, the more convinced they have become that physical fatigue simply\nisn't the same as a car running out of petrol. Fatigue, they argue, is caused not by\ndistress signals springing from overtaxed muscles, but is an emotional response which\nbegins in the brain. The essence of their new theory is that the brain, using a mix of\nphysiological, subconscious and conscious cues, paces the muscles to keep them well\nback from the brink of exhaustion. When the brain decides its time to quit, it creates the\ndistressing sensations we interpret as unbearable muscle fatigue. This ‘central governor*\ntheory remains controversial, but it does explain many puzzling aspects of athletic\nperformance.\n \nC A recent discovery that Noakes calls the ‘lactic acid paradox' made him start\nresearching this area seriously. Lactic acid is a by-product of exercise, and its\naccumulation is often cited as a cause of fatigue. But when research subjects\nexercise in conditions simulating high altitude, they become fatigued even though\nlactic acid levels remain low. Nor has the oxygen content of their blood fallen too\nlow for them to keep going. Obviously, Noakes deduced, something else was making\nthem tire before they hit either of these physiological limits.\n \nD Probing further, Noakes conducted an experiment with seven cyclists who had\nsensors taped to their legs to measure the nerve impulses travelling through their\nmuscles. It has long been known that during exercise, the body never uses 100% of\nthe available muscle fibres in a single contraction. The amount used varies, but in\nendurance tasks such as this cycling test the body calls on about 30%.\nE Noakes reasoned that if the limitations theory was correct and fatigue was due to\nmuscle fibres hitting some limit, the number of fibres used for each pedal stroke\nshould increase as the fibres tired and the cyclist’s body attempted to compensate\nby recruiting an ever-larger proportion of the total. But his team found exactly the\nopposite. As fatigue set in, the electrical activity in the cyclists' legs declined - even\nduring sprinting, when they were striving to cycle as fast as they could.\nF To Noakes, this was strong evidence that the old theory was wrong. ‘The cyclists\nmay have felt completely exhausted,’ he says, ‘but their bodies actually had\nconsiderable reserves that they could theoretically tap by using a greater proportion\nof the resting fibres.’ This, he believes, is proof that the brain is regulating the pace\nof the workout to hold the cyclists well back from the point of catastrophic\nexhaustion.\n \n1\n\n \nG More evidence comes from the fact that fatigued muscles don’t actually run out of\nanything critical. Levels of glycogen, which is the muscles’ primary fuel, and ATP.\nthe chemical they use for temporary energy storage, decline with exercise but never\nbottom out. Even at the end of a marathon, ATP levels are 80-90% of the resting\nnorm, and glycogen levels never get to zero.\n \nH Further support for the central regulator comes from the fact that top athletes\nusually manage to go their fastest at the end of a race, even though, theoretically,\nthat's when their muscles should be closest to exhaustion. But Noakes believes the\nend spurt makes no sense if fatigue is caused by muscles poisoning themselves\nwith lactic acid as this would cause racers to slow down rather than enable them to\nsprint for the finish line. In the new theory, the explanation is obvious. Knowing the\nend is near, the brain slightly relaxes its vigil, allowing the athlete to tap some of the\nbody’s carefully hoarded reserves.\nI But the central governor theory does not mean that what's happening in the muscles is\nirrelevant. The governor constantly monitors physiological signals from the muscles, along\nwith other information, to set the level of fatigue. A large number of signals are probably\ninvolved but, unlike the limitations theory, the central governor theory suggests that these\nphysiological factors are not the direct determinants of fatigue, but simply information to\ntake into account.\nJ Conscious factors can also intervene. Noakes believes that the central regulator\nevaluates the planned workout, and sets a pacing strategy accordingly. Experienced\nrunners know that if they set out on a 10-kilometre run. the first kilometre feels\neasier than the first kilometre of a 5-kilometre run, even though there should be no\ndifference. That, Noakes says, is because the central governor knows you have\nfarther to go in the longer run and has programmed itself to dole out fatigue\nsymptoms accordingly.\nK St Clair Gibson believes there is a good reason why our bodies arc designed to\nkeep something back. That way, there's always something left in the tank for an\nemergency. In ancient times, and still today, life would be too dangerous if our\nbodies allowed us to become so tired that we couldn't move quickly when faced with\nan unexpected need.\n \n2",
