  "passage_text": "Reading Practice\n \nThe Rainmaker design\nA\nSometimes ideas just pop up out of the blue. Or in Charlie Paton’s case, out of the rain. ‘I\nwas on a bus in Morocco traveling through the desert,’ he remembers. ‘It had been raining\nand the bus was full of hot, wet people. The windows steamed up and I went to sleep with\na towel against the glass. When I woke, the thing was soaking wet. I had to wring it out.\nAnd it set me thinking. Why was it so wet?\nB\nThe answer, of course, was condensation. Back home in London, a physicist friend, Philip\nDavies, explained that the glass, chilled by the rain outside, had cooled the hot humid air\ninside the bus below its dew point, causing droplets of water to form on the inside of the\nwindow. Intrigued, Paton – a lighting engineer by profession – started rigging up his own\nequipment. ‘I made my own solar stills It occurred to me that you might be able to produce\nwater in this way in the desert, simply by cooling the air. I wondered whether you could\nmake enough to irrigate fields and grow crops.’\nC\nToday, a decade on, his dream has taken shape as a giant greenhouse on a desert island\noff Abu Dhabi in the Persian Gulf – the first commercially viable version of his ‘seawater\ngreenhouse’. Local scientists, working with Paton, are watering the desert and growing\nvegetables in what is basically a giant dew-making machine that produces freshwater and\ncool air from sun and seawater. In awarding Paton first prize in a design competition two\nyears ago, Marco Goldschmied, president of the Royal Institute of British Architects, called\nit ‘a truly original idea which has the potential to impact on the lives of millions of people\nliving in coastal water-starved areas around the world’.\nD\nThe seawater greenhouse as developed by Paton has three main parts. They both air-\ncondition the greenhouse and provide water for irrigation. The front of the greenhouse\nfaces into the prevailing wind so that hot dry air blows in through a front wall. The wall is\nmade of perforated cardboard kept moist by a constant trickle of seawater pumped up from\nthe ocean. The purpose is to cool and moisten the incoming desert air. The cool moist air\nallows the plants to grow faster. And, crucially, because much less water evaporates from\nthe leaves, the plants need much less moisture to grow than if they were being irrigated in\nthe hot dry desert air outside the greenhouse.\nE\nThe air-conditioning of the interior of the greenhouse is completed by the second feature:\nthe roof.
