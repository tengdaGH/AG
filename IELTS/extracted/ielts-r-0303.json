  "passage_text": "Reading Practice\n \nMystery in Easter Island\nA\nOne of the world’s most famous yet least visited archaeological sites, Easter Island is a\nsmall, hilly, now treeless island of volcanic origin. Located in the Pacific Ocean at 27\ndegrees south of the equator and some 2200 miles (3600 kilometers) off the coast of Chile,\nit is considered to be the world’s most remote inhabited island. The island is, technically\nspeaking, a single massive volcano rising over ten thousand feet from the Pacific Ocean\nfloor. The island received its most well-known current name, Easter Island, from the Dutch\nsea captain Jacob Roggeveen who became the first European to visit Easter Sunday, April\n5, 1722.\nB\nIn the early 1950s, the Norwegian explorer Thor Heyerdahl popularized the idea that the\nisland had been originally settled by advanced societies of Indians from the coast of South\nAmerica. Extensive archaeological, ethnographic and linguistic research has conclusively\nshown this hypothesis to be inaccurate. It is now recognized that the original inhabitants of\nEaster Island are of Polynesian stock (DNA extracts from skeletons have confirmed this),\nthat they most probably came from the Marquesas or Society islands, and that they arrived\nas early as 318 AD (carbon dating of reeds from a grave confirms this). At the time of their\narrival, much of the island was forested, was teeming with land birds, and was perhaps the\nmost productive breeding site for seabirds in the Polynesia region. Because of the plentiful\nbird, fish and plant food sources, the human population grew and gave rise to a rich\nreligious and artistic culture.\nC\nThat culture’s most famous features are its enormous stone statues called moai, at least\n288 of which once stood upon massive stone platforms called ahu. There are some 250 of\nthese ahu platforms spaced approximately one-half mile apart and creating an almost\nunbroken line around the perimeter of the island. Another 600 moai statues, in various\nstages of completion, are scattered around the island, either in quarries or along ancient\nroads between the quarries and the coastal areas where the statues were most often\nerected. Nearly all the moai are carved from the tough stone of the Rano Raraku volcano.\nThe average statue is 14 feet and 6 inches tall and weighs 14 tons. Some moai were as\nlarge as 33 feet and weighed more than 80 tons. Depending upon the size of the statues, it\nhas been estimated that between 50 and 150 people were needed to drag them across the\ncountryside on sledges and rollers made from the island’s trees.\nD\nScholars are unable to definitively explain the function and use of the moai statues. It is\nassumed that their carving and erection derived from an idea rooted in similar practices\nfound elsewhere in Polynesia but which evolved in a unique way on Easter Island.\nArchaeological and iconographic analysis indicates that the statue cult was based on an\nideology of male, lineage-based authority incorporating anthropomorphic symbolism. The\nstatues were thus symbols of authority and power, both religious and political. But they\nwere not only symbols. To the people who erected and used them, they were actual\n \n1\n\nrepositories of sacred spirit. Carved stone and wooden objects in ancient Polynesian\nreligions, when properly fashioned and ritually prepared, were believed to be charged by a\nmagical spiritual essence called mana. The ahu platforms of Easter Island were the\nsanctuaries of the people, and the moai statues were the ritually charged sacred objects of\nthose sanctuaries.\nE\nBesides its more well-known name, Easter Island is also known as Te-Pito-O-Te-Henuab,\nmeaning ‘The Navel of the World’, and as Mata-Ki-Te-Rani, meaning ‘Eyes Looking at\nHeaven’. These ancient name and a host of mythological details ignored by mainstream\narchaeologists point to the possibility that the remote island may once have been a\ngeodetic marker and the site of an astronomical observatory of a long-forgotten civilization.\nIn his book, Heaven’s Mirror, Graham Hancock suggests that Easter Island may once have\nbeen a significant scientific outpost of this antediluvian civilization and that its location had\nextreme importance in a planet-spanning, mathematically precise grid of sacred sites. Two\nother alternative scholars, Christopher Knight and Robert Lomas, have extensively studied\nthe location and possible function of these geodetic markers. In their fascinating book,\nUriel’s Machine, they suggest that one purpose of the geodetic markers was as part of a\nglobal network of sophisticated astronomical observatories dedicated to predicting and\npreparing for future commentary impacts and crystal displacement cataclysms.\nF\nIn the latter years of the 20th century and the first years of the 21st century, various writers\nand scientists have advanced theories regarding the rapid decline of Easter Island’s\nmagnificent civilization around the time of the first European contact. Principal among these\ntheories, and now shown to be inaccurate, is that postulated by Jared Diamond in his\nbook Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Survive. Basically, these theories state\nthat a few centuries after Easter Island’s initial colonization the resource needs of the\ngrowing population had begun to outpace the island’s capacity to renew itself ecologically.\nBy the 1400s the forests had been entirely cut, the rich ground cover had eroded away, the\nsprings had dried up, and the vast flocks of birds coming to roost on the island had\ndisappeared. With no logs to build canoes for offshore fishing, with depleted bird and\nwildlife food sources, and with declining crop yields because of the erosion of good soil, the\nnutritional intake of the people plummeted. First famine, then cannibalism, set in. Because\nthe island could no longer feed the chiefs, bureaucrats and priests who kept the complex\nsociety running, the resulting chaos triggered a social and cultural collapse. By 1700 the\npopulation dropped to between one-quarter and one-tenth of its former number, and many\nof the statues were toppled during supposed “clan wars” of the 1600 and 1700s.\nG\nThe faulty notions presented in these theories began with the racist assumptions of Thor\nHeyerdahl and have been perpetuated by writers, such as Jared Diamond, who do not\nhave sufficient archaeological and historical understanding of the actual events which\noccurred on Easter Island. The real truth regarding the tremendous social devastation\nwhich occurred on Easter Island is that it was a direct consequence of the inhumane\nbehavior of many of the first European visitors, particularly the slavers who raped and\nmurdered the islanders, introduced smallpox and other diseases, and brutally removed the\nnatives to mainland South America.\n \n2",
