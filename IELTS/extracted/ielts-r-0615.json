  "passage_text": "Reading Practice\n \nWestern Immigration of Canada\nA\nBy the mid-1870s Canada wanted an immigrant population of agricultural settlers\nestablished in the West. No urban centres existed on the prairies in the 1870s, and rural\nsettlement was the focus of the federal government’s attention. The western rural\nsettlement was desired, as it would provide homesteads for the sons and daughters of\neastern farmers, as eastern agricultural landfilled to capacity. As well, eastern farmers and\npoliticians viewed western Canada, with its broad expanses of unpopulated land, as a\nprime location for expanding Canada’s agricultural output, especially in terms of wheat\nproduction to serve the markets of eastern Canada.\nB\nTo bolster Canada’s population and agricultural output, the federal government took steps\nto secure western land. The Dominion of Canada purchased Rupert’s Land from the\nHudson’s Bay Company in 1870. In 1872, the federal government enacted the Dominion\nLands Act. This act enabled settlers to acquire 160 acres of free land, as long as settlers\nremained on their land for a period of three years, made certain minor improvements to the\nland, and paid a $10.00 registration fee. The Canadian government also created a\nMounted Police Force in 1873. The Mounties journeyed west to secure the area for future\nsettlers. By 1876 the NWMP had established themselves in the West. The major posts\nincluded Swan River, Fort Saskatchewan, Fort Calgary, Fort Walsh and Fort Macleod. All\nof these initiatives attracted a number of eastern-Canadian settlers, as well as European\nand American immigrants, to Canada’s West, and particularly to the area of Manitoba.\nC\nThe surest way to protect Canadian territory, and to achieve the secondary goal for joining\nBritish Columbia to the rest of the country, was to import large numbers of Eastern\nCanadian and British settlers. Settling the West also made imperative the building of a\ntranscontinental railway. The railway would work to create an east-west economy, in which\nwestern Canada would feed the growing urban industrial population of the east, and in\nreturn become a market for eastern Canadian manufactured goods.\nD\nWinnipeg became the metropolis of the West during this period. Winnipeg’s growth before\n1900 was the result of a combination of land speculation, growth of housing starts, and the\nfederal government’s solution in 1881 of Winnipeg as a major stop along the CPR. This\ndecision culminated in a land boom between 1881 and 1883 which resulted in the\ntransformation of hamlets like Portage la Prairie and Brandon into towns, and a large\nincrease in Manitoba’s population. Soon, Winnipeg stood at the junction of three\ntranscontinental railway lines which employed thousands in rail yards. Winnipeg also\nbecame the major processor of agricultural products for the surrounding hinterland.\nE\nThe majority of settlers to Winnipeg, and the surrounding countryside, during this early\nperiod, were primarily Protestant English-speaking settlers from Ontario and the British\n \n1\n\nIsles. These settlers established Winnipeg upon a British-Ontarian ethos which came to\ndominate the society’s social, political, and economic spirit. This British-Ontarian ethnic\nhomogeneity, however, did not last very long. Increasing numbers of foreign immigrants,\nespecially from Austria-Hungary and Ukraine soon added a new ethnic element to the\nrecent British, the older First Nation Métis, and Selkirk’s settler population base. Settling\nthe West with (in particular) Eastern Canadians and British immigrant offered the\nadvantage of safeguarding the 49th parallel from the threat of American take-over, had not\nthe Minnesota legislature passed a resolution which provided for the annexation of the Red\nRiver district. The Red River in 1870 was the most important settlement on the Canadian\nprairies. It contained 11,963 inhabitants of whom 9,700 were Métis and First Nations. But\nneighbouring Minnesota already had a population of over 100,000.\nF\nNot all of the settlers who came to western Canada in the 1880s, however, desired to\nremain there. In the 1870s and 1880s, economic depression kept the value of Canada’s\nstaple exports low, which discouraged many from permanent settlement in the West.\nCountries including Brazil, Argentina, Australia, New Zealand and the United States\ncompeted with Canada for immigrants. Many immigrants and thousands of Canadians\nchose to settle in the accessible and attractive American frontier. Canada before 1891 has\nbeen called “a huge demographic railway station” where thousands of men, women, and\nchildren were constantly going and coming, and where the number of departures invariably\nexceeded that of arrivals.”\nG\nBy 1891 Eastern Canada had its share of both large urban centres and problems\nassociated with city life. While the booming economic centres of Toronto and Montreal\nwere complete with electricity and telephones in the cities’ wealthiest areas by the turn of\nthe century, slum conditions characterised the poorest areas like the district known as ‘the\nWard’ in Toronto. Chickens and pigs ran through the streets; privy buckets spilled onto\nbackyards and lanes creating cesspools in urban slums. These same social reformers\nbelieved that rural living, in stark contrast to urban, would lead to a healthy, moral, and\ncharitable way of life. Social reformers praised the ability of fresh air, hard work, and open\nspaces for ‘Canadianizing’ immigrants. Agricultural pursuits were seen as especially fitting\nfor attaining this ‘moral’ and family-oriented way of life, in opposition to the single male-\ndominated atmosphere of the cities. Certainly, agriculture played an important part in the\nCanadian economy in 1891. One-third of the workforce worked on farms.\nH\nThe Canadian government presented Canada’s attractions to potential overseas migrants\nin several ways. The government offered free or cheap land to potential agriculturists. As\nwell, the government established agents and/or agencies for the purpose of attracting\nemigrants overseas. Assisted passage schemes, bonuses and commissions to agents and\nsettlers and pamphlets also attracted some immigrants to Canada. The most influential\nform of attracting others to Canada, however, remained the letters home written by\nemigrants already in Canada. Letters from trusted friends and family members. Letters\nhome often contained exaggerations of the ‘wonder of the new world.’ Migrant workers and\nsettlers already in Canada did not want to disappoint, or worry, their family and friends at\nhome. Embellished tales of good fortune and happiness often succeeded in encouraging\n \n2\n\nothers to come.\n \n3",
