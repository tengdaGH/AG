  "passage_text": "Reading Practice\n \nFood for thought 2\n \nA\nThere are not enough classrooms at the Msekeni primary school, so half the lessons take\nplace in the shade of yellow-blossomed acacia trees. Given this shortage, it might seem\nodd that one of the school’s purpose-built classrooms has been emptied of pupils and\nturned into a storeroom for sacks of grain. But it makes sense. Food matters more than\nshelter.\nB\nMsekeni is in one of the poorer parts of Malawi, a landlocked southern African country of\nexceptional beauty and great poverty. No war lays waste Malawi, nor is the land unusually\ncrowed or infertile, but Malawians still have trouble finding enough to eat. Half of the\nchildren under five are underfed to the point of stunting. Hunger blights most aspects of\nMalawian life, so the country is as good a place as any to investigate how nutrition affects\ndevelopment, and vice versa.\nC\nThe headmaster at Msekeni, Bernard Kumanda, has strong views on the subject. He thinks\nfood is a priceless teaching aid. Since 1999, his pupils have received free school lunches.\nDonors such as the World Food Programme (WFP) provide the food: those sacks of grain\n(mostly mixed maize and soya bean flour, enriched with vitamin A) in that converted\nclassroom. Local volunteers do the cooking – turning the dry ingredients into a bland but\nnutritious slop and spooning it out on to plastic plates. The children line up in large crowds,\ncheerfully singing a song called “We are getting porridge”.\nD\nWhen the school’s feeding programme was introduced, enrolment at Msekeni doubled.\nSome of the new pupils had switched from nearby schools that did not give out free\nporridge, but most were children whose families had previously kept them at home to work.\nThese families were so poor that the long-term benefits of education seemed unattractive\nwhen setting against the short-term gain of sending children out to gather firewood or help\nin the fields. One plate of porridge a day completely altered the calculation. A child fed at\nschool will not howl so plaintively for food at home. Girls, who are more likely than boys to\nbe kept out of school, are given extra snacks to take home.\nE\nWhen a school takes in a horde of extra students from the poorest homes, you would\nexpect standards to drop. Anywhere in the world, poor kids tend to perform worse than\ntheir better-off classmates. When the influx of new pupils is not accompanied by an\nincrease in the number of teachers, as was the case at Msekeni, you would expect\nstandards to fall even further. But they have not. Pass rates at Msekeni improved\ndramatically, from 30% to 85%. Although this was an exceptional example, the nationwide\nresults of school feeding programmes were still pretty good. On average, after a Malawian\nschool started handing out free food it attracted 38% more girls and 24% more boys. The\n \n1\n\npass rate for boys stayed about the same, while for girls it improved by 9.5%.\nF\nBetter nutrition makes for brighter children. Most immediately, well-fed children find it easier\nto concentrate. It is hard to focus the mind on long division when your stomach is\nscreaming for food. Mr Kumanda says that it used to be easy to spot the kids who were\nreally undernourished. “They were the ones who stared into space and didn’t respond\nwhen you asked the question,” he says. More crucially, though, more and better food helps\nbrains grow and develop. Like any other organ in the body, the brain needs nutrition and\nexercise. But if it is starved of the necessary calories, proteins and micronutrients, it is\nstunted, perhaps not as severely as a muscle would be, but stunted nonetheless. That is\nwhy feeding children at schools work so well. And the fact that the effect of feeding was\nmore pronounced in girls than in boys gives a clue to who eats first in rural Malawian\nhouseholds. It isn’t the girls.\nG\nOn a global scale, the good news is that people are eating better than ever before. Homo\nsapiens has grown 50% bigger since the industrial revolution. Three centuries ago, chronic\nmalnutrition was more or less universal. Now, it is extremely rare in rich countries. In\ndeveloping countries, where most people live, plates and rice bowls are also fuller than\never before. The proportion of children under five in the developing world who are\nmalnourished to the point of stunting fell from 39% in 1990 to 30% in 2000, says the World\nHealth Organisation (WHO). In other places, the battle against hunger is steadily being\nwon. Better nutrition is making people cleverer and more energetic, which will help them\ngrow more prosperous. And when they eventually join the ranks of the well off, they can\nstart fretting about growing too fast.\n \n2",
