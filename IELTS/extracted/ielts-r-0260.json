  "passage_text": "Reading Practice\n \n \nLighting up the lies\n \nA Last year Sean A. Spence, a professor at the school of medicine at the University of\nSheffield in England, performed brain scans that showed that a woman convicted of\npoisoning a child in her care appeared to be telling the truth when she denied committing\nthe crime. This deception study, along with two others performed by the Sheffield group,\nwas funded by Quickfire Media, a television production company working for the U.K.’s\nChannel 4, which broadcast videos of the researchers at work as part of a three-part series\ncalled “Lie Lab.” The brain study of the woman later appeared in the journal European\nPsychiatry.\nB Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) purports to detect mendacity by seeing\ninside the brain instead of tracking peripheral measures of anxiety—such as changes in\npulse, blood pressure or respiration —measured by a polygraph. Besides drawing\nhundreds of thousands of viewers, fMRI has pulled in entrepreneurs. Two\ncompanies—Cephos in Pepperell, Mass., and No Lie MRI in Tarzana, Calif.—claim to\npredict with 90 percent or greater certitude whether you are telling the truth. No Lie MRI,\nwhose name evokes the casual familiarity of a walk-in dental clinic in a strip mall, suggests\nthat the technique may even be used for “risk reduction in dating” .\n \nC Many neuroscientists and legal scholars doubt such claims—and some even question\nwhether brain scans for lie detection will ever be ready for anything but more research on\nthe nature of deception and the brain. An fMRI machine tracks blood flow to activated brain\nareas. The assumption in lie detection is that the\nbrain must exert extra effort when telling a lie and that the regions that do more work get\nmore blood. Such areas light up in scans; during the lie studies, the illuminated regions are\nprimarily involved in decision making.\nD To assess how fMRI and other neurocience findings affect the law, the Mac- Arthur\nFoundation put up $10 million last year to pilot for three years the Law and Neuroscience\nProject. Part of the funding will attempt to set criteria for accurate and reliable lie detection\nusing fMRI and other brain-scanning technology. “I think it’s not possible, given the current\ntechnology, to trust the results,” says Marcus Raichle, a neuroscientist at the Washington\nUniversity School of Medicine in St. Louis who heads the project’s study group on lie\ndetection. “But it’s not impossible to set up a research program to determine whether that’s\npossible.” A major review article last year in the American Journal of Law and Medicine by\nHenry T. Greely of Stanford University and Judy Illes, now at the University of British\nColumbia, explores the deficiencies of existing research and what may be needed to move\nthe technology forward. The two scholars found that lie detection studies conducted so far\n(still less than 20 in all) failed to prove that fMRI is “effective as a lie detector in the real\nworld at any accuracy level.”\nMost studies examined groups, not individuals.Subjects in these studies were healthy\nyoung adults—making it unclear how the results would apply to someone who takes a drug\nthat affects blood pressure or has a blockage in an artery. And the two researchers\nquestioned the specificity of the lit-up areas; they noted that the regions also correlate with\na wide range of cognitive behaviors, including memory, self- monitoring and conscious self-\nawareness.\nThe biggest challenge for which the Law and Neuroscience Project is already funding new\n \n1\n\nresearch—is how to diminish the artificiality of the test protocol. Lying about whether a\nplaying card is the seven of spades may not activate the same areas of the cortex as\nanswering a question about whether you robbed the comer store. In fact, the most realistic\nstudies to date may have come from the Lie Lab television programs. The two companies\nmarketing the technology are not waiting for more data. Cephos is offering scans without\ncharge to people who claim they were falsely accused if they meet certain criteria in an\neffort to get scans accepted by the courts. Allowing scans as legal evidence could open a\npotentially huge and lucrative market. “We may have to take many shots on goal before we\nactually see a courtroom,” says Cephos chief executive Steven\n \nLaken. He asserts that the technology has achieved 97 percent accuracy and that the more\nthan 100 people scanned using the Cephos protocol have provided data that have resolved\nmany of the issues that Greely and Illes cited.\nG But until formal clinical trials prove that the machines meet safety and effectiveness\ncriteria, Greely and Illes have called for a ban on non-research uses. Trials envisaged for\nregulatory approval hint at the technical challenges. Actors, professional poker players and\nsociopaths would be compared against average Joes. The devout would go in the scanner\nafter nonbelievers. Testing would take into account social setting. White lies—“no, dinner\nreally was fantastic”—would have to be compared against untruths about sexual\npeccadilloes to ensure that the brain reacts identically.\nH There potential for abuse prompts caution. “The danger is that people’s lives can be\nchanged in bad ways because of mistakes in the technology,” Greely says.\n“The danger for the science is that it gets a black eye because of this very high profile use\nof neuroimaging that goes wrong.” Considering the long and controversial history of the\npolygraph, gradualism may be the wisest course to follow for a new diagnostic that probes\nan essential quality governing social interaction.\n \n2",
