  "passage_text": "Reading Practice\n \nThomas Harriot: The Discovery of Refraction\nA\nWhen light travels from one medium to another, it generally bends, or refracts. The law of\nrefraction gives us a way of predicting the amount of bending. Refraction has many\napplications in optics and technology. A lens uses refraction to form an image of an object\nfor many different purposes, such as magnification. A prism uses refraction to form a\nspectrum of colors from an incident beam of light. Refraction also plays an important role in\nthe formation of a mirage and other optical illusions. The law of refraction is also known as\nSnell’s Law, named after Willobrord Snell, who discovered the law in 1621. Although\nSnell’s sine law of refraction is now taught routinely in undergraduate courses, the quest for\nit spanned many centuries and involved many celebrated scientists. Perhaps the most\ninteresting thing is that the first discovery of the sine law, made by the sixteenth-century\nEnglish scientist Thomas Harriot (1560-1621), has been almost completely overlooked by\nphysicists, despite much published material describing his contribution.\nB\nA contemporary of Shakespeare, Elizabeth I, Johannes Kepler and Galilei Galileo, Thomas\nHarriot (1560-1621) was an English scientist and mathematician. His principal biographer,\nJ. W. Shirley, was quoted saying that in his time he was “England’s most profound\nmathematician, most imaginative and methodical experimental scientist”. As a\nmathematician, he contributed to the development of algebra, and introduced the symbols\nof ”>”, and ”<” for ”more than” and ”less than.” He also studied navigation and astronomy.\nOn September 17, 1607, Harriot observed a comet, later Identified as Hailey-s. With his\npainstaking observations, later workers were able to compute the comet’s orbit. Harriot was\nalso the first to use a telescope to observe the heavens in England. He made sketches of\nthe moon in 1609, and then developed lenses of increasing magnification. By April 1611,\nhe had developed a lens with a magnification of 32. Between October 17, 1610 and\nFebruary 26, 1612, he observed the moons of Jupiter, which had already discovered by\nGalileo. While observing Jupiter’s moons, he made a discovery of his own: sunspots, which\nhe viewed 199 times between December 8, 1610 and January 18, 1613. These\nobservations allowed him to figure out the sun’s period of rotation.\nC\nHe was also an early English explorer of North America. He was a friend of the English\ncourtier and explorer Sir Walter Raleigh and travelled to Virginia as a scientific observer on\na colonising expedition in 1585. On June 30, 1585, his ship anchored at Roanoke Island off\nVirginia. On shore, Harriot observed the topography, flora and fauna, made many drawings\nand maps, and met the native people who spoke a language the English called Algonquian.\nHarriot worked out a phonetic transcription of the native people’s speech sounds and\nbegan to learn the language, which enabled him to converse to some extent with other\nnatives the English encountered. Harriot wrote his report for Raleigh and published it as A\nBriefe and True Report of the New Found Land of Virginia in 1588. Raleigh gave\nHarriot his own estate in Ireland, and Harriot began a survey of Raleigh’s Irish holdings. He\nalso undertook a study of ballistics and ship design for Raleigh in advance of the Spanish\nArmada’s arrival.\n \n1\n\nD\nHarriot kept regular correspondence with other scientists and mathematicians, especially in\nEngland but also in mainland Europe, notably with Johannes Kepler. About twenty years\nbefore Snell’s discovery, Johannes Kepler (1571-1630) had also looked for the law of\nrefraction, but used the early data of Ptolemy. Unfortunately, Ptolemy’s data was in error,\nso Kepler could obtain only an approximation which he published in 1604. Kepler later tried\nto obtain additional experimental results on refraction, and corresponded with Thomas\nHarriot from 1606 to 1609 since Kepler had heard Harriot had carried out some detailed\nexperiments. In 1606, Harriot sent Kepler some tables of refraction data for different\nmaterials at a constant incident angle, but didn’t provide enough detail for the data to be\nvery useful. Kepler requested further information, but Harriot was not forthcoming, and it\nappears that Kepler eventually gave up the correspondence, frustrated with Harriot’s\nreluctance.\nE\nApart from the correspondence with Kepler, there is no evidence that Harriot ever\npublished his detailed results on refraction. His personal notes, however, reveal extensive\nstudies significantly predating those of Kepler, Snell and Descartes. Harriot carried out\nmany experiments on refraction in the 1590s, and from his notes, it is clear that he had\ndiscovered the sine law at least as early as 1602. Around 1606, he had studied dispersion\nin prisms (predating Newton by around 60 years), measured the refractive indices of\ndifferent liquids placed in a hollow glass prism, studied refraction in crystal spheres, and\ncorrectly understood refraction in the rainbow before Descartes.\nF\nAs his studies of refraction, Harriot’ s discoveries in other fields were largely unpublished\nduring his lifetime, and until this century, Harriot was known only for an account of his\ntravels in Virginia published in 1588, and for a treatise on algebra published posthumously\nin 1631. The reason why Harriot kept his results unpublished is unclear. Harriot wrote to\nKepler that poor health prevented him from providing more information, but it is also\npossible that he was afraid of the seventeenth century’s English religious establishment\nwhich was suspicious of the work carried out by mathematicians and scientists.\nG\nAfter the discovery of sunspots, Harriot’ s scientific work dwindled. The cause of his\ndiminished productivity might have been a cancer discovered on his nose. Harriot died on\nJuly 2, 1621, in London, but his story did not end with his death. Recent research has\nrevealed his wide range of interests and his genuinely original discoveries. What some\nwriters describe as his “thousands upon thousands of sheets of mathematics and of\nscientific observations” appeared to be lost until 1784, when they were found in Henry\nPercy’s country estate by one of Percy’s descendants. She gave them to Franz Xaver\nZach, her husband’s son’s tutor. Zach eventually put some of the papers in the hands of\nthe Oxford University Press, but much work was required to prepare them for publication,\nand it has never been done. Scholars have begun to study them, and an appreciation of\nHarriot’s contribution started to grow in the second half of the twentieth century. Harriot’s\nstudy of refraction is but one example where his work overlapped with independent studies\ncarried out by others in Europe, but in any historical treatment of optics his contribution\nrightfully deserves to be acknowledged.\n \n2",
