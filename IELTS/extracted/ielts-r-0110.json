  "passage_text": "Reading Practice\n \nConsecutive and Simultaneous Translation\n{A} When people are faced with a foreign-language barrier, the usual way around it is to\nfind someone to interpret or translate for them. The term ‘translation’, is the neutral term\nused for all tasks where the meaning of expressions in one language (the source language)\nis turned into the meaning of another (the ‘target’ language), whether the medium is\nspoken, written, or signed. In specific professional contexts, however, a distinction is drawn\nbetween people who work with the spoken or signed language (interpreters), and those\nwho work with the written language (translators). There are certain tasks that blur this\ndistinction, as when source speeches turned into target writing. But usually the two roles\nare seen as quite distinct, and it is unusual to find one person who is equally happy with\nboth occupations. Some writers on translation, indeed, consider the interpreting task to be\nmore suitable for extrovert personalities, and the translating task for introverts.\n{B} Interpreting is today widely known from its use in international political life. When senior\nministers from different language backgrounds meet, the television record invariably shows\na pair of interpreters hovering in the background. At major conferences, such as the United\nNations General Assembly, the presence of headphones is a clear indication that a major\nlinguistic exercise is taking place. In everyday circumstances, interpreters are frequently\nneeded, especially in cosmopolitan societies formed by new reiterations of immigrants and\nGastarbeiter. Often, the business of law courts, hospitals, local health clinics, classrooms,\nor industrial tribunals cannot be carried on without the presence of an interpreter. Given the\nimportance and frequency of this task, therefore, it is remarkable that so little study has\nbeen made of what actually happens when interpreting takes place, and of how successful\nan exercise it is.\n{C} There are two main kinds of oral translation – consecutive and simultaneous In\nconsecutive translation the translating starts after the original speech or some part of it has\nbeen completed. Here the interpreter’s strategy and the final results depend, to a great\nextent on the length of the segment to be translated. If the segment is just a sentence or\ntwo the interpreter closely follows the original speech. As often as not, however, the\ninterpreter is expected to translate a long speech which has lasted for scores of minutes or\neven longer. In this case he has to remember a great number of messages, and keep them\nin mind until he begins his translation. To make this possible the interpreter has to take\nnotes of the original messages, various systems of notation having been suggested for the\npurpose. The study of, and practice in, such notation is the integral part of the interpreter’s\ntraining as are special exercises to develop his memory.\n{D} Doubtless the recency of developments in the field partly explains this neglect. One\nprocedure, consecutive interpreting, is very old — and presumably dates from the Tower of\nBabel! Here, the interpreter translates after the speaker has finished speaking. This\napproach is widely practiced in informal situations, as well as in committees and small\nconferences. In larger and more formal settings, however, it has been generally replaced\nby simultaneous interpreting — a recent development that arose from the availability of\nmodern audiological equipment and the advent of increased international interaction\nfollowing the Second World War.\n{E} Of the two procedures, it is the second that has attracted most interest, because of the\ncomplexity of the task and the remarkable skills required. In no other context of human\n \n1\n\ncommunication is anyone routinely required to listen and speak at the same time,\npreserving an exact semantic correspondence between the two modes. Moreover, there is\ninvariably a delay of a few words between the stimulus and the response, because of the\ntime it takes to assimilate what is being said in the source language and to translate it into\nan acceptable form in the target language. This ‘ear-voice span’ is usually about 2 or 3\nseconds, but it may be as much as 10 seconds or so, if the text is complex. The brain has\nto remember what has just been said, attend to what is currently being said, and anticipate\nthe construction of what is about to be said. As you start a sentence you are taking a leap\nin the dark, you are mortgaging your grammatical future; the original sentence may\nsuddenly be turned in such a way that your translation of its end cannot easily be\nreconciled ( with your translation of its start. Great nimbleness is called for\n \n \n{F} How it is all done is not at all clear. That it is done at all is a source of some wonder,\ngiven the often lengthy periods of interpreting required, the confined environment of an\ninterpreting booth, the presence of background noise, and the awareness that major\ndecisions may depend upon the accuracy of the work. Other considerations such as\ncultural background also make it aim to pay full attention to the backgrounds of the authors\nand the recipients and to take into account differences between source and target\nlanguage.\n{G} Research projects have now begun to look at these factors – to determine, for\nexample, how far successful interpreting is affected by poor listening conditions or the\nspeed at which the source language is spoken. It seems that an input speed of between\n100 and 120 words per minute is a comfortable rate for interpreting, with an upper limit of\naround 200 w.p.m. But even small increases in speed can dramatically affect the accuracy\nof output. In one controlled study, when speeds were gradually increased in a series of\nstages from 95 to 164 w.p.m., the ear-voice span also increased with each stage, and the\namount correctly interpreted showed a clear decline. Also, as the translating load\nincreases, not only are there more errors of commission (mistranslations, cases of\nvagueness replacing precision), there are also more errors of omission, as words and\nsegments of meaning are filtered out. These are important findings, given the need for\naccuracy in international communication. What is needed is a more detailed identification of\nthe problem areas, and of the strategies speakers, listeners, and interpreters use to solve\nthem. There is an urgent need to expand what has so far been one of the most neglected\nfields of communication research. \n \n2",
