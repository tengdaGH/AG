  "passage_text": "Reading Practice\n \nA Remarkable Beetle\nMore than 4,000 species of these remarkable creatures have evolved and adapted to the\nworld’s different climates and the dung of its many animals. Australia’s native dung beetles\nare scrub and woodland dwellers, specialising in coarse marsupial droppings and avoiding\nthe soft cattle dung in which bush flies and buffalo flies breed.Some of the most remarkable\nbeetles are the dung beetles, which spend almost their whole lives eating and breeding in\ndung’.\n \nIn the early 1960s George Bornemissza, then a scientist at the Australian Government’s\npremier research organisation, the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research\nOrganisation (CSIRO), suggested that dung beetles should be introduced to Australia to\ncontrol dung-breeding flies. Between 1968 and 1982, the CSIRO imported insects from\nabout 50 different species of dung beetle, from Asia, Europe and Africa, aiming to match\nthem to different climatic zones in Australia. Of the 26 species that are known to have\nbecome successfully integrated into the local environment, only one, an African species\nreleased in northern Australia, has reached its natural boundary.\nIntroducing dung beetles into a pasture is a simple process: approximately 1,500 beetles\nare released, a handful at a time, into fresh cow pats2 in the cow pasture.\nThe beetles immediately disappear beneath the pats digging and tunnelling and, if they\nsuccessfully adapt to their new environment, soon become a permanent, self sustaining\npart of the local ecology. In time they multiply and within three or four years the benefits to\nthe pasture are obvious.\nDung beetles work from the inside of the pat so they are sheltered from predators such as\nbirds and foxes. Most species burrow into the soil and bury dung in tunnels directly\nunderneath the pats, which are hollowed out from within. Some large species originating\nfrom France excavate tunnels to a depth of approximately 30 cm below the dung pat.\nThese beetles make sausage-shaped brood chambers along the tunnels. The shallowest\ntunnels belong to a much smaller Spanish species that buries dung in chambers that hang\nlike fruit from the branches of a pear tree. South African beetles dig narrow tunnels of\napproximately 20 cm below the surface of the pat. Some surface-dwelling beetles,\nincluding a South African species, cut perfectly-shaped balls from the pat, which are rolled\naway and attached to the bases of plants.\nFor maximum dung burial in spring, summer and autumn, farmers require a variety of\nspecies with overlapping periods of activity. In the cooler environments of the state of\nVictoria, the large French species (2.5 cms long) is matched with smaller (half this size),\ntemperate-climate Spanish species. The former are slow to recover from the winter cold\nand produce only one or two generations of offspring from late spring until autumn. The\nlatter, which multiply rapidly in early spring, produce two to five generations annually. The\nSouth African ball-rolling species, being a subtropical beetle, prefers the climate of northern\nand coastal New South Wales where it commonly works with the South African tunnelling\nspecies.
