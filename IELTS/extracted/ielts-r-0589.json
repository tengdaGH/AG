Their traditional\nmedicine, which is believed to date back as far as the 13th century, was a system of\nhealing that was passed down through the generations orally. It comprised diverse\npractices and placed an emphasis on the spiritual dimension of health. Its practice included\nremedies made from herbs, and physical therapies such as massage to relieve discomfort\nin the muscles and bones.\nMaori systems for treating illness were well developed before European arrived in New\nZealand in the late 1700s: they had quite detailed knowledge of anatomy and recognition of\nthe healing properties of various plants.
