  "passage_text": "Reading Practice\n \nCollecting as a hobby\nCollecting must be one of the most varied of human activities, and it's one that many\nof us psychologists find fascinating.\nMany forms of collecting have been dignified with a technical name: an archtophilist\ncollects teddy bears, a philatelist collects postage stamps, and a deltiologist collects\npostcards. Amassing hundreds or even thousands of postcards, chocolate wrappers or\nwhatever, takes time, energy and money that could surely to much more productive use.\nAnd yet thereare millions of collectors around the world. Why do they do it?\nThere are the people who collect because they want to make money - this could be called\nan instrumental reason for collecting; that is, collecting as a means to an end. They'll look\nfor, say, antiques that they can buy cheaply and expect to be able to sell at a profit. But\nthere may well be a psychological element, too - buying cheap and selling dear can give\nthe collector a sense of triumph. And as selling online is so easy, more and more people\nare joining in.\nMany collectors collect to develop their social life, attending meetings of a group of\ncollectors and exchanging information on items.\nThis is a variant on joining a bridge club or a gym, and similarly brings them into contact\nwith like-minded people. Another motive for collecting is the desire to find something\nspecial, or a particular example of the collected item, such as a rare early recording by a\nparticular singer.\nSome may spend their whole lives in a hunt for this. Psychologically, this can give a\npurpose to a life that otherwise feels aimless.\nThere is a danger, though, that if the individual is ever lucky enough to find what they're\nlooking for, rather than celebrating their success, they may feel empty, now that the goal\nthat drove them on has gone.\nIf you think about collecting postage stamps another potential reason for it - Or, perhaps, a\nresult of collecting is its educational value. Stamp collecting opens a window to other\ncountries, and to the plants, animals, or famous people shown on their stamps.\nSimilarly, in the 19th century, many collectors amassed fossils, animals and plants from\naround the globe, and their collections provided a vast amount of information about the\nnatural world. Without those collections, our understanding would be greatly inferior to what\nit is.\nIn the past - and nowadays, too, though to a lesser extent - a popular form of collecting,\nparticularly among boys and men, was trainspotting. This might involve trying to see every\nlocomotive of a particular type, using published data that identifies each one, and ticking off\neach engine as it is seen. Trainspotters exchange information, these days often by mobile\nphone, so they can work out where to go to, to see a particular engine. As a by-product,\nmany practitioners of the hobby become very knowledgeable about railway operations, or\nthe technical specifications of different engine types.\nSimilarly, people who collect dolls may go beyond simply enlarging their collection, and\ndevelop an interest in the way that dolls are made, or the materials that are used. These\nhave changed over the centuries from the wood that was standard in 16th century Europe,\n \n1\n\nthrough the wax and porcelain of later centuries, to the plastics of today's dolls. Or\ncollectors might be inspired to study how dolls reflect notions of what children like, or ought\nto like.\nNot all collectors are interested in learning from their hobby, though, so what we might call\na psychological reason for collecting is the need for a sense of control, perhaps as a way of\ndealing with insecurity. Stamp collectors, for instance, arrange their stamps in albums,\nusually very neatly, organising their collection according to certain commonplace principles-\nperhaps by country in alphabetical order, or grouping stamps by what they depict -people,\nbirds, maps, and so on.\nOne reason, conscious or not, for what someone chooses to collect is to show the\ncollector's individualism. Someone who decides to collect something as unexpected as dog\ncollars, for instance, may be conveying their belief that they must be interesting\nthemselves. And believe it or not, there is at least one dog collar museum in existence, and\nit grew out of a personal collection.\nOf course, all hobbies give pleasure, but the common factor in collecting is usually passion:\npleasure is putting it far too mildly. More than most other hobbies, collecting can be totally\nengrossing, and can give a strong sense of personal fulfilment. To non-collectors it may\nappear an eccentric, if harmless, way of spending time, but potentially, collecting has a lot\ngoing for it. \n \n2",
