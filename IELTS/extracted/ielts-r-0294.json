  "passage_text": "Reading Practice\n \nMovie of Metropolis\nMovie of Metropolis\n…being the science-fiction film that is steadily becoming a fact\nA\nWhen German director Fritz Lang visited the United States in 1924, his first glimpse of the\ncountry was a night-time view of the New York skyline from the deck of an ocean liner.\nThis, he later recalled, was the direct inspiration for what is still probably the most\ninnovative and influential science-fiction film ever made – Metropolis.\nB\nMetropolis is a bleak vision of the early twenty-first century that is at once both chilling and\nexhilarating. This spectacular city of the future is a technological marvel of high-rise\nbuildings connected by elevated railways and airships. It’s also a world of extreme\ninequality and social division. The workers live below ground and exist as machines\nworking in an endless routine of mind-numbing 10-hour shifts while the city’s elite lead lives\nof luxury high above. Presiding over them all is the Master of Metropolis, John Fredersen,\nwhose sole satisfaction seems to lie in the exercise of power.\nC\nLang’s graphic depiction of the future is conceived in almost totally abstract terms. The\nfunction of the individual machines is never defined. Instead, this mass of dials, levers and\ngauges symbolically stands for all machines and all industry, with the workers as slave-live\nextensions of the equipment they have to operate. Lang emphasizes this idea in the\nfamous shift-change sequence at the start of the movie when the workers walk in zombie-\nlike geometric ranks, all dressed in the same dark overalls and all exhibiting the same\nbowed head and dead-eyed stare. An extraordinary fantasy sequence sees one machine\ntransformed into a huge open-jawed statue which then literally swallows them up.\nD\nOn one level the machines and the exploited workers simply provide the wealth and\nservices which allow the elite to live their lives of leisure, but on a more profound level, the\npurpose of all this demented industry is to serve itself. Power, control and the continuance\nof the system from one 10-hour shift to the next is all that counts. The city consumes\npeople and their labour and in the process becomes a perverse parody of a living being.\nE\nIt is enlightening, I think, to relate the film to the modern global economy in which\nmultinational corporations now routinely close their factories in one continent so that they\ncan take advantage of cheap labour in another. Like the industry in Metropolis, these\ncorporations’ goals of increased efficiency and profits have little to do with the welfare of\nthe majority of their employees or that of the population at large. Instead, their aims are to\nsustain the momentum of their own growth and to increase the monetary rewards to a tiny\nelite – their executives and shareholders. Fredersen himself is the essence of the big\n \n1\n\ncompany boss: Rupert Murdoch would probably feel perfectly at home in his huge\nskyscraper office with its panoramic view of the city below. And it is important that there is\nnever any mention of government in Metropolis – the whole concept is by implication\nobsolete. The only people who have power are the supreme industrialist, Fredersen, and\nhis magician/scientist cohort Rotwang.\nF\nSo far so good: when the images are allowed to speak for themselves the film is\nimpeccable both in its symbolism and in its cynicism. The problem with Metropolis is its\nsentimental story-line, which sees Freder, Fredersen’s son, instantly falling in love with the\nvisionary Maria. Maria leads an underground pseudo-religious movement and preaches\nthat the workers should not rebel but should await the arrival of a ‘Mediator’ between the\n‘Head’ (capital) and the ‘Hands’ (labour). That mediator is the ‘Heart’ – love, as embodied,\nfinally, by Freder’s love of Maria and his father’s love of him.\nG\nLang wrote the screenplay in collaboration with his then-wife Thea von Harbou. In 1933 he\nfled from the Nazis (and continued a very successful career in Hollywood). She stayed in\nGermany and continued to make films under the Hitler regime. There is a constant tension\nwithin the film between the too-tidy platitudes of von Harbou’s script and the\nuncompromisingly caustic vigour of Lang’s imagery.\nH\nTo my mind, both in Metropolis and in the real world, it’s not so much that the ‘Head’ and\n‘Hands’ require a ‘Heart’ to mediate between them but that the ‘Hands’ need to develop\ntheir own ‘Head’, their own political consciousness, and act accordingly – through the ballot\nbox, through buying power and through a sceptical resistance to the materialistic fantasies\nof the Fredersens.\nI\nAll the same, Metropolis is probably more accurate now as a representation of industrial\nand social relations than it has been at any time since its original release. And Fredersen is\ncertainly still the most potent movie symbol of the handful of elusive corporate figureheads\nwho increasingly treat the world as a Metropolis-like global village.\n \n2",
