  "passage_text": "Reading Practice\n \nTwist in the Tale\n \nFears that television and computers would kill children’s desire to read couldn’t\nhave been more wrong. With sales roaring, a new generation of authors are\npublishing’s newest and unlikeliest literary stars\n \nA Less than three years ago, doom merchants were predicting that the growth in\nvideo games and the rise of the Internet would sound the death knell for children’s\nliterature. But contrary to popular myth, children are reading more books than ever.\nA recent survey by Books Marketing found that children up to the age of 11 read on\naverage for four hours a week, particularly girls.\n \nB Moreover, the children’s book market, which traditionally was seen as a poor\ncousin to the more lucrative and successful adult market, has come into its own.\nPublishing houses are now making considerable profits on the back of new\nchildren’s books and children’s authors can now command significant advances.\n‘Children’s books are going through an incredibly fertile period,’ says Wendy\nCooling, a children’s literature consultant. ‘There’s a real buzz around them. Book\nclubs are happening, sales are good, and people are much more willing to listen to\nchildren’s authors.’\n \nC The main growth area has been the market for eight to fourteen-year-olds, and\nthere is little doubt that the boom has been fuelled by the bespectacled apprentice,\nHarry Potter. So influential has J. K. Rowling’s series of books been that they have\nhelped to make reading fashionable for pre-teens. ‘Harry made it OK to be seen on a\nbus reading a book,’ says Cooling. ‘To a child, that is important.’ The current buzz\naround the publication of the fourth Harry Potter beats anything in the world of adult\nliterature.\n \nD ‘People still tell me, “Children don’t read nowadays”,’ says David Almond, the\naward-winning author of children’s books such as Skellig. The truth is that they are\nskilled, creative readers. When 1 do classroom visits, they ask me very sophisticated\nquestions about use of language, story structure, chapters and dialogue.’ No one is\ndenying that books are competing with other forms of entertainment for children’s\nattention but it seems as though children find a special kind of mental nourishment\nwithin the printed page.\n \nE ‘A few years ago, publishers lost confidence and wanted to make books more like\ntelevision, the medium that frightened them most,’ says children’s book critic Julia\nEccleshare. ‘But books aren’t TV, and you will find that children always say that the\ngood thing about books is that you can see them in your head. Children are\ndemanding readers,’ she says. ‘If they don’t get it in two pages, they’ll drop it.’\nF No more are children’s authors considered mere sentimentalists or failed adult\nwriters. 'Some feted adult writers would kill for the sales,’ says Almond, who sold\n42,392 copies of Skellig in 1999 alone. And advances seem to be growing too: UK\npublishing outfit Orion recently negotiated a six-figure sum from US company\nScholastic for The Seeing Stone, a children's novel by Kevin Crossley-Holland, the\nmajority of which will go to the author.\n \n1\n\n \n \nG It helps that once smitten, children are loyal and even fanatical consumers. Author\nJacqueline Wilson says that children spread news of her books like a bushfire. 'My\naverage reader is a girl of ten,’ she explains. ‘They’re sociable and acquisitive. They\ncollect. They have parties - where books are a good present. If they like something,\nthey have to pass it on.’ After Rowling, Wilson is currently the best-selling children’s\nwriter, and her sales have boomed over the past three years. She has sold more than\nthree million books, but remains virtually invisible to adults, although most ten-\nyear-old girls know about her.\n \nH Children’s books are surprisingly relevant to contemporary life. Provided they are\nhandled with care, few topics are considered off-limits for children. One senses that\nchildren’s writers relish the chance to discuss the whole area of topics and\nlanguage. But Anne Fine, author of many awardwinning children’s books is\nconcerned that the British literati still ignore children’s culture. ‘It’s considered\nworthy but boring,’ she says.\n \nI T think there’s still a way to go,’ says Almond, who wishes that children’s books\nwere taken more seriously as literature. Nonetheless, he derives great satisfaction\nfrom his child readers. ‘They have a powerful literary culture,’ he says. ‘It feels as if\nyou’re able to step into the store of mythology and ancient stories that run through\nall societies and encounter the great themes: love and loss and death and\nredemption.’\n \nJ At the moment, the race is on to find the next Harry Potter. The bidding for new\nbooks at Bologna this year - the children’s equivalent of the Frankfurt Book Fair -\nwas as fierce as anything anyone has ever seen. All of which bodes well for the long-\nterm future of the market - and for children’s authors, who have traditionally suffered\nthe lowest profile in literature, despite the responsibility of their role.\n \n2",
