  "passage_text": "Reading Practice\n \nQuiet roads ahead\nThe roar of passing vehicles could soon be a thing of the past\nA. The noise produced by busy roads is a growing problem. While vehicle designers have\nworked hard to quieten engines, they have been less successful elsewhere. The sound\ncreated by the tyres on the surface of the road now accounts for more than half the noise\nthat vehicles create, and as road building and car sales continue to boom - particularly in\nAsia and the US - this is turning into a global issue.\nB. According to the World Health Organization, exposure to noise from road traffic over\nlong periods can lead to stress-related health problems. And where traffic noise exceeds a\ncertain threshold, road builders have to spend money erecting sound barriers and installing\ndouble glazing in blighted homes. Houses become harder to sell where environmental\nnoise is high, and people are not as efficient or productive at work.\nC. Already, researchers in the Netherlands - one of the most densely populated countries\nin the world - are working to develop techniques for silencing the roads. In the next five\nyears the Dutch government aims to have reduced noise levels from the country's road\nsurfaces by six decibels overall. Dutch mechanical engineer Ard Kuijpers has come up with\none of the most promising, and radical, ideas. He set out to tackle the three most important\nfactors: surface texture, hardness and ability to absorb sound.\nD. The rougher the surface, the more likely it is that a tyre will vibrate and create noise.\nRoad builders usually eliminate bumps on freshly laid asphalt with heavy rollers, but\nKuijpers has developed a method of road building that he thinks can create the ultimate\nquiet road. His secret is a special mould 3 metres wide and 50 metres long. Hot asphalt,\nmixed with small stones, is spread into the mould by a railmounted machine which flattens\nthe asphalt mix with a roller. When it sets, the 10-millimetre-thick sheet has a surface\nsmoother than anything that can be achieved by conventional methods.\nE. To optimise the performance of his road surface - to make it hard wearing yet soft\nenough to snuff out vibrations - he then adds another layer below the asphalt. This consists\nof a 30-millimetre-thick layer of rubber, mixed with stones which are larger than those in the\nlayer above. 'It's like a giant mouse mat, making the road softer,' says Kuijpers.\nF. The size of the stones used in the two layers is important, since they create pores of a\nspecific size in the road surface. Those used in the top layer are just 4 or 5 millimetres\nacross, while the ones below are approximately twice that size - about 9 millimetres.\nKuijpers says the surface can absorb any air that is passing through a tyre's tread (the\nindentations or ridges on the surface of a tyre), damping oscillations that would otherwise\ncreate noise. And in addition they make it easier for the water to drain away, which can\nmake the road safer in wet weather.\nG. Compared with the complex manufacturing process, laying the surface is quite simple. It\nemerges from the factory rolled, like a carpet, onto a drum 1.5 metres in diameter. On site,\nit is unrolled and stuck onto its foundation with bitumen. Even the white lines are applied in\nthe factory.\nH. The foundation itself uses an even more sophisticated technique to reduce noise further.\n \n1\n\nIt consists of a sound-absorbing concrete base containing flask-shaped slots up to 10\nmillimetres wide and 30 millimetres deep that are open at the top and sealed at the lower\nend. These cavities act like Helmholtz resonators - when sound waves of specific\nfrequencies enter the top of a flask, they set up resonances inside and the energy of the\nsound dissipates into the concrete as heat. The cavities play another important role: they\nhelp to drain water that seeps through from the upper surface. This flow will help flush out\nwaste material and keep the pores in the outer layers clear.\nI. Kuijpers can even control the sounds that his resonators absorb, simply by altering their\ndimensions. This could prove especially useful since different vehicles produce noise at\ndifferent frequencies. Car tyres peak at around 1000 hertz, for example, but trucks\ngenerate lower-frequency noise at around 600 hertz. By varying the size of the Kuijpers\nresonators, it is possible to control which frequencies the concrete absorbs. On large\nhighways, trucks tend to use the inside lane, so resonators here could be tuned to absorb\nsounds at around 600 hertz while those in other lanes could deal with higher frequency\nnoise from cars.\nJ. Kuijpers believes he can cut noise by five decibels compared to the quietest of today's\nroads. He has already tested a l00-metre-long section of his road on a motorway near\nApeldoorn, and Dutch construction company Heijmans is discussing the location of the next\nroll-out road with the country's government. The success of Kuijpers' design will depend on\nhow much it eventually costs. But for those affected by traffic noise there is hope of quieter\ntimes ahead.\n \n2",
