  "passage_text": "Reading Practice\n \nEducation Philosophy\nA\nAlthough we lack accurate statistics about child mortality in the pre-industrial period, we do\nhave evidence that in the 1660s, the mortality rate for children who died within 14 days of\nbirth was as much as 30 per cent. Nearly all families suffered some premature death. Since\nall parents expected to bury some of their children, they found it difficult to invest in their\nnewborn children. Moreover, to protect themselves from the emotional consequences of\nchildren’s death, parents avoided making any emotional commitment to an infant. It is no\nwonder that we find mothers leave their babies in gutters or refer to the death in the same\nparagraph with reference to pickles.\nB\nThe 18th century witnessed the transformation from an agrarian economy to an industrial\none, one of the vital social changes taking place in the Western world. An increasing\nnumber of people moved from their villages and small towns to big cities where life was\nquite different. Social supports which had previously existed in smaller communities were\nreplaced by ruthless problems such as poverty, crime, substandard housing and disease.\nDue to the need for additional income to support the family, young children from the\npoorest families were forced into early employment and thus their childhood became\npainfully short. Children as young as 7 might be required to work full-time, subjected to\nunpleasant and unhealthy circumstances, from factories to prostitution. Although such a\nrole has disappeared in most wealthy countries, the practice of childhood employment still\nremains a staple in underdeveloped countries and rarely disappeared entirely.\nC\nThe lives of children underwent a drastic change during the 1800s in the United States.\nPreviously, children from both rural and urban families were expected to participate in\neveryday labour due to the bulk of manual hard working. Nevertheless, thanks to the\ntechnological advances of the mid-1800s, coupled with the rise of the middle class and\nredefinition of roles of family members, work and home became less synonymous over\ntime. People began to purchase toys and books for their children. When the country\ndepended more upon machines, children in rural and urban areas, were less likely to be\nrequired to work at home. Beginning from the Industrial Revolution and rising slowly over\nthe course of the 19th century, this trend increased exponentially after civil war. John\nLocke, one of the most influential writers of his period, created the first clear and\ncomprehensive statement of the ‘environmental position’ that family education determines\na child’s life, and via this, he became the father of modem learning theory. During the\ncolonial period, his teachings about child care gained a lot of recognition in America.\nD\nAccording to Jean Jacques Rousseau, who lived in an era of the American and French\nRevolution, people were ‘noble savages’ in the original state of nature, meaning they are\ninnocent, free and uncorrupted. In 1762, Rousseau wrote a famous novel Emile to convey\nhis educational philosophy through a story of a boy’s education from infancy to adult-hood.\nThis work was based on his extensive observation of children and adolescents, their\n \n1\n\nindividuality, his developmental theory and on the memories of his own childhood. He\ncontrasts children with adults and describes their age-specific characteristics in terms of\nhistorical perspective and developmental psychology. Johan Heinrich Pestalozzi, living\nduring the early stages of the Industrial Revolution, sought to develop schools to nurture\nchildren’s all-round development. He agreed with Rousseau that humans are naturally\ngood but were spoiled by a corrupt society. His approach to teaching consists of the\ngeneral and special methods, and his theory was based upon establishing an emotionally\nhealthy homelike learning environment, which had to be in place before more specific\ninstructions occurred.\nE\nOne of the best-documented cases of Pestalozzi’s theory concerned a so-called feral child\nnamed Victor, who was captured in a small town in the south of France in 1800.\nPrepubescent, mute, naked, and perhaps 11 or 12 years old, Victor had been seen\nforaging for food in the gardens of the locals in the area and sometimes accepted people’s\ndirect offers of food before his final capture. Eventually, he was brought to Paris and\nexpected to answer some profound questions about the nature of human, but that goal was\nquashed very soon. A young physician Jean Marc Gaspard Itard was optimistic about the\nfuture of Victor and initiated a five-year education plan to civilise him and teach him to\nspeak. With a subsidy from the government, Itard recruited a local woman Madame Guerin\nto assist him to provide a semblance of a home for Victor, and he spent an enormous\namount of time and effort working with Victor. Itard’s goal to teach Victor the basics of\nspeech could never be fully achieved, but Victor had learnt some elementary forms of\ncommunication.\nF\nAlthough other educators were beginning to recognise the simple truth embedded in\nRousseau’s philosophy, it is not enough to identify the stages of children’s development\nalone. There must be certain education which had to be geared towards those stages. One\nof the early examples was the invention of kindergarten, which was a word and a\nmovement created by a German-born educator, Friedrich Froebel in 1840. Froebel placed\na high value on the importance of play in children’s learning. His invention would spread\naround the world eventually in a verity of forms. Froebel’s ideas were inspired through his\ncooperation with Johann Heinrich Pestalozzi. Froebel didn’t introduce the notion of\nkindergarten until 58 years old, and he had been a teacher for four decades. The notion\nwas a haven and a preparation for children who were about to enter the regimented\neducational system. The use of guided or structured play was a cornerstone of his\nkindergarten education because he believed that play was the most significant aspect of\ndevelopment at this time of life. Play served as a mechanism for a child to grow emotionally\nand to achieve a sense of self-worth. Meanwhile, teachers served to organise materials\nand a structured environment in which each child, as an individual, could achieve these\ngoals. When Froebel died in 1852, dozens of kindergartens had been created in Germany.\nKindergartens began to increase in Europe, and the movement eventually reached and\nflourished in the United States in the 20th century.\n \n2",
