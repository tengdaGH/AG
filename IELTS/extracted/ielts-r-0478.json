  "passage_text": "Reading Practice\n \nThe Future of fish\nThe face of the ocean has changed completely since the first commercial fishers cast their\nnets and hooks over a thousand years ago. Fisheries intensified over the centuries, but\neven by the nineteenth century it was still felt, justifiably, that the plentiful resources of the\nsea were for the most part beyond the reach of fishing, and so there was little need to\nrestrict fishing or create protected areas. The twentieth century heralded an escalation in\nfishing intensity that is unprecedented in the history of the oceans, and modern fishing\ntechnologies leave fish no place to hide. Today, the only refuges from fishing are those we\ndeliberately create. Unhappily, the sea trails far behind the land in terms of the area and\nthe quality of protection given.\nFor centuries, as fishing and commerce have expanded, we have held onto the notion that\nthe sea is different from the land. We still view it as a place where people and nations\nshould be free to come and go at will, as well as somewhere that should be free for us to\nexploit. Perhaps this is why we have been so reluctant to protect the sea. On land,\nprotected areas have proliferated as human populations have grown. Here, compared to\nthe sea, we have made greater headway in our struggle to maintain the richness and\nvariety of wildlife and landscape. Twelve percent of the world’s land is now contained in\nprotected areas, whereas the corresponding figure for the sea is but three-fifths of one\npercent. Worse still, most marine protected areas allow some fishing to continue. Areas off-\nlimits to all exploitation cover something like one five-thousandth of the total area of the\nworld’s seas.\nToday, we are belatedly coming to realise that ‘natural refuges’ from fishing have played a\ncritical role in sustaining fisheries, and maintaining healthy and diverse marine ecosystems.\nThis does not mean that marine reserves can rebuild fisheries on their own - other\nmanagement measures are also required for that. However, places that are off-limits to\nfishing constitute the last and most important part of our package of reform for fisheries\nmanagement. They underpin and enhance all our other efforts. There are limits to\nprotection though.\nReserves cannot bring back what has died out. We can never resurrect globally extinct\nspecies, and restoring locally extinct animals may require reintroductions from elsewhere, if\nnatural dispersal from remaining populations is insufficient. We are also seeing, in cases\nsuch as northern cod in Canada, that fishing can shift marine ecosystems into different\nstates, where different mixes of species prevail. In many cases, these species are less\ndesirable, since the prime fishing targets have gone or are much reduced in numbers, and\nchanges may be difficult to reverse, even with a complete moratorium on fishing. The\nMediterranean sailed by Ulysses, the legendary king of ancient Greece, supported\nabundant monk seals, loggerhead turtles and porpoises. Their disappearance through\nhunting and overfishing has totally restructured food webs, and recovery is likely to be\nmuch harder to achieve than their destruction was. This means that the sooner we act to\nprotect marine life, the more certain will be our success.\nTo some people, creating marine reserves is an admission of failure. According to their\nlogic, reserves should not be necessary if we have done our work properly in managing the\nuses we make of the sea. Many fisheries managers are still wedded to the idea that one\nday their models will work, and politicians will listen to their advice. Just give the approach\n \n1\n\ntime, and success will be theirs. How much time have we got? This approach has been\ntried and refined for the last 50 years. There have been few successes which to feather the\nmanagers’ caps, but a growing litany of failure. The Common Fisheries Policy,\nthe European Union’s instrument for the management of fisheries and aquaculture,\nexemplifies the worst pitfalls: flawed models, flawed advice, watered-down\nrecommendations from government bureaucrats and then the disregard of much of this\nadvice by politicians. When it all went wrong, as it inevitably had to, Europe sent its boats\nto other countries in order to obtain fish for far less than they were actually worth.\nWe are squandering the wealth of oceans. If we don’t break out of this cycle of failure,\nhumanity will lose a key source of protein, and much more besides. Disrupting natural\necosystem processes, such as water purification, nutrient cycling, and carbon storage,\ncould have ramifications for human life itself. We can go a long way to avoiding this\ncatastrophic mistake with simple common sense management. Marine reserves lie at the\nheart of the reform. But they will not be sufficient if they are implemented only here and\nthere to shore up the crumbling edifice of the ‘rational fisheries management’ envisioned by\nscientists in the 1940s and 1950s. They have to be placed centre stage as a fundamental\nunderpinning for everything we do in the oceans. Reserves are a first resort, not a final\nresort when all else fails.\n \n2",
