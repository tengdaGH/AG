  "passage_text": "Reading Practice\n \nWhy pagodas don't fall down\nIn a land swept by typhoons and shaken by earthquakes, how have Japan's tallest and\nseemingly flimsiest old buildings - 500 or so wooden pagodas - remained standing for\ncenturies? Records show that only two have collapsed during the past 1400 years. Those\nthat have disappeared were destroyed by fire as a result of lightning or civil war. The\ndisastrous Hanshin earthquake in 1995 killed 6,400 people, toppled elevated highways,\nflattened office blocks and devastated the port area of Kobe. Yet it left the magnificent five-\nstorey pagoda at the Toji temple in nearby Kyoto unscathed, though it levelled a number of\nbuildings in the neighbourhood.\nJapanese scholars have been mystified for ages about why these tall, slender buildings are\nso stable. It was only thirty years ago that the building industry felt confident enough to\nerect office blocks of steel and reinforced concrete that had more than a dozen floors. With\nits special shock absorbers to dampen the effect of sudden sideways movements from an\nearthquake, the thirty-six-storey Kasumigaseki building in central Tokyo - Japan's first\nskyscraper - was considered a masterpiece of modern engineering when it was built in\n1968.\nYet in 826, with only pegs and wedges to keep his wooden structure upright, the master\nbuilder Kobodaishi had no hesitation in sending his majestic Toji pagoda soaring fifty-five\nmetres into the sky - nearly half as high as the Kasumigaseki skyscraper built some eleven\ncenturies later. Clearly, Japanese carpenters of the day knew a few tricks about allowing a\nbuilding to sway and settle itself rather than fight nature's forces. But what sort of tricks?\nThe multi-storey pagoda came to Japan from China in the sixth century. As in China, they\nwere first introduced with Buddhism and were attached to important temples. The Chinese\nbuilt their pagodas in brick or stone, with inner staircases, and used them in later centuries\nmainly as watchtowers. When the pagoda reached Japan, however, its architecture was\nfreely adapted to local conditions - they were built less high, typically five rather than nine\nstoreys, made mainly of wood and the staircase was dispensed with because the Japanese\npagoda did not have any practical use but became more of an art object. Because of the\ntyphoons that batter Japan in the summer, Japanese builders learned to extend the eaves\nof buildings further beyond the walls. This prevents rainwater gushing down the walls.\nPagodas in China and Korea have nothing like the overhang that is found on pagodas in\nJapan. \nThe roof of a Japanese temple building can be made to overhang the sides of the structure\nby fifty per cent or more of the building's overall width. For the same reason, the builders\nof Japanese pagodas seem to have further increased their weight by choosing to cover\nthese extended eaves not with the porcelain tiles of many Chinese pagodas but with much\nheavier earthenware tiles.\nBut this does not totally explain the great resilience of Japanese pagodas. Is the answer\nthat, like a tall pine tree, the Japanese pagoda - with its massive trunk-like central pillar\nknown as shinbashira - simply flexes and sways during a typhoon or earthquake? For\ncenturies, many thought so. But the answer is not so simple because the startling thing is\nthat the shinbashira actually carries no load at all. In fact, in some pagoda designs, it does\nnot even rest on the ground, but is suspended from the top of the pagoda - hanging loosely\ndown through the middle of the building. The weight of the building is supported entirely by\n \n1\n\ntwelve outer and four inner columns.\nAnd what is the role of the shinbashira, the central pillar? The best way to understand the\nshinbashira's role is to watch a video made by Shuzo Ishida, a structural engineer at\nKyoto Institute of Technology. Mr Ishida, known to his students as 'Professor Pagoda'\nbecause of his passion to understand the pagoda, has built a series of models and tested\nthem on a 'shake-table' in his laboratory. In short, the shinbashira was acting like an\nenormous stationary pendulum. The ancient craftsmen, apparently without the assistance\nof very advanced mathematics, seemed to grasp the principles that were, more than a\nthousand years later, applied in the construction of Japan's first skyscraper. What those\nearly craftsmen had found by trial and error was that under pressure a pagoda's loose\nstack of floors could be made to slither to and fro independent of one another. Viewed from\nthe side, the pagoda seemed to be doing a snake dance - with each consecutive floor\nmoving in the opposite direction to its neighbours above and below. The shinbashira,\nrunning up through a hole in the centre of the building, constrained individual storeys from\nmoving too far because, after moving a certain distance, they banged into it, transmitting\nenergy away along the column.\nAnother strange feature of the Japanese pagoda is that, because the building tapers, with\neach successive floor plan being smaller than the one below, none of the vertical pillars\nthat carry the weight of the building is connected to its corresponding pillar above. In other\nwords, a five-storey pagoda contains not even one pillar that travels right up through the\nbuilding to carry the structural loads from the top to the bottom. More surprising is the fact\nthat the individual storeys of a Japanese pagoda, unlike their counterparts elsewhere, are\nnot actually connected to each other. They are simply stacked one on top of another like a\npile of hats. Interestingly, such a design would not be permitted under current Japanese\nbuilding regulations.\nAnd the extra-wide eaves? Think of them as a tightrope walker's balancing pole. The\nbigger the mass at each end of the pole, the easier it is for the tightrope walker to maintain\nhis or her balance. The same holds true for a pagoda. 'With the eaves extending out on all\nsides like balancing poles,' says Mr Ishida, 'the building responds to even the most\npowerful jolt of an earthquake with a graceful swaying, never an abrupt shaking.' Here\nagain, Japanese master builders of a thousand years ago anticipated concepts of modern\nstructural engineering.\n \n2",
