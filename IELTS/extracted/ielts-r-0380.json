  "passage_text": "Reading Practice\n \nRural transport plan of “Practical action”\nFor more than 40 years, Practical Action has worked with poor communities to identify the\ntypes of transport that work best, taking into consideration culture, needs and skills. With\nour technical and practical support, isolated rural communities can design, build and\nmaintain their own solutions.\n \nA\n  \nWhilst the focus of National Development Plans in the transport sector lies heavily in the\nareas of extending road networks and bridges, there are still major gaps identified in\naddressing the needs of poorer communities. There is a need to develop and promote the\nsustainable use of alternative transport systems and intermediate means of transportation\n(IMTs) that complement the linkages of poor people with road networks and other socio-\neconomic infrastructures to improve their livelihoods.\nB\nOn the other hand, the development of all weathered roads (only 30 percent of the rural\npopulation have access to this so far) and motorable bridges are very costly for a country\nwith a small and stagnant economy. In addition, these interventions are not always\nfavourable in all geographical contexts environmentally, socially and economically. More\nthan 60 percent of the network is concentrated in the lowland areas of the country.\nAlthough there are a number of alternative ways by which transportation and mobility\nneeds of rural communities in the hills can be addressed, a lack of clear government focus\nand policies, lack of fiscal and economic incentives, lack of adequate technical knowledge\nand manufacturing capacities have led to under-development of this alternative transport\nsub-sector including the provision of IMTs.\nC\nOne of the major causes of poverty is isolation. Improving the access and mobility of the\nisolated poor paves the way for access to markets, services and opportunities. By\nimproving transport poorer people are able to access markets where they can buy or sell\ngoods for income, and make better use of essential services such as health and education.\nNo proper roads or vehicles mean women and children are forced to spend many hours\neach day attending to their most basic needs, such as collecting water and firewood. This\nvaluable time could be used to tend crops, care for the family, study or develop small\nbusiness ideas to generate much-needed income.\nRoad building\nD\nWithout roads, rural communities are extremely restricted. Collecting water and firewood,\nand going to local markets is a huge task, therefore it is understandable that the\nconstruction of roads is a major priority for many rural communities. Practical Action is\nhelping to improve rural access/transport infrastructures through the construction and\nrehabilitation of short rural roads, small bridges, culverts and other transport-related\n \n1\n\nfunctions. The aim is to use methods that encourage community-driven development. This\nmeans villagers can improve their own lives through better access to markets, health care,\neducation and other economic and social opportunities, as well as bringing improved\nservices and supplies to the now-accessible villages.\nDriving forward new ideas\nE\nPractical Action and the communities we work with are constantly crafting and honing new\nideas to help poor people. Cycle trailers have practical business use too, helping people\ncarry their goods, such as vegetables and charcoal, to markets for sale. Not only that, but\nthose on the poverty-line can earn a decent income by making, maintaining and operating\nbicycle taxis. With Practical Action’s know-how, Sri Lanka communities have been able to\nstart a bus service and maintain the roads along which it travels. The impact has been\nremarkable. This service has put an end to rural people’s social isolation. Quick and\naffordable, it gives them a reliable way to travel to the nearest town; and now their children\ncan get an education, making it far more likely they’ll find a path out of poverty. Practical\nAction is also an active member of many national and regional networks through which\nexchange of knowledge and advocating based on action research are carried out and one\nconspicuous example is the Lanka Organic Agriculture Movement.\nSky-scraping transport system\nF\nFor people who live in remote, mountainous areas, getting food to market in order to earn\nenough money to survive is a serious issue. The hills are so steep that travelling down\nthem is dangerous. A porter can help but they are expensive, and it would still take hours\nor even a day. The journey can take so long that their goods start to perish and become\nworthless and less. Practical Action has developed an ingenious solution called an aerial\nropeway. It can either operate by gravitation force or with the use of external power. The\nropeway consists of two trolleys rolling over support tracks connected to a control cable in\nthe middle which moves in a traditional flywheel system. The trolley at the top is loaded\nwith goods and can take up to 120kg. This is pulled down to the station at the bottom,\neither by the force of gravity or by an external power. The other trolley at the bottom is,\ntherefore, pulled upwards automatically. The external power can be produced by a micro-\nhydro system if access to an electricity grid is not an option.\nBringing people on board\nG\nPractical Action developed a two-wheeled iron trailer that can be attached (via a hitch\nbehind the seat) to a bicycle and be used to carry heavy loads (up to around 200 kgs) of\nfood, water or even passengers. People can now carry three times as much as before and\nstill pedal the bicycle. The cycle trailers are used for transporting goods by local producers,\nas ambulances, as mobile shops, and even as mobile libraries. They are made in small\nvillage workshops from iron tubing, which is cut, bent, welded and drilled to make the frame\nand wheels. Modifications are also carried out to the trailers in these workshops at the\nrequest of the buyers. The two-wheeled ‘ambulance’ is made from moulded metal, with\nstandard rubber-tyred wheels. The “bed” section can be padded with cushions to make the\n \n2\n\npatient comfortable, while the “seat” section allows a family member to attend to the patient\nduring transit. A dedicated bicycle is needed to pull the ambulance trailer, so that other\ncommunity members do not need to go without the bicycles they depend on in their daily\nlives. A joining mechanism allows for easy removal and attachment. In response to user\ncomments, a cover has been designed that can be added to give protection to the patient\nand attendant in poor weather. Made of treated cotton, the cover is durable and waterproof.\n \n3",
