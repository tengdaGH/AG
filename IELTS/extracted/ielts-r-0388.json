  "passage_text": "Reading Practice\n \nSecrets of the Forest\nA\nIn 1942 Allan R Holmberg, a doctoral student in anthropology from Yale University, USA,\nventured deep into the jungle of Bolivian Amazonia and searched out an isolated band of\nSiriono Indians. The Siriono, Holmberg later wrote, led a \"strikingly backward” existence.\nTheir villages were little more than clusters of thatched huts. Life itself was a perpetual and\npunishing search for food: some families grew manioc and other starchy crops in small\ngarden plots cleared from the forest, while other members of the tribe scoured the country\nfor small game and promising fish holes. When local resources became depleted, the tribe\nmoved on.\nAs for technology, Holmberg noted, the Siriono \"may be classified among the most\nhandicapped peoples of the world\". Other than bows, arrows and crude digging sticks, the\nonly tools the Siriono seemed to possess were \"two machetes worn to the size of pocket-\nknives\".\nB\nAlthough the lives of the Siriono have changed in the intervening decades, the image of\nthem as Stone Age relics has endured. Indeed, in many respects the Siriono epitomize the\npopular conception of life in Amazonia. To casual observers, as well as to influential natural\nscientists and regional planners, the luxuriant forests of Amazonia seem ageless,\nunconquerable, a habitat totally hostile to human civilization. The apparent simplicity of\nIndian ways of life has been judged an evolutionary adaptation to forest ecology, living\nproof that Amazonia could not - and cannot - sustain a more complex society.\nArchaeological traces of far more elaborate cultures have been dismissed as the ruins of\ninvaders from outside the region, abandoned to decay in the uncompromising tropical\nenvironment.\nC\nThe popular conception of Amazonia and its native residents would be enormously\nconsequential if it were true. But the human history of Amazonia in the past 11,000 years\nbetrays that view as myth. Evidence gathered in recent years from anthropology and\narchaeology indicates that the region has supported a series of indigenous cultures for\neleven thousand years; an extensive network of complex societies - some with populations\nperhaps as large as 100,000 - thrived there for more than 1,000 years before the arrival of\nEuropeans. (Indeed, some contemporary tribes, including the Siriono, still live among the\nearthworks of earlier cultures.) Far from being evolutionarily retarded, prehistoric\nAmazonian people developed technologies and cultures that were advanced for their time.\nIf the lives of Indians today seem \"primitive\", the appearance is not the result of some\nenvironmental adaptation or ecological barrier; rather it is a comparatively recent\nadaptation to centuries of economic and political pressure. Investigators who argue\notherwise have unwittingly projected the present onto the past.\nD\nThe evidence for a revised view of Amazonia will take many people by surprise. Ecologists\n \n1\n\nhave assumed that tropical ecosystems were shaped entirely by natural forces and they\nhave focused their research on habitats they believe have escaped human influence. But\nas the University of Florida ecologist, Peter Feinsinger, has noted, an approach that leaves\npeople out of the equation is no longer tenable. The archaeological evidence shows that\nthe natural history of Amazonia is to a surprising extent tied to the activities of its prehistoric\ninhabitants.\nE\nThe realization comes none too soon. In June 1992 political and environmental leaders\nfrom across the world met in Rio de Janeiro to discuss how developing countries can\nadvance their economies without destroying their natural resources. The challenge is\nespecially difficult in Amazonia. Because the tropical forest has been depicted as\necologically unfit for large-scale human occupation, some environmentalists have opposed\ndevelopment of any kind.\nIronically, one major casualty of that extreme position has been the environment itself.\nWhile policy makers struggle to define and implement appropriate legislation, development\nof the most destructive kind has continued apace over vast areas.\nF\n \nThe other major casualty of the \"naturalism\" of environmental scientists has been the\nindigenous Amazonians, whose habits of hunting, fishing, and slash-and-burn cultivation\noften have been represented as harmful to the habitat. In the clash between\nenvironmentalists and developers, the Indians, whose presence is in fact crucial to the\nsurvival of the forest, have suffered the most. The new understanding of the pre-history of\nAmazonia, however, points toward a middle ground. Archaeology makes clear that with\njudicious management selected parts of the region could support more people than anyone\nthought before. The long- buried past, it seems, offers hope for the future.\n \n2",
