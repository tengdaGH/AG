  "passage_text": "Reading Practice\n \n \nThe Intersection of Health Sciences and Geography\n \nA While many diseases that affect humans have been eradicated due to improvements in\nvaccinations and the availability of healthcare, there are still areas around the world where\ncertain health issues are more prevalent. In a world that is far more globalised than ever\nbefore, people come into contact with one another through travel and living closer and\ncloser to each other. As a result, super-viruses and other infections resistant to antibiotics\nare becoming more and more common.\n \nB Geography can often play a very large role in the health concerns of certain populations.\nFor instance, depending on where you live, you will not have the same health concerns as\nsomeone who lives in a different geographical region. Perhaps one of the most obvious\nexamples of this idea is malaria-prone areas, which are usually tropical regions that foster\na warm and damp environment in which the mosquitos that can give people this disease\ncan grew. Malaria is much less of a problem in high-altitude deserts, for instance.\n \nC In some countries, geographical factors influence the health and well-being of the\npopulation in very obvious ways. In many large cities, the wind is not strong enough to\nclear the air of the massive amounts of smog and pollution that cause asthma, lung\nproblems, eyesight issues and more in the people who live there. Part of the problem is, of\ncourse, the massive number of cars being driven, in addition to factories that run on coal\npower. The rapid industrialisation of some countries in recent years has also led to the\ncutting down of forests to allow for the expansion of big cities, which makes it even harder\nto fight the pollution with the fresh air that is produced by plants.\n \nD It is in situations like these that the field of health geography comes into its own. It is an\nincreasingly important area of study in a world where diseases like polio are re-emerging,\nrespiratory diseases continue to spread, and malaria-prone areas are still fighting to find a\nbetter cure. Health geography is the combination of, on the one hand, knowledge regarding\ngeography and methods used to analyse and interpret geographical information, and on\nthe other, the study of health, diseases and healthcare practices around the world. The aim\nof this hybrid science is to create solutions for common geography-based health problems.\nWhile people will always be prone to illness, the study of how geography affects our health\ncould lead to the eradication of certain illnesses, and the prevention of others in the future.\nBy understanding why and how we get sick, we can change the way we treat illness and\ndisease specific to certain geographical locations.\n \nE The geography of disease and ill health analyses the frequency with which certain\ndiseases appear in different parts of the world, and overlays the data with the geography of\nthe region, to see if there could be a correlation between the two. Health geographers also\nstudy factors that could make certain individuals or a population more likely to be taken ill\nwith a specific health concern or disease, as compared with the population of another area.\nHealth geographers in this field are usually trained as healthcare workers, and have an\nunderstanding of basic epidemiology as it relates to the spread of diseases among the\npopulation.\nF Researchers study the interactions between humans and their environment that could\nlead to illness (such as asthma in places with high levels of pollution) and work to create a\nclear way of categorising illnesses, diseases and epidemics into local and global scales.\nHealth geographers can map the spread of illnesses and attempt to identify the reasons\n \n1\n\n \nbehind an increase or decrease in illnesses, as they work to find a way to halt the further\nspread or re-emergence of diseases in vulnerable populations.\n \nG The second subcategory of health geography is the geography of healthcare provision.\nThis group studies the availability (of lack thereof) of healthcare resources to individuals\nand populations around the world. In both developed and developing nations there is often\na very large discrepancy between the options available to people in different social classes,\nincome brackets, and levels of education. Individuals working in the area of the geography\nof healthcare provision attempt to assess the levels of healthcare in the area (for instance,\nit may be very difficult for people to get medical attention because there is a mountain\nbetween their village and the nearest hospital). These researchers are on the frontline of\nmaking recommendations regarding policy to international organisations, local government\nbodies and others.\nH The field of health geography is often overlooked, but it constitutes a huge area of need\nin the fields of geography and healthcare. If we can understand how geography affects our\nhealth no matter where in the world we are located, we can better treat disease, prevent\nillness, and keep people safe and well.\n \n2",
