  "passage_text": "Reading Practice\n \n \nVote For Women\nThe suffragette movement, which campaigned for votes for women in the early twentieth\ncentury, is most commonly associated with the Pankhurst family and militant acts of varying\ndegrees of violence. The Museum of London has drawn on its archive collection to convey\na fresh picture with its exhibition\nThe Purple, White and Green: Suffragettes in London 1906-14.\nThe name is a reference to the colour scheme that the Women’s Social and Political Union\n(WSPU) created to give the movement a uniform, nationwide image. By doing so, it\nbecame one of the first groups to project a corporate identity, and it is this advanced\nmarketing strategy, along with the other organisational and commercial achievements of\nthe WSPU, to which the exhibition is devoted.\nFormed in 1903 by the political campaigner Mrs Emmeline Pankhurst and her daughters\nChristabel and Sylvia, the WSPU began an educated campaign to put women’s suffrage on\nthe political agenda. New Zealand, Australia and parts of the United States had already\nenfranchised women, and growing numbers of their British counterparts wanted the same\nopportunity.\nWith their slogan ‘Deeds not words’, and the introduction of the colour scheme, the WSPU\nsoon brought the movement the cohesion and focus it had previously lacked.\nMembership grew rapidly as women deserted the many other, less directed, groups and\njoined it. By 1906 the WSPU headquarters, called the Women’s Press Shop, had been\nestablished in Charing Cross Road and in spite of limited communications (no radio or\ntelevision, and minimal use of the telephone) the message had spread around the country,\nwith members and branch officers stretching to as far away as Scotland.\nThe newspapers produced by the WSPU, first Votes for Women and later The Suffragette,\nplayed a vital role in this communication. Both were sold throughout the country and proved\nan invaluable way of informing members of meetings, marches, fund-raising events and the\nlatest news and views on the movement.\nEqually importantly for a rising political group, the newspaper returned a profit. This was\npartly because advertising space was bought in the paper by large department stores such\nas Selfridges, and jewellers such as Mappin & Webb. These two, together with other like-\nminded commercial enterprises sympathetic to the cause, had quickly identified a direct\nway to reach a huge market of women, many with money to spend.\nThe creation of the colour scheme provided another money-making opportunity which the\nWSPU was quick to exploit. The group began to sell playing cards, board games,\nChristmas and greeting cards, and countless other goods, all in the purple, white and green\ncolours. In 1906 such merchandising of a corporate identity was a new marketing concept.\nBut the paper and merchandising activities alone did not provide sufficient funds for the\nWSPU to meet organisational costs, so numerous other fund-raising activities combined to\nfill the coffers of the ‘war chest’. The most notable of these was the Woman’s Exhibition,\nwhich took place in 1909 in a Knightsbridge ice-skating rink, and in 10 days raised the\n \n1\n\nequivalent of £250,000 today.\nThe Museum of London’s exhibition is largely visual, with a huge number of items on show.\nAgainst a quiet background hum of street sounds, copies of The Suffragette, campaign\nbanners and photographs are all on display, together with one of Mrs Pankhurst’s shoes\nand a number of purple, white and green trinkets.\nPhotographs depict vivid scenes of a suffragette’s life: WSPU members on a self-\nproclaimed ‘monster’ march, wearing their official uniforms of a white frock decorated with\npurple, white and green accessories; women selling The Suffragette at street corners, or\nchalking up pavements with details of a forthcoming meeting.\nWindows display postcards and greeting cards designed by women artists for the\nmovement, and the quality of the artwork indicates the wealth of resources the WSPU\ncould call on from its talented members.\nVisitors can watch a short film made up of old newsreels and cinema material which clearly\nreveals the political mood of the day towards the suffragettes. The programme begins with\na short film devised by the ‘antis’ - those opposed to women having the vote -depicting a\nsuffragette as a fierce harridan bullying her poor, abused husband.\nOriginal newsreel footage shows the suffragette Emily Wilding Davison throwing herself\nunder King George V’s horse at a famous race-\n \nAlthough the exhibition officially charts the years 1906 to 1914, graphic display boards\noutlining the bills of enfranchisement of 1918 and 1928, which gave the adult female\npopulace of Britain the vote, show what was achieved. It demonstrates how advanced the\nsuffragettes were in their thinking, in the marketing of their campaign, and in their work as\nshrewd and skilful image-builders. It also conveys a sense of the energy and ability the\nsuffragettes brought to their fight for freedom and equality.
