  "passage_text": "Reading Practice\n \nThe Bite That Heat\nScientists are unlocking the medical potential of venom.\n \nA Michael decided to go for a swim. He was on vacation with his family in Guerrero,\nMexico, and it was hotter than blazes. He grabbed his swimming trunks from where they’d\nbeen drying on a chair, slid them on, and jumped into the pool. Instead of cool relief, a\nburning pain ripped through the back of his thigh. Tearing off his trunks, he leaped naked\nfrom the pool, his leg on fire. Behind him a small, ugly, yellow creature was treading water.\nHe scooped it into a Tupperware container, and the caretaker of the house rushed him to\nthe local Red Cross facility, where doctors immediately identified his attacker: a bark\nscorpion, Centruroides sculpturatus, one of the most venomous species in North America.\nThe fierce pain from a sting is typically followed by what feels like electric shocks racking\nthe body. Occasionally victims die.\nB Luckily for Michael (who asked me not to give his Ml name), the bark scorpion is\ncommon in the area, and antivenom was readily available. He had an injection and was\nreleased a few hours later. In about 30 hours the pain was gone. What happened next\ncould not have been predicted. For eight years Michael had endured a condition called\nankylosing spondylitis, a chronic autoimmune disease of the skeleton, a sort of spinal\narthritis. No one knows what triggers it. In the worst cases the spine may fuse, leaving the\npatient forever stooped and in anguish. “My back hurt every morning, and during bad flare-\nups it was so horrible I couldn’t even walk,” he says.\n \nC But days after the the scorpion sting, the pain went away, and now, two years later, he\nremains essentially pain free and off most of his medications. As a doctor himself, Michael\nis cautious about overstating the role of the scorpion’s venom in his remission. Still, he\nsays, “if my pain came back, I’d let that scorpion sting me again.” Venom-the stuff that drips\nfrom the fangs and stingers of creatures lurking on the hiking trail or hiding in the cellar or\nunder the woodpile—is nature’s most efficient killer. Venom is exquisitely honed to stop a\nbody in its tracks. The complex soup swirls with toxic proteins and peptides——short\nstrings of amino acids similar to proteins. The molecules may have different targets and\neffects, but they work synergistically for the mightiest punch. Some go for the nervous\nsystem, paralyzing by blocking messages between nerves and muscle. Some eat away at\nmolecules so that cells and tissues collapse. Venom can kill by clotting blood and stopping\nthe heart or by preventing clotting and triggering a killer bleed.\nD All venom is multifaceted and multitasking. (The difference between venom and poison is\nthat venom is injected, or dibbled, into victims by way of specialized body parts, and poison\nis ingested.) Dozens, even hundreds, of toxins can be delivered in a single bite, some with\nredundant jobs and others with unique ones. In the evolutionary arms race between\npredator and prey, weapons and defenses are constantly tweaked. Drastically potent\nconcoctions can result: Imagine administering poison to an adversary, then jabbing him\nwith a knife, then finishing him off with a bullet to the head. That’s venom at work.\nE Ironically, the properties that make venom deadly are also what make it so valuable for\nmedicine. Many venom toxins target the same molecules that need to be controlled to treat\n \n1\n\ndiseases. Venom works fast and is highly specific. Its active components—those peptides\nand proteins, working as toxins diabetes have been derived from venom. New treatments\nfor autoimmune diseases, cancer, and pain could be available within a decade.\n \nF “We aren’t talking just a few novel drugs but entire classes of drugs,” says National\nGeographic Society Emerging Explorer Zoltan Takacs, a toxinologist and herpetologist. So\nfar, fewer than a thousand toxins have been scrutinized for medicinal value, and a dozen or\nso major drugs have made it to market. “There could be upwards of 20 million venom\ntoxins out there waiting to be screened,” Takacs says. “It’s huge. Venom has opened up\nwhole new avenues of pharmacology.” Toxins from venom and poison sources are also\ngiving us a clearer picture of how proteins that control many of the body’s crucial cellular\nfunctions work. Studies of the deadly poison tetrodotoxin (TTX) from puffer fish, for\ninstance, have revealed intricate details about the way nerve cells communicate.\nG “We ’re motivated to look for new compounds to lessen human suffering,” Angel\nYanagihara of the University of Hawaii told me. “But while doing that, you may uncover\nthings you don’t expect.” Driven in part out of revenge for a box jellyfish sting she endured\n15 years ago, Yanagihara discovered a potential wound-healing agent within the tubules\nthat contain jellyfish venom. “It had nothing to do with the venom itself,” she said. “By\ngetting intimate with a noxious animal, I’ve been informed way beyond my expectations.”\n \nH More than 100,000 animals have evolved to produce venom, along with the glands to\nhouse it and the apparatuses to expel it: snakes, scorpions, spiders, a few lizards, bees,\nsea creatures such as octopuses, numerous species of fish, and cone snails. The male\nduck-billed platypus, which carries venom inside ankle spurs, is one of the few venomous\nmammals. Venom and its components emerged independently, again and again, in\ndifferent animal groups. The composition of the venom of a single snake species varies\nfrom place to place and between adults and their young. An individual snake’s venom may\neven change with its diet.\nI Although evolution has been fine-tuning these compounds for more than a hundred\nmillion years, venom’s molecular architecture has been in place much longer. Nature\nrepurposes key molecules from around the body—the blood, brain, digestive tract, and\nelsewhere—to serve animals for predation or protection. “It makes sense for nature to steal\nthe scaffolds already in place,” Takacs says. “To make a toxin to wreck the nervous\nsystem, it’s most efficient to take a template from the brain that already works in that\nsystem, make some tiny changes, and there you have it: Now it’s a toxin.” Not all venom\nkills, of course—bees have it as a nonlethal defense, and the male platypus uses it to show\nrival males who’s boss during mating season. But mostly it’s for killing, or at least\nimmobilizing, an animal’s next meal. Humans are often accidental victims. The World\nHealth Organization estimates that every year some five million bites kill 100,000 people,\nalthough the actual number is presumed to be much higher. In rural areas of developing\ncountries, where most bites occur, victims may not be able to get treatment or may instead\nchoose traditional therapies and are therefore not counted.\n \n2",
