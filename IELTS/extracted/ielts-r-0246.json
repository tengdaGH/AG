  "passage_text": "Reading Practice\n \nLanguage diversity\n \nOne of the most influential ideas in the study of languages is that of universal grammar\n(UG). Put forward by Noam Chomsky in the 1960s, it is widely interpreted as meaning that\nall languages are basically the same, and that the human brain is born language-ready,\nwith an in-built programme that is able to interpret the common rules underlying any mother\ntongue. For five decades this idea prevailed, and influenced work in linguistics, psychology\nand cognitive science. To understand language, it implied, you must sweep aside the huge\ndiversity of languages, and find their common human core.\nSince the theory of UG was proposed, linguists have identified many universal language\nrules. However, there are almost always exceptions. It was once believed, for example,\nthat if a language had syllables[1] that begin with a vowel and end with a consonant (VC), it\nwould also have syllables that begin with a consonant and end with a vowel (CV). This\nuniversal lasted until 1999, when linguists showed that Arrernte, spoken by Indigenous\nAustralians from the area around Alice Springs in the Northern Territory, has VC syllables\nbut no CV syllables.\nOther non-universal universals describe the basic rules of putting words together. Take the\nrule that every language contains four basic word classes: nouns, verbs, adjectives and\nadverbs. Work in the past two decades has shown that several languages lack an open\nadverb class, which means that new adverbs cannot be readily formed, unlike in English\nwhere you can turn any adjective into an adverb, for example ‘soft’ into ‘softly’. Others,\nsuch as Lao, spoken in Laos, have no adjectives at all. More controversially, some linguists\nargue that a few languages, such as Straits Salish, spoken by indigenous people from\nnorth-western regions of North America, do not even have distinct nouns or verbs. Instead,\nthey have a single class of words to include events, objects and qualities.\nEven apparently indisputable universals have been found lacking. This includes recursion,\nor the ability to infinitely place one grammatical unit inside a similar unit, such as ‘Jack\nthinks that Mary thinks that ... the bus will be on time’. It is widely considered to be the most\nessential characteristic of human language, one that sets it apart from the communications\nof all other animals. Yet Dan Everett at Illinois State University recently published\ncontroversial work showing that Amazonian Piraha does not have this quality.\nBut what if the very diversity of languages is the key to understanding human\ncommunication? Linguists Nicholas Evans of the Australian National University in\nCanberra, and Stephen Levinson of the Max Planck Institute for Psycholinguistics in\nNijmegen, the Netherlands, believe that languages do not share a common set of rules.\nInstead, they say, their sheer variety is a defining feature of human communication -\nsomething not seen in other animals. While there is no doubt that human thinking\ninfluences the form that language takes, if Evans and Levinson are correct, language in\nturn shapes our brains. This suggests that humans are more diverse than we thought, with\nour brains having differences depending on the language environment in which we grew\nup. And that leads to a disturbing conclusion: every time a language becomes extinct,\nhumanity loses an important piece of diversity.\nIf languages do not obey a single set of shared rules, then how are they created? ‘Instead\nof universals. you get standard engineering solutions that languages adopt again and\nagain, and then you get outliers.' says Evans. He and Levinson argue that this is because\n \n1\n\nany given language is a complex system shaped by many factors, including culture,\ngenetics and history. There- are no absolutely universal traits of language, they say, only\ntendencies. And it is a mix of strong and weak tendencies that characterises the ‘bio-\ncultural’ mix that we call language.\nAccording to the two linguists, the strong tendencies explain why many languages display\ncommon patterns. A variety of factors tend to push language in a similar direction, such as\nthe structure of the brain, the biology of speech, and the efficiencies of communication.\nWidely shared linguistic elements may also be ones that build on a particularly human kind\nof reasoning. For example, the fact that before we learn to speak we perceive the world as\na place full of things causing actions (agents) and things having actions done to them\n(patients) explains why most languages deploy these grammatical categories.\nWeak tendencies, in contrast, are explained by the idiosyncrasies of different languages.\nEvans and Levinson argue that many aspects of the particular natural history of a\npopulation may affect its language. For instance, Andy Butcher at Flinders University in\nAdelaide, South Australia, has observed that indigenous Australian children have by far the\nhighest incidence of chronic middle-ear infection of any population on the planet, and that\nmost indigenous Australian languages lack many sounds that are common in other\nlanguages, but which are hard to hear with a middle-ear infection. Whether this condition\nhas shaped the sound systems of these languages is unknown, says Evans, but it is\nimportant to consider the idea.\nLevinson and Evans are not the first to question the theory of universal grammar, but no\none has summarised these ideas quite as persuasively, and given them as much reach. As\na result, their arguments have generated widespread enthusiasm, particularly among those\nlinguists who are tired of trying to squeeze their findings into the straitjacket of ‘absolute\nuniversals’. To some, it is the final nail in UG’s coffin. Michael Tomasello, co-director of the\nMax Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology in Leipzig, Germany, has been a long-\nstanding critic of the idea that all languages conform to a set of rules. ‘Universal grammar is\ndead,’ he says. \n[1] a unit of sound\n \n2",
