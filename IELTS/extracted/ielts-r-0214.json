  "passage_text": "Reading Practice\n \nHow to Spot a Liar\nHowever much we may abhor it, deception comes naturally to all living things. Birds do it by\nfeigning injury to lead hungry predators away from nesting young. Spider crabs do it by\ndisguise: adorning themselves with strips of kelp and other debris, they pretend to be\nsomething they are not – and so escape their enemies. Nature amply rewards successful\ndeceivers by allowing them to survive long enough to mate and reproduce. So it may come\nas no surprise to learn that human beings- who, according to psychologist Gerald Johnson\nof the University of South California, or lied to about 200 times a day, roughly one untruth\nevery 5 minutes- often deceive for exactly the same reasons: to save their own skins or to\nget something they can’t get by other means.\nBut knowing how to catch deceit  can be just as important a survival skill as knowing how to\ntell a lie and get away with it. A person able to spot falsehood quickly is unlikely to be\nswindled by an unscrupulous business associate or hoodwinked by a devious spouse.\nLuckily, nature provides more than enough clues to trap dissemblers in their own tangled\nwebs- if you know where to look. By closely observing facial expressions, body language\nand tone of voice, practically anyone can recognise the tell-tale signs of lying. Researchers\nare even programming computers – like those used on Lie Detector -to get at the truth by\nanalysing the same physical cues available to the naked eye and ear. “With the proper\ntraining, many people can learn to reliably detect lies,” says Paul Ekman, professor of\npsychology at the University of California, San Francisco, who has spent the past 15 years\nstudying the secret art of deception.\nIn order to know what kind of Lies work best, successful liars need to accurately assess\nother people’s emotional states. Ackman’s research shows that this same emotional\nintelligence is essential for good lie detectors, too. The emotional state to watch out for is\nstress, the conflict most liars feel between the truth and what they actually say and do.\nEven high-tech lie detectors don’t detect lies as such; they merely detect the physical cues\nof emotions, which may or may not correspond to what the person being tested is saying.\nPolygraphs, for instance, measure respiration, heart rate and skin conductivity, which tend\nto increase when people are nervous – as they usually are when lying. Nervous people\ntypically perspire, and the salts contained in perspiration conducts electricity. That’s why\n sudden  leap in skin conductivity indicates nervousness -about getting caught, perhaps -\nwhich makes, in turn, suggest that someone is being economical with the truth. On the\nother hand, it might also mean that the lights in the television Studio are too hot- which is\none reason polygraph tests are inadmissible in court. “Good lie detectors don’t rely on a\nsingle thing”  says Ekma ,but interpret clusters of verbal and non-verbal clues that suggest\nsomeone might be lying.”\nThe clues are written all over the face. Because the musculature of the face is directly\nconnected to the areas of the brain that processes emotion, the countenance  can be a\nwindow to the soul. Neurological studies even suggest that genuine emotions travel\ndifferent pathways through the brain than insincere ones. If a patient paralyzed by stroke\non one side of the face, for example, is asked to  smile deliberately, only the mobile side of\nthe mouth is raised. But tell that same person a funny joke, and the patient breaks into a\nfull and spontaneous smile. Very few people -most notably, actors and politicians- are able\nto consciously control all of their facial expressions. Lies can often be caught when the liars\n \n1\n\ntrue feelings briefly leak through the mask of deception. We don’t think before we feel,\nEkman says. “Expressions tend to show up on the face before we’re even conscious of\nexperiencing an emotion.”\nOne of the most difficult facial expressions to fake- or conceal, if it’s genuinely felt - is\nsadness. When someone is truly sad, the forehead wrinkles with grief and the inner corners\nof the eyebrows are pulled up. Fewer than 15% of the people Ekman tested were able to\nproduce this eyebrow movement voluntarily. By contrast, the lowering of the eyebrows\nassociated with an angry scowl can be replicated at will but almost everybody. “ If someone\nclaims they are sad and the inner corners of their eyebrows don’t go up, Ekmam says, the\nsadness is probably false.”\nThe smile, on the other hand, is one of the easiest facial expressions to counterfeit. It takes\njust two muscles -the zygomaticus major muscles that extend from the cheekbones to the\ncorners of the lips- to produce a grin. But there’s a catch. A genuine smile affects not only\nthe corners of the lips but also the orbicularis oculi, the muscle around the eye that\nproduces the distinctive “crow’s feet” associated with people who laugh a lot. A counterfeit\ngrin can be unmasked if the corners of the lips go up, the eyes crinkle,  but the inner\ncorners of the eyebrows are not lowered, a movement controlled by the orbicularis oculi\nthat is difficult to fake. The absence of lowered eyebrows is one reason why the smile looks\nso strained and stiff.\n \n2",
