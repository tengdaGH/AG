However, in a scientific masterpiece, Svante\nPaabo and his colleagues from the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary\nAnthropology, in Leipzig, have made such a comparison possible. In 2009, at a\nmeeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, they made\npublic an analysis of the genome [1] of Neanderthal man.\n \nB Homo neanderthalensis, to give its proper name, lived in Europe and parts of Asia from\n400,000 years ago to 30,000 years ago. Towards the end of this period it shared its range\nwith interlopers in the form of Homo sapiens [2], who were spreading out from Africa.\nHowever, the two species did not settle down to a stable cohabitation. For reasons which\nare as yet unknown, the arrival of Homo sapiens in a region was always quickly followed by\nthe disappearance of Neanderthals.\n \nC Before 2009, Dr Paabo and his team had conducted only a superficial comparison\nbetween the DNA of Neanderthals and modern humans. Since then, they have\nperformed a more thorough study and, in doing so, have shed a fascinating light on the\nintertwined history of the two species. That history turns out to be more intertwined than\nmany had previously believed.\n \n \nD Dr Paabo and his colleagues compared their Neanderthal genome (painstakingly\nreconstructed from three bone samples collected from a cave in Croatia) with that of\nfive living humans from various parts of Africa and Eurasia. Previous genetic\nanalysis, which had only examined DNA passed from mother to child in cellular\nstructures called mitochondria, had suggested no interbreeding between\nNeanderthals and modern humans. The new, more extensive examination, which\nlooks at DNA in the cell nucleus rather than in the mitochondria, shows this\nconclusion is wrong. By comparing the DNA in the cell nucleus of Africans (whose\nancestors could not have crossbred with Neanderthals, since they did not overlap\nwith them) and various Eurasians (whose ancestors could have crossbred with\nNeanderthals), Dr Paabo has shown that Eurasians are between one percent and\nfour percent Neanderthal.\n \n \n \n \nE That is intriguing. It shows that even after several hundred thousand years of\nseparation, the two species were inter-fertile. It is strange, though, that no\nNeanderthal mitochondrial DNA has turned up in modern humans, since the usual\npattern of invasion in historical times was for the invaders’ males to mate with the\ninvaded’s females. One piece of self-knowledge, then - at least for non-Africans - is\nthat they have a dash of Neanderthal in them. But Dr Paabo’s work also illuminates\nthe differences between the species. By comparing modem humans, Neanderthals,\nand chimpanzees, it is possible to distinguish genetic changes which are shared by\nseveral species of human in their evolution away from the great-ape lineage, from\nthose which are unique to Homo sapiens.\nF More than 90 percent of the ‘human accelerated regions’ [3] that have been identified\nin modem people are found in Neanderthals too. However, the rest are not. Dr Paabo has\nidentified 212 parts of the genome that seem to have undergone significant evolution since\n \n1\n\n \nthe species split. The state of genome science is still quite primitive, and it is often unclear\nwhat any given bit of DNA is actually doing. But an examination of the 20 largest regions of\nDNA that have evolved in this way shows that they include several genes which are\nassociated with cognitive ability, and whose malfunction causes serious mental problems.\nThese genes therefore look like good places to start the search for modern humanity’s\nessence.\nG The newly evolved regions of DNA also include a gene called RUNX2, which\ncontrols bone growth. That may account for differences in the shape of the skull and\nthe rib cage between the two species. By contrast an earlier phase of the study had\nalready shown that Neanderthals and moderns share the same version of a gene\ncalled FOXP2, which is involved in the ability to speak, and which differs in\nchimpanzees. It is all, then, very promising - and a second coup in quick succession\nfor Dr Paabo. Another of his teams has revealed the existence of a hitherto\nunsuspected species of human, using mitochondrial DNA found in a little-finger\nbone. If that species, too, could have its full genome read, humanity’s ability to know\nitself would be enhanced even further.\n[1] an individual’s complete set of genes\n \n[2] the scientific name for modem humans\n[3] parts of the human brain which evolved very rapidly\n \n2",
