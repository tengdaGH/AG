  "passage_text": "Reading Practice\n \nNumeration\nOne of the first great intellectual feats of a young child is learning how to talk, closely\nfollowed by learning how to count. From earliest childhood we are so bound up with our\nsystem of numeration that it is a feat of imagination to consider the problems faced by\nearly humans who had not yet developed this facility. Careful consideration of our system\nof numeration leads to the conviction that, rather than being a facility that comes naturally\nto a person, it | is one of the great and remarkable achievements of the human race.\nIt is impossible to learn the sequence of events that led to our developing the concept of\nnumber. Even the earliest of tribes had a system of numeration that, if not advanced,\nwas sufficient for the tasks that they had to perform. Our ancestors had little use for actual\nnumbers; instead their considerations would have been more of the kind Is this enough?\nrather than How many? when they were engaged in food gathering, for example. However,\nwhen early humans first began to reflect on the nature of things around them, they\ndiscovered that they needed an idea of number simply to keep their thoughts in order. As\nthey began to settle, grow plants and herd animals, the need for a sophisticated number\nsystem became paramount. It will never be known how and when this numeration ability\ndeveloped, but it is certain that numeration was well developed by the time humans had\nformed even semipermanent settlements.\nEvidence of early stages of arithmetic and numeration can be readily found. The\nindigenous peoples of Tasmania were only able to count one, two, many; those of South\nAfrica counted one, two, two and one, two twos, two twos and one, and so on. But in real\nsituations the number and words are often accompanied by gestures to help resolve any\nconfusion. For example, when using the one, two, many type of system, the word many\nwould mean, Look at my hands and see how many fingers I am showing you. This basic\napproach is limited in the range of numbers that it can express, but this range will generally\nsuffice when dealing with the simpler aspects of human existence.\nThe lack of ability of some cultures to deal with large numbers is not really surprising.\nEuropean languages, when traced back to their earlier version, are very poor in number\nwords and expressions. The ancient Gothic word for ten, tachund, is used to express\nthe number 100 as tachund tachund. By the seventh century, the word teon had\nbecome interchangeable with the tachund or hund of the Anglo-Saxon language, and so\n100 was denoted as hund leonlig, or ten times ten. The average person in the seventh\ncentury in Europe was not as familiar with numbers as we are today. In fact, to qualify as a\nwitness in a court of law a man had to be able to count to nine!\nPerhaps the most fundamental step in developing a sense of number is not the ability to\ncount, but rather to see that a number is really an abstract idea instead of a simple\nattachment to a group of particular objects. It must have been within the grasp of the\nearliest humans to conceive that four birds are distinct from two birds; however, it is not an\nelementary step to associate the number 4, as connected with four birds, to the number 4,\nas connected with four rocks. Associating a number as one of the qualities of a specific\nobject is a great hindrance to the development of a true number sense. When the number 4\ncan be registered in the mind as a specific word, independent of the object being\nreferenced, the individual is ready to take the first step toward the development of a\n \n1\n\nnotational system for numbers and, from there, to arithmetic.\nTraces of the very first stages in the development of numeration can be seen in several\nliving languages today. The numeration system of the Tsimshian language in British\nColumbia contains seven distinct sets of words for numbers according to the class of the\nitem being counted: for counting flat objects and animals, for round objects and time, for\npeople, for long objects and trees, for canoes, for measures, and for counting when no\nparticular object is being numerated. It seems that the last is a later development while the\nfirst six groups show the relics of an older system. This diversity of number names can also\nbe found in some widely used languages such as Japanese.\nIntermixed with the development of a number sense is the development of an ability to\ncount. Counting is not directly related to the formation of a number concept because it is\npossible to count by matching the items being counted against a group of pebbles, grains\nof corn, or the counter's fingers. These aids would have been indispensable to very early\npeople who would have found the process impossible without some form of mechanical\naid. Such aids, while different, are still used even by the most educated in today's society\ndue to their convenience.\nAll counting ultimately involves reference to something other than the things being counted.\nAt first it may have been grains or pebbles but now it is a memorised sequence of words\nthat happen to be the names of the numbers.\n \n2",
