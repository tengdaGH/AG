  "passage_text": "Reading Practice\nThe story of silk\nThe history of the world’s most luxurious fabric, from ancient China to the present\nday\nSilk is a fine, smooth material produced from the cocoons - soft protective shells - that are\nmade by mulberry silkworms (insect larvae). Legend has it that it was Lei Tzu, wife of the\nYellow Emperor, ruler of China in about 3000 BC, who discovered silkworms. One account\nof the story goes that as she was taking a walk in her husband’s gardens, she\ndiscovered that silkworms were responsible for the destruction of several mulberry trees.\nShe collected a number of cocoons and sat down to have a rest. It just so happened that\nwhile she was sipping some tea, one of the cocoons that she had collected landed in the\nhot tea and started to unravel into a fine thread. Lei Tzu found that she could wind this\nthread around her fingers. Subsequently, she persuaded her husband to allow her to rear\nsilkworms on a grove of mulberry trees. She also devised a special reel to draw the\nfibres from the cocoon into a single thread so that they would be strong enough to\nbe woven into fabric. While it is unknown just how much of this is true, it is certainly known\nthat silk cultivation has existed in China for several millennia.\nOriginally, silkworm farming was solely restricted to women, and it was they who were\nresponsible for the growing, harvesting and weaving. Silk quickly grew into a symbol of\nstatus, and originally, only royalty were entitled to have clothes made of silk. The rules\nwere gradually relaxed over the years until finally during the Qing Dynasty (1644—1911\nAD), even peasants, the lowest caste, were also entitled to wear silk. Sometime during\nthe Han Dynasty (206 BC-220 AD), silk was so prized that it was also used as a unit\nof currency. Government officials were paid their salary in silk, and farmers paid their taxes\nin grain and silk. Silk was also used as diplomatic gifts by the emperor. Fishing lines,\nbowstrings, musical instruments and paper were all made using silk. The earliest indication\nof silk paper being used was discovered in the tomb of a noble who is estimated to have\ndied around 168 AD.\nDemand for this exotic fabric eventually created the lucrative trade route now known as the\nSilk Road, taking silk westward and bringing gold, silver and wool to the East. It was named\nthe Silk Road after its most precious commodity, which was considered to be worth\nmore than gold. The Silk Road stretched over 6,000 kilometres from Eastern China to the\nMediterranean Sea, following the Great Wall of China, climbing the Pamir mountain range,\ncrossing modern-day Afghanistan and going on to the Middle East, with a major trading\nmarket in Damascus. From there, the merchandise was shipped across the\nMediterranean Sea. Few merchants travelled the entire route; goods were handled mostly\nby a series of middlemen.\nWith the mulberry silkworm being native to China, the country was the world’s\nsole producer of silk for many hundreds of years. The secret of silk-making\neventually reached the rest of the world via the Byzantine Empire, which ruled over\nthe Mediterranean region of southern Europe, North Africa and the Middle East during the\nperiod 330—1453 AD. According to another legend, monks working for the Byzantine\nemperor Justinian smuggle silkworm eggs to Constantinople (Istanbul in modern-day\nTurkey) in 550 AD, concealed inside hollow bamboo walking canes. The Byzantines were\nas secretive as the Chinese, however, and for many centuries the weaving and trading of\n \n1\n\nsilk fabric was a strict imperial monopoly. Then in the seventh century, the Arabs\nconquered Persia, capturing their magnificent silks in the process.\nSilk production thus spread through Africa, Sicily and Spain as the Arabs swept, through\nthese lands. Andalusia in southern Spain was Europe’s main silk-producing centre in the\ntenth century. By the thirteenth century, however, Italy had become Europe’s leader in silk\nproduction and export. Venetian merchants traded extensively in silk and encouraged\nsilk growers to settle in Italy. Even now, silk processed in the province of Como in northern\nItaly enjoys an esteemed reputation.\nThe nineteenth century and industrialisation saw the downfall of the European silk industry.\nCheaper Japanese silk, trade in which was greatly facilitated by the opening of the Suez\nCanal, was one of the many factors driving the trend. Then in the twentieth century, new\nmanmade fibres, such as nylon, started to be used in what had traditionally been silk\nproducts, such as stockings and parachutes. The two world wars, which interrupted the\nsupply of raw material from Japan, also stifled the European silk industry. After the\nSecond World War, Japan’s silk production was restored, with improved production\nand quality of raw silk. Japan was to remain the world’s biggest producer of raw silk, and\npractically the only major exporter of raw silk, until the 1970s. However, in more recent\ndecades, China has gradually recaptured its position as the world’s biggest producer and\nexporter of raw silk and silk yarn. Today, around 125,000 metric tons of silk are produced in\nthe world, and almost two thirds of that production takes place in China.\n \n2",
