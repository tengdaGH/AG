  "passage_text": "Reading Practice\n \n \nCosmetics in Ancient Past\nA\n \nSince cosmetics and perfumes are still in wide use today, it is interesting to compare the\nattitudes, customs and beliefs related to them in ancient times to those of our own day and\nage. Cosmetics and perfumes have been popular since the dawn of civilization; it is shown\nby the discovery of a great deal of pertinent archaeological material, dating from the third\nmillennium BC. Mosaics, glass perfume flasks, stone vessels, ovens, cooking-pots, clay\njars, etc., some inscribed by the hand of the artisan. Evidence also appears in the Bible\nand other classical writings, where it is written that spices and perfumes were prestigious\nproducts known throughout the ancient world and coveted by kings and princes. The\nwritten and pictorial descriptions, as well as archaeological findings, all show how important\nbody care and aesthetic appearance were in the lives of the ancient people. The chain of\nevidence spans many centuries, detailing the usage of cosmetics in various cultures from\nthe earliest period of recorded history.\nB\nIn antiquity, however, at least in the onset, cosmetics served in religious ceremonies and\nfor healing purposes. Cosmetics were also connected with cultic worship and witchcraft: to\nappease the various gods, fragrant ointments were applied to the statuary images and\neven to their attendants. From this, in the course of time, developed the custom of personal\nuse, to enhance the beauty of the face and the body, and to conceal defects. \nC\n \nPerfumes and fragrant spices were precious commodities in antiquity, very much in\ndemand, and at times even exceeded silver and gold in value. Therefore they were luxury\nproducts, used mainly in the temples and in the homes of the noble and wealthy. The\nJudean kings kept them in treasure houses (2 Kings 20:13). And the Queen of Sheba\nbrought to Solomon “camels laden with spices, gold in great quantity and precious stones.”\n(1 Kings 10:2, 10). However, within time, the use of cosmetics became the custom of that\nperiod. The use of cosmetics became widespread among the lower classes as well as\namong the wealthy; in the same way, they washed the body, so they used to care for the\nbody with substances that softened the skin and anoint it with fragrant oils and ointments.\nD\nFacial treatment was highly developed and women devoted many hours to it. They used to\nspread various scented creams on the face and to apply makeup in vivid and contrasting\ncolors. An Egyptian papyrus from the 16th century BC contains detailed recipes to remove\nblemishes, wrinkles, and other signs of age. Greek and Roman women would cover their\nfaces in the evening with a “beauty mask” to remove blemishes, which consisted mainly of\nflour mixed with fragrant spices, leaving it on their face all night. The next morning they\nwould wash it off with asses’ milk. The very common creams used by women in the ancient\nFar East, particularly important in the hot climate and prevalent in that area of the globe,\n \n1\n\n \n \nwere made up of oils and aromatic scents. Sometimes the oil in these creams was\nextracted from olives, almonds, gourds, sesame, or from trees and plants; but, for those of\nlimited means, scented animal and fish fats were commonly used.\nE\n \nWomen in the ancient past commonly put colors around their eyes. Besides beautification,\nits purpose was also medicinal as covering the sensitive skin of the lids with colored\nointments that prevented dryness and eye diseases: the eye-paint repelled the little flies\nthat transmitted eye inflammations. Egyptian women colored the upper eyelid black and the\nlower one green and painted the space between the upper lid and the eyebrow gray and\nblue. The women of Mesopotamia favored yellows and reds. The use of kohl for painting\nthe eyes is mentioned three times in the Bible, always with disapproval by the sages (2\nKings, 9:30; Jeremiah 4:30; Ezekiel 23:40). In contrast, Job named one of his daughters\n“Keren Happukh”- “horn of eye paint” (Job 42:14)\nF\n \n \nGreat importance was attached to the care for hair in ancient times. Long hair was always\nconsidered a symbol of beauty, and kings, nobles and dignitaries grew their hair long and\nkept it well-groomed and cared for. Women devoted much time to the style of the hair;\nwhile no cutting, they would apply much care to it by arranging it skillfully in plaits and\n“building it up” sometimes with the help of wigs. Egyptian women generally wore their hair\nflowing down to their shoulders or even longer. In Mesopotamia, women cherished long\nhair as a part of their beauty, and hair flowing down their backs in a thick plait and tied with\na ribbon is seen in art. Assyrian women wore their hair shorter, braiding and binding it in a\nbun at the back. In Ancient Israel, brides would wear their hair long on the wedding day as\na sign of their virginity. Ordinary people and slaves, however, usually wore their hair short,\nmainly for hygienic reasons, since they could not afford to invest in the kind of treatment\nthat long hair required.\nG\nFrom the Bible and Egyptian and Assyrian sources, as well as the words of classical\nauthors, it appears that the centers of the trade-in aromatic resins and incense were\nlocated in the kingdoms of southern Arabia, and even as far as India, where some of these\nprecious aromatic plants were grown. “Dealers from Sheba and Rammah dealt with you,\noffering the choicest spices…” (Ezekiel 27:22). The Nabateans functioned as the important\nmiddlemen in this trade; Palestine also served as a very important component, as the trade\nroutes crisscrossed the country. It is known that the Egyptian Queen Hatsheput (15th\ncentury BC) sent a royal expedition to the Land of Punt (Somalia) in order to bring back\nmyrrh seedlings to plant in her temple. In Assyrian records of tribute and spoils of war,\nperfumes and resins are mentioned; the text from the time of Tukulti-Ninurta II (890-884\nBC) refers to balls of myrrh as a part of the tribute brought to the Assyrian king by the\nAramaean kings. The trade-in spices and perfumes are also mentioned in the Bible as\nwritten in Genesis (37:25-26), “Camels carrying gum tragacanth and balm and myrrh”.\n \n2",
