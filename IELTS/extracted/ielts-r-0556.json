  "passage_text": "Reading Practice\n \n   \nThe Sound of Dolphin\n \nA.\nEach and every dolphin has a different sound just like you and me, a sound that other\ndolphins recognize as a particular individual. Even a new baby dolphin, (calf), can detect its\nmother’s whistle within the pod soon after birth. Utilizing their blowholes, air sacks and\nvalves, dolphins can emit a very wide variety of sounds. In fact, the frequency levels range\n10 times beyond what humans can hear.\n \n  \nB.  This system is called “Echolocation”, or “Sonar”, just like what a submarine uses to\nnavigate while underwater. Yet the dolphins sonar is much more advanced than human\ntechnology and can pin point exact information about its surroundings ranging from size,\ndistance and even the nature of the object.\n \n  \nC. Millions of years ago, toothed whales developed echolocation, a sensory faculty that\nenabled them to survive in often murky and dark aquatic environments. It is a process in\nwhich an organism probes its environment by emitting sounds and listening to echoes as\nthe sounds bounce off objects in the environment. With sound traveling better in water than\nelectromagnetic, thermal, chemical, or light signals, it was advantageous for dolphins to\nevolve echolocation, a capability in which acoustic energy is used, in a sense, to see\nunderwater. Synonymous with the term “sonar” (sound navigation and ranging) and used\ninterchangeably, dolphin echolocation is considered to be the most advanced sonar\ncapability, unrivaled by any sonar system on Earth, man-made or natural.\n \nD. Dolphins identify themselves with a signature whistles. However, scientists have found\nno evidence of a dolphin language. For example, a mother dolphin may whistle to her calf\nalmost continually for several days after giving birth. This acoustic imprinting helps the calf\nlearn to identify its mother. Besides whistles, dolphins produce clicks and sounds that\nresemble moans, trills, grunts and squeaks. They make these sounds at any time and at\nconsiderable depths. Sounds vary in volume, wavelength, frequency and pattern. Dolphins\nproduce sounds ranging from 0.25 to 150 kHz. The lower frequency vocalizations (0.25 to\n50 kHz) are likely used in social communication. Higher frequency clicks (40 to 150 kHz)\nare primarily used in echolocation. Dolphins rely heavily on sound production and reception\nto navigate, communicate, and hunt in dark or murky waters. Under these conditions, sight\nis of little use. Dolphins can produce clicks and whistles at the same time.\nE.  As with all toothed whales, a dolphin’s larynx does not possess vocal cords, but\nresearchers have theorized that at least some sound production originates from the larynx.\nEarly studies suggested that “whistles” were generated in the larynx while “clicks” were\nproduced in the nasal sac region. Technological advances in bio-acoustic research enable\nscientists to better explore the nasal region. Studies suggest that a tissue complex in the\nnasal region is most likely the site of all sound production. Movements of air in the trachea\nand nasal sacs probably produce sounds.\n \n1\n\n \n \n \nF.  The process of echolocation begins when dolphins emit very short sonar pulses called\nclicks, which are typically less than 50-70 millionth of a second long. The clicks are emitted\nfrom the melon of the dolphin in a narrow beam. A special fat in the melon called lipid helps\nto focus the clicks into a beam. The echoes that are reflected off the object are then\nreceived by the lower jaws. They enter through certain parts of the lower jaw and are\ndirected to ear bones by lipid fat channels. The characteristics of the echoes are then\ntransmitted directly to the brain.\n \nG.  The short echolocation clicks used by dolphins can encode a considerable amount of\ninformation on an ensonified object - much more information than is possible from signals\nof longer duration that are emitted by manned sonar. Underwater sounds can penetrate\nobjects, producing echoes from the portion of the object as well as from other surfaces\nwithin the object. This provides dolphins with a way to gain more information than if only a\nsimple reflection occurred at the front of the object.\n \nH.  Dolphins are extremely mobile creatures and can therefore direct their sonar signals on\nan object from many different orientations, with slightly different bits of information being\nreturned at each orientation; and since the echolocation clicks are so brief and numerous,\nthe multiple reflections from internal surfaces return to the animal as distinct entities and\nare used by the dolphin to distinguish between different types of objects. Since they\npossess extremely good auditory-spatial memory, it seems that they are able to\n“remember” all the important information received from the echoes taken from different\npositions and orientations as they navigate and scan their environment. Dolphins’\nextremely high mobility and good auditory spatial memory are capabilities that enhance\ntheir use of echolocation. With much of the dolphin’s large brain (which is slightly larger\nthan the human brain) devoted to acoustic signal processing, we can better understand the\nevolutionary importance of this extraordinary sensory faculty. Yet no one feature in the\nprocess of echolocation is more important than the other. Dolphin sonar must be\nconsidered as a complete system, well adapted to the dolphin’s overall objective of finding\nprey, avoiding predators, and avoiding dangerous environments.\nI.   This ideal evolutionary adaption has contributed to the success of cetacean hunting and\nfeeding and their survival as a species overall. As a result, dolphins are especially good at\nfinding and identifying prey in shallow and noisy coastal waters containing rocks and other\nobjects. By using their sonar ability, dolphins are able to detect and recognize prey that\nhave burrowed up to 1 feet into sandy ocean or river bottoms –a talent that has stirred the\nimagination (and envy) of designers of manmade sonar. \nJ.  Researchers, documenting the behavior of Atlantic dolphins foraging for buried prey\nalong the banks of Grand Bahama Island, have found that these dolphins, while swimming\nclose to the bottom searching for prey, typically move their heads in a scanning motion,\neither swinging their snout back and forth or moving their heads in a circular motion as they\nemit sonar sounds. They have been observed digging as deep as 18 inches into the sand\n \n2\n\nto secure a prey. Such a capability is unparalleled in the annals of human sonar \ndevelopment. \n \n3",
