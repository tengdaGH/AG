  "passage_text": "Reading Practice\n \nTea and the Industrial Revolution\nA Cambridge professor says that a change in drinking babits was the reason for the\n \n \nIndustrial Revolution in Britain. Anjana Abuja reports\n \nA     Alan Macfarlane, professor of anthropological science at King’s College, Cambridge\nhas, like other historians, spent decades wrestling with the enigma of the Industrial\nRevolution. Why did this particular Big Bang – the world-changing birth of industry-happen\nin Britain? And why did it strike at the end of the 18th century?\n \nB      Macfarlane compares the puzzle to a combination lock. ‘There are about 20 different\nfactors and all of them need to be present before the revolution can happen,’ he says. For\nindustry to take off, there needs to be the technology and power to drive factories, large\nurban populations to provide cheap labour, easy transport to move goods around, an\naffluent middle-class willing to buy mass-produced objects, a market-driven economy and a\npolitical system that allows this to happen. While this was the case for England, other\nnations, such as Japan, the Netherlands and France also met some of these criteria but\nwere not industrialising. All these factors must have been necessary. But not sufficient to\ncause the revolution, says Macfarlane. ‘After all, Holland had everything except coal while\nChina also had many of these factors. Most historians are convinced there are one or two\nmissing factors that you need to open the lock.’\n \nC      The missing factors, he proposes, are to be found in almost even kitchen cupboard.\nTea and beer, two of the nation’s favourite drinks, fuelled the revolution. The antiseptic\nproperties of tannin, the active ingredient in tea, and of hops in beer – plus the fact that\nboth are made with boiled water – allowed urban communities to flourish at close quarters\nwithout succumbing to water-borne diseases such as dysentery. The theory sounds\neccentric but once he starts to explain the detective work that went into his deduction, the\nscepticism gives way to wary admiration. Macfarlanes case has been strengthened by\nsupport from notable quarters – Roy Porter, the distinguished medical historian, recently\nwrote a favourable appraisal of his research.\n \nD      Macfarlane had wondered for a long time how the Industrial Revolution came about.\nHistorians had alighted on one interesting factor around the mid-18th century that required\nexplanation. Between about 1650 and 1740the population in Britain was static. But then\nthere was a burst in population growth. Macfarlane says: ‘The infant mortality rate halved in\nthe space of 20 years, and this happened in both rural areas and cities, and across all\nclasses. People suggested four possible causes. Was there a sudden change in the\nviruses and bacteria around? Unlikely. Was there a revolution in medical science? But this\nwas a century before Lister’s revolution*. Was there a change in environmental conditions?\nThere were improvements in agriculture that wiped out malaria, but these were small gains.\nSanitation did not become widespread until the 19th century. The only option left is food.\nBut the height and weight statistics show a decline. So the food must have got worse.\nEfforts to explain this sudden reduction in child deaths appeared to draw a blank.’\nE     This population burst seemed to happen at just the right time to provide labour for the\nIndustrial Revolution. ‘When you start moving towards an industrial revolution, it is\neconomically efficient to have people living close together,’  says Macfarlane. ‘But then you\nget disease, particularly from human waste.’ Some digging around in historical records\nrevealed that there was a change in the incidence of water-borne disease at that time,\n \n1\n\nespecially dysentery. Macfarlane deduced that whatever the British were drinking must\nhave been important in regulating disease. He says, ‘We drank beer. For a long time, the\nEnglish were protected by the strong antibacterial agent in hops, which were added to help\npreserve the beer. But in the late 17th century a tax was introduced on malt, the basic\ningredient of beer. The poor turned to water and gin and in the 1720s the mortality rate\nbegan to rise again. Then it suddenly dropped again. What caused this?’\n \nF      Macfarlane looked to Japan, which was also developing large cities about the same\ntime, and also had no sanitation. Water-borne diseases had a much looser grip on the\nJapanese population than those in Britain. Could it be the prevalence of tea in their culture?\nMacfarlane then noted that the history of tea in Britain provided an extraordinary\ncoincidence of dates. Tea was relatively expensive until Britain started a direct dipper trade\nwith China in the early 18th century. By the 1740s, about the time that infant mortality was\ndipping, the drink was common. Macfarlane guessed that the fact that water had to be\nboiled, together with the stomach-purifying properties of tea meant that the breast milk\nprovided by mothers was healthier than it had ever been. No other European nation sipped\ntea like the British, which, by Macfarlanes logic, pushed these other countries out of\ncontention for the revolution.\nG     But, if tea is a factor in the combination lock, why didn’t Japan forge ahead in a tea-\nsoaked industrial revolution of its own? Macfarlane notes that even though 17th-century\nJapan had large cities, high literacy rates, even a futures market, it had turned its back on\nthe essence of any work-based revolution by giving up labour-saving devices such as\nanimals, afraid that they would put people out of work. So, the nation that we now think of\nas one of the most technologically advanced entered the 19th century having ‘abandoned\nthe wheel’.\n \n2",
