  "passage_text": "Reading Practice\n \nVideo game research\nAlthough video games were first developed for adults, they are no longer exclusively\nreserved for the grown ups in the home. In 2006, Rideout and Hamel reported that as many\nas 29 percent of preschool children (children between two and six years old) in the United\nStates had played console video games, and 18 percent had played hand-held ones. Given\nyoung children’s insatiable eagerness to learn, coupled with the fact that they are clearly\nsurrounded by these media, we predict that preschoolers will both continue and\nincreasingly begin to adopt video games for personal enjoyment. Although the majority of\ngaming equipment is still designed for a much older target audience, once a game system\nenters the household it is potentially available for all family members, including the\nyoungest. Portable systems have done a particularly good job of penetrating the younger\nmarket.\nResearch in the video game market is typically done at two stages: some time close to the\nend of the product cycle, in order to get feedback from consumers, so that a marketing\nstrategy can be developed; and at the very end of the product cycle to ‘fix bugs’ in the\ngame. While both of those types of research are important, and may be appropriate for\ndealing with adult consumers, neither of them aids in designing better games, especially\nwhen it comes to designing for an audience that may have particular needs, such as\npreschoolers or senior citizens. Instead, exploratory and formative research has to be\nundertaken in order to truly understand those audiences, their abilities, their perspective,\nand their needs. In the spring of 2007, our preschool-game production team at Nickelodeon\nhad a hunch that the Nintendo DS - with its new features, such as the microphone, small\nsize and portability, and its relatively low price point - was a ripe gaming platform for\npreschoolers. There were a few games on the market at the time which had characters that\nappealed to the younger set, but our game producers did not think that the game\nmechanics or design were appropriate for preschoolers. What exactly preschoolers could\ndo with the system, however, was a bit of a mystery. So we set about doing a study to\nanswer the query: What could we expect preschoolers to be capable of in the context of\nhand-held game play, and how might the child development literature inform us as we\nproceeded with the creation of a new outlet for this age group?\nOur context in this case was the United States, although the games that resulted were also\nreleased in other regions, due to the broad international reach of the characters. In order to\ndesign the best possible DS product for a preschool audience we were fully committed to\nthe ideals of a ‘user-centered approach’, which assumes that users will be at least\nconsidered, but ideally consulted during the development process. After all, when it comes\nto introducing a new interactive product to the child market, and particularly such a young\nage group within it, we believe it is crucial to assess the range of physical and cognitive\nabilities associated with their specific developmental stage.\nRevelle and Medoff (2002) review some of the basic reasons why home entertainment\nsystems, computers, and other electronic gaming devices, are often difficult for\npreschoolers to use. In addition to their still developing motor skills (which make\nmanipulating a controller with small buttons difficult), many of the major stumbling blocks\nare cognitive. Though preschoolers are learning to think symbolically, and understand that\npictures can stand for real-life objects, the vast majority are still unable to read and write.\nThus, using text-based menu selections is not viable. Mapping is yet another obstacle\n \n1\n\nsince preschoolers may be unable to understand that there is a direct link between how the\ncontroller is used and the activities that appear before them on screen. Though this aspect\nis changing, in traditional mapping systems real life movements do not usually translate\ninto game-based activity.\nOver the course of our study, we gained many insights into how preschoolers interact with\nvarious platforms, including the DS. For instance, all instructions for preschoolers need to\nbe in voice-over, and include visual representations, and this has been one of the most\ndifficult areas for us to negotiate with respect to game design on the DS. Because the\ngame cartridges have very limited memory capacity, particularly in comparison to console\nor computer games, the ability to capture large amounts of voice-over data via sound files\nor visual representations of instructions becomes limited. Text instructions take up minimal\nmemory, so they are preferable from a technological perspective. Figuring out ways to\nmaximise sound and graphics files, while retaining the clear visual and verbal cues that we\nknow are critical for our youngest players, is a constant give and take. Another of our\nfindings indicated that preschoolers may use either a stylus, or their fingers, or both\nalthough they are not very accurate with either. One of the very interesting aspects of the\nDS is that the interface, which is designed to respond to stylus interactions, can also\neffectively be used with the tip of the finger. This is particularly noteworthy in the context of\npreschoolers for two reasons. Firstly, as they have trouble with fine motor skills and their\nhand-eye coordination is still in development, they are less exact with their stylus\nmovements; and secondly, their fingers are so small that they mimic the stylus very\neffectively, and therefore by using their fingers they can often be more accurate in their\ngame interactions. \n \n2",
