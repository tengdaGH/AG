  "passage_text": "Reading Practice\n \nThe meaning of volunteering\nA\nVolunteering, as some people consider mistakenly is a plethora of people from all walk of\nlife as well as activities, but data from the other side of the world suggest otherwise. For\nexample, a survey on who participated in volunteering by the Office for National Statistics\n(ONS) in the United Kingdom (UK) showed that people in higher income households are\nmore likely than others to volunteer. In England and Wales, 57% of adults with gross\nannual household incomes of £75.000 or more, have volunteered formally In the 12 months\nprior to the survey date. They were almost twice more likely to have done so than those\nliving in households with as annual income under £10.000.\nB\nAs well as having high household incomes, volunteers also tend to have higher academic\nqualifications, be in higher socio-economic groups and be in employment. Among people\nwith a degree or postgraduate qualification, 79 per cent had volunteered informally and 57\nper cent had volunteered formally in the previous 12 months. For people with no\nqualifications the corresponding proportions were 52 per cent and 23 per cent at all.\nHowever, voluntary work is certainly not the exclusive preserve of the rich. Does the\nanswer not lie perhaps in the fact that the rich tend to have money to allow them the time to\nbe become involved in voluntary work compared to less well-off people?\nC\nA breakdown in the year 2000 of the range of volunteering activities taken from The\nAustralia Bureau of Statistics gives an idea of the scale of activities in which people are\ntypically involved. Eleven sectors are given ranging from Community and Welfare, which\naccounted for just over a quarter of the total hours volunteered in Australia, to Law/ justice/\npolitics with 1.2 percent at the other and of the scale. Other fields included sport/\nrecreation, religious activities and education, following at 21/1 per cent, 16.9 and 14.3 per\ncent of the total hours. The data here also seem to point to a cohort of volunteers with\nexpertise and experience.\nD\nThe knock-on effect of volunteering on the lives of individuals can be profound. Voluntary\nwork helps foster independence and imparts the ability to deal with different situations,\noften simultaneously, thus teaching people how to work their way through different\nsystems. It therefore brings people into touch with the real world; and, hence, equips them\nfor the future.\nE\nInitially, young adults in their late teens might not seem to have the expertise or knowledge\nto impart to others that say a teacher or agriculturalist or nurse would have, but they do\nhave many skills that can help others. And in the absence of any particular talent, their\nenergy and enthusiasm can be harnessed for the benefit of their fellow human beings, and\nultimately themselves. From all this, the gain to any community no matter how many\nvolunteers are involved is immeasurable.\n \n1\n\nF\nEmployers will generally look favorably on people who have shown an ability to work as\npart of a team. It demonstrates a willingness to learn and an independent spirit, which\nwould be desirable qualities in any employee. So to satisfy employers’ demands for\nexperience when applying for work, volunteering can act as a means of gaining experience\nthat might otherwise elude would-be workers and can ultimately lead to paid employment\nand the desired field.\nG\nBut what are the prerequisites for becoming a volunteer? One might immediately think of\nattributes like kindness, selflessness, strength of character, ability to deal with others,\ndetermination, adaptability and flexibility and a capacity to comprehend the ways of other\npeople. While offering oneself selflessly, working as a volunteer makes further demands on\nthe individual. It requires a strength of will, a sense of moral responsibility for one’s fellow\nhuman beings, and an ability to fit into the ethos of an organization. But it also requires\nsomething which in no way detracts from valuable work done by volunteers and which may\nseem at first glance both contradictory and surprising: self interest.\nH\nOrganizations involved in any voluntary work have to be realistic about this. If someone,\nwhatever the age is going to volunteer and devote their time without money, they do need\nto receive something from it for themselves. People who are unemployed can use\nvolunteer work as a stepping-stone to employment or as a means of finding out whether\nthey really like the field the plan to enter or as a way to help them find themselves.\nI\nIt is tempting to use some form of community work as an alternative to national service or\nas punishment for petty criminals by making the latter for example clean up parks, wash\naway graffiti, work with victims of their own or other people. Thus may be acceptable, but it\ndoes not constitute volunteer work, two cardinal rules of which are the willingness to\nvolunteer without coercion and working unpaid.    .\n \n2",
