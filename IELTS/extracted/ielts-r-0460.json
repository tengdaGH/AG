  "passage_text": "Reading Practice\n \nThe Dinosaurs Footprints and Extinction\nA\nEVERYBODY knows that the dinosaurs were killed by an asteroid. Something big hit the\nearth 65 million years ago and, when the dust had fallen, so had the great reptiles. There is\nthus a nice if ironic, symmetry in the idea that a similar impact brought about the dinosaurs’\nrise. That is the thesis proposed by Paul Olsen, of Columbia University, and his colleagues\nin this week’s Science.\nB\nDinosaurs first appeared in the fossil record 230m years ago, during the Triassic period.\nBut they were mostly small, and they shared the earth with lots of other sorts of reptile. It\nwas in the subsequent Jurassic, which began 202 million years ago, that they overran the\nplanet and turned into the monsters depicted in the book and movie “Jurassic Park”.\n(Actually, though, the dinosaurs that appeared on screen were from the still more recent\nCretaceous period.) Dr Olsen and his colleagues are not the first to suggest that the\ndinosaurs inherited the earth as the result of an asteroid strike. But they are the first to\nshow that the takeover did, indeed, happen in a geological eyeblink.\nC\nDinosaur skeletons are rare. Dinosaur footprints are, however, surprisingly abundant. And\nthe sizes of the prints are as good an indication of the sizes of the beasts as are the\nskeletons themselves. Dr Olsen and his colleagues, therefore, concentrated on prints, not\nbones.\nD\nThe prints in question were made in eastern North America, a part of the world the full of rift\nvalleys to those in East Africa today. Like the modern African rift valleys, the\nTriassic/Jurassic American ones contained lakes, and these lakes grew and shrank at\nregular intervals because of climatic changes caused by periodic shifts in the earth’s orbit.\n(A similar phenomenon is responsible for modern ice ages.) That regularity, combined with\nreversals in the earth’s magnetic field, which are detectable in the tiny fields of certain\nmagnetic minerals, means that rocks from this place and period can be dated to within a\nfew thousand years. As a bonus, squishy lake-edge sediments are just the things for\nrecording the tracks of passing animals. By dividing the labour between themselves, the\nten authors of the paper were able to study such tracks at 80 sites.\nE\nThe researchers looked at 18 so-called ichnotaxa. These are recognizable types of the\nfootprint that cannot be matched precisely with the species of animal that left them. But\nthey can be matched with a general sort of animal, and thus act as an indicator of the fate\nof that group, even when there are no bones to tell the story. Five of the ichnotaxa\ndisappear before the end of the Triassic, and four march confidently across the boundary\ninto the Jurassic. Six, however, vanish at the boundary, or only just splutter across it; and\nthere appear from nowhere, almost as soon as the Jurassic begins.\nF\n \n1\n\nThat boundary itself is suggestive. The first geological indication of the impact that killed\nthe dinosaurs was an unusually high level of iridium in rocks at the end of the Cretaceous\nwhen the beasts disappear from the fossil record. Iridium is normally rare at the earth’s\nsurface, but it is more abundant in meteorites. When people began to believe the impact\ntheory, they started looking for other Cretaceous-and anomalies. One that turned up was a\nsurprising abundance of fern spores in rocks just above the boundary layer – a\nphenomenon known as a “fern spike”.\nG\nThat matched the theory nicely. Many modern ferns are opportunists. They cannot\ncompete against plants with leaves, but if a piece of land is cleared by, say, a volcanic\neruption, they are often the first things to set up shop there. An asteroid strike would have\nscoured much of the earth of its vegetable cover, and provided a paradise for ferns. A fern\nspike in the rocks is thus a good indication that something terrible has happened.\nH\nBoth an iridium anomaly and a fern spike appear in rocks at the end of the Triassic, too.\nThat accounts for the disappearing ichnotaxa: the creatures that made them did not survive\nthe holocaust. The surprise is how rapidly the new ichnotaxa appear.\nI\nDr Olsen and his colleagues suggest that the explanation for this rapid increase in size may\nbe a phenomenon called ecological release. This is seen today when reptiles (which, in\nmodern times, tend to be small creatures) reach islands where they face no competitors.\nThe most spectacular example is on the Indonesian island of Komodo, where local lizards\nhave grown so large that they are often referred to as dragons. The dinosaurs, in other\nwords, could flourish only when the competition had been knocked out.\nJ\nThat leaves the question of where the impact happened. No large hole in the earth’s crust\nseems to be 202m years old. It may, of course, have been overlooked. Old craters are\neroded and buried, and not always easy to find. Alternatively, it may have vanished.\nAlthough the continental crust is more or less permanent, the ocean floor is constantly\nrecycled by the tectonic processes that bring about continental drift. There is no ocean floor\nleft that is more than 200m years old, so a crater that formed in the ocean would have been\nswallowed up by now.\nK\nThere is a third possibility, however. This is that the crater is known, but has been\nmisdated. The Manicouagan “structure”, a crater in Quebec, is thought to be 214m years\nold. It is huge – some 100km across – and seems to be the largest of between three and\nfive craters that formed within a few hours of each other as the lumps of a disintegrated\ncomet hit the earth one by one.\n \n2",
