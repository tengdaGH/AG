  "passage_text": "Reading Practice\n \nBring back the big cats\nIt's time to start returning vanished native animals to Britain, says John Vesty There is a\npoem, written around 598 AD, which describes hunting a mystery animal called a llewyn.\nBut what was it? Nothing seemed to fit, until 2006, when an animal bone, dating from\naround the same period, was found in the Kinsey Cave in northern England. Until this\ndiscovery, the lynx - a large spotted cat with tassel led ears - was presumed to have died\nout in Britain at least 6,000 years ago, before the inhabitants of these islands took up\nfarming. But the 2006 find, together with three others in Yorkshire and Scotland, is\ncompelling evidence that the lynx and the mysterious llewyn were in fact one and the same\nanimal. If this is so, it would bring forward the tassel-eared cat's estimated extinction date\nby roughly 5,000 years.\nHowever, this is not quite the last glimpse of the animal in British culture. A 9th- century\nstone cross from the Isle of Eigg shows, alongside the deer, boar and aurochs pursued by\na mounted hunter, a speckled cat with tasselled ears. Were it not for the animal's backside\nhaving worn away with time, we could have been certain, as the lynx's stubby tail is\nunmistakable. But even without this key feature, it's hard to see what else the creature\ncould have been. The lynx is now becoming the totemic animal of a movement that is\ntransforming British environmentalism: rewilding.\nRewilding means the mass restoration of damaged ecosystems. It involves letting trees\nreturn to places that have been denuded, allowing parts of the seabed to recover from\ntrawling and dredging, permitting rivers to flow freely again. Above all, it means bringing\nback missing species. One of the most striking findings of modern ecology is that\necosystems without large predators behave in completely different ways from those that\nretain them Some of them drive dynamic processes that resonate through the whole food\nchain, creating niches for hundreds of species that might otherwise struggle to survive. The\nkillers turn out to be bringers of life.\nSuch findings present a big challenge to British conservation, which has often selected\narbitrary assemblages of plants and animals and sought, at great effort and expense, to\nprevent them from changing. It has tried to preserve the living world as if it were a jar of\npickles, letting nothing in and nothing out, keeping nature in a state of arrested\ndevelopment. But ecosystems are not merely collections of species; they are also the\ndynamic and ever-shifting relationships between them. And this dynamism often depends\non large predators.\nAt sea the potential is even greater: by protecting large areas from commercial fishing, we\ncould once more see what 18th-century literature describes: vast shoals of fish being\nchased by fin and sperm whales, within sight of the English shore. This policy would also\ngreatly boost catches in the surrounding seas; the fishing industry's insistence on scouring\nevery inch of seabed, leaving no breeding reserves, could not be more damaging to its own\ninterests.\nRewilding is a rare example of an environmental movement in which campaigners\narticulate what they are for rather than only what they are against. One of the reasons why\nthe enthusiasm for rewilding is spreading so quickly in Britain is that it helps to create a\nmore inspiring vision than the green movement's usual promise of 'Follow us and the world\nwill be slightly less awful than it would otherwise have been.\n \n1\n\nThe lynx presents no threat to human beings: there is no known instance of one preying on\npeople. It is a specialist predator of roe deer, a species that has exploded in Britain in\nrecent decades, holding back, by intensive browsing, attempts to re-establish forests. It will\nalso winkle out sika deer: an exotic species that is almost impossible for human beings to\ncontrol, as it hides in impenetrable plantations of young trees. The attempt to reintroduce\nthis predator marries well with the aim of bringing forests back to parts of our bare and\nbarren uplands. The lynx requires deep cover, and as such presents little risk to sheep and\nother livestock, which are supposed, as a condition of farm subsidies, to be kept out of the\nwoods.\nOn a recent trip to the Cairngorm Mountains, I heard several conservationists suggest that\nthe lynx could be reintroduced there within 20 years. If trees return to the bare hills\nelsewhere in Britain, the big cats could soon follow. There is nothing extraordinary about\nthese proposals, seen from the perspective of anywhere else in Europe. The lynx has now\nbeen reintroduced to the Jura Mountains, the Alps, the Vosges in eastern France and the\nHarz mountains in Germany, and has re-established itself in many more places. The\nEuropean population has tripled since 1970 to roughly 10,000. As with wolves, bears,\nbeavers, boar, bison, moose and many other species, the lynx has been able to spread as\nfarming has,left the hills and people discover that it is more lucrative to protect charismatic\nwildlife than to hunt it, as tourists will pay for the chance to see it. Large-scale rewilding is\nhappening almost everywhere - except Britain.\nHere, attitudes are just beginning to change. Conservationists are starting to accept that\nthe old preservation-jar model is failing, even on its own terms. Already, projects such as\nTrees for Life in the Highlands provide a hint of what might be coming. An organisation is\nbeing set up that will seek to catalyse the rewilding of land and sea across Britain, its aim\nbeing to reintroduce that rarest of species to British ecosystems: hope.\n \n2",
