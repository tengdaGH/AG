  "passage_text": "Reading Practice\n \nThe True Cost of Food\nA\nFor more than forty years the cost of food has been rising. It has now reached a point\nwhere a growing number of people believe that it is far too high, and that bringing it down\nwill be one of the great challenges of the twenty first century. That cost, however, is not\nin immediate cash. In the West at least, most food is now far cheaper to buy in relative\nterms than it was in 1960.\nThe cost is in the collateral damage of the very methods of food production that have made\nthe food cheaper: in the pollution of water, the enervation of soil, the destruction of wildlife,\nthe harm to animal welfare and the threat to human health caused by modern industrial\nagriculture.\nB\nFirst mechanisation, then mass use of chemical fertilisers and pesticides, then\nmonocultures, then battery rearing of livestock, and now genetic engineering - the onward\nmarch of intensive farming has seemed unstoppable in the last half-century, as the yields\nof produce have soared. But the damage it has caused has been colossal. In Britain, for\nexample, many of our best-loved farmland birds, such as the skylark, the grey partridge,\nthe lapwing and the corn bunting, have vanished from huge stretches of countryside, as\nhave even more wild flowers and insects. This is a direct result of the way we have\nproduced our food in the last four decades. Thousands of miles of hedgerows, thousands\nof ponds, have disappeared from the landscape. The faecal filth of salmon farming has\ndriven wild salmon from many of the sea lochs and rivers of Scotland. Natural soil fertility is\ndropping in many areas because of continuous industrial fertiliser and pesticide use, while\nthe growth of algae is increasing in lakes because of the fertiliser run-off.\nC\nPut it all together and it looks like a battlefield, but consumers rarely make the connection\nat the dinner table. That is mainly because the costs of all this damage are what\neconomists refer to as externalities: they are outside the main transaction, which is for\nexample producing and selling a field of wheat, and are borne directly by neither producers\nnor consumers. To many, the costs may not even appear to be financial at all, but merely\naesthetic - a terrible shame, but nothing to do with money. And anyway they, as consumers\nof food, certainly aren’t paying for it, are they?\nD\nBut the costs to society can actually be quantified and, when added up, can amount to\nstaggering sums. A remarkable exercise in doing this has been carried out by one of the\nworld’s leading thinkers on the future of agriculture, Professor Jules Pretty, Director of the\nCentre for Environment and Society at the University of Essex. Professor Pretty and his\ncolleagues calculated the externalities of British agriculture for one particular year. They\nadded up the costs of repairing the damage it caused, and came up with a total figure of\n£2,343m. This is equivalent to £208 for every hectare of arable land and permanent\npasture, almost as much again as the total government and EU spend on British farming in\n \n1\n\nthat year. And according to Professor Pretty, it was a conservative estimate.\nE\nThe costs included: £120m for removal of pesticides; £16m for removal of nitrates; £55m\nfor removal of phosphates and soil; £23m for the removal of the bug Cryptosporidium from\ndrinking water by water companies; £125m for damage to wildlife habitats, hedgerows and\ndry stone walls; £1,113m from emissions of gases likely to contribute to climate change;\n£106m from soil erosion and organic carbon losses; £169m from food poisoning; and\n£607m from cattle disease. Professor Pretty draws a simple but memorable conclusion\nfrom all this: our food bills are actually threefold. We are paying for our supposedly cheaper\nfood in three separate ways: once over the counter, secondly through our taxes, which\nprovide the enormous subsidies propping up modern intensive farming, and thirdly to clean\nup the mess that modern farming leaves behind.\nF\nSo can the true cost of food be brought down? Breaking away from industrial agriculture as\nthe solution to hunger may be very hard for some countries, but in Britain, where\nthe immediate need to supply food is less urgent, and the costs and the damage\nof intensive farming have been clearly seen, it may be more feasible. The\ngovernment needs to create sustainable, competitive and diverse farming and food sectors,\nwhich will contribute to a thriving and sustainable rural economy, and advance\nenvironmental, economic, health, and animal welfare goals.\nG\nBut if industrial agriculture is to be replaced, what is a viable alternative? Professor Pretty\nfeels that organic farming would be too big a jump in thinking and in practices for many\nfarmers. Furthermore, the price premium would put the produce out of reach of many\npoorer consumers. He is recommending the immediate introduction of a'Greener Food\nStandard’, which would push the market towards more sustainable environmental practices\nthan the current norm, while not requiring the full commitment to organic production. Such\na standard would comprise agreed practices for different kinds of farming, covering\nagrochemical use, soil health, land management, water and energy use, food safety and\nanimal health. It could go a long way, he says, to shifting consumers as well as farmers\ntowards a more sustainable system of agriculture.\n \n2",
