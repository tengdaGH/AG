  "passage_text": "Reading Practice\n \n \nSunny Days For Silicon\n \nA The old saw that \"the devil is in the details\" characterizes the kind of needling obstacles\nthat prevent an innovative concept from becoming a working technology. It also often\ndescribes the type of problems that must be overcome to shave cost from the resulting\nproduct so that people will buy it. Emanuel Sachs of the Massachusetts Institute of\nTechnology has struggled with many such little devils in his career-tong endeavor to\ndevelop low-cost, high-efficiency solar cells. In his latest effort, Sachs has found\nincremental ways to boost the amount of electricity that common photovoltaics (PVs)\ngenerate from sunlight without increasing the costs. Specifically, he has raised the\nconversion efficiency of test cells made from multi-crystalline silicon from the typical 15.5\npercent to nearly 20 percent—on par with pricier single-crystal silicon cells. Such\nimprovements could bring the cost of PV power down from the current $1.90 to $2.10 per\nwatt to $1.65 per watt. With additional tweaks, Sachs anticipates creating within Four years\nsolar cells that can produce juice at a dollar per watt, a feat that would make electricity (rum\nthe sun competitive with that from coal-burning power plants.\n \nB Most PV cells, such as those on home rooftops, rely on silicon to convert sunlight into\nelectric current. Metal interconnects then funnel the electricity out from the silicon to power\ndevices or to feed an electrical grid. Since solar cells became practical and affordable three\ndecades ago, engineers have mostly favored using single-crystal silicon as the active\nmaterial, says Michael Rogol, managing director of Germany- based Photon Consulting.\nWafers of the substance are typically sawed from an ingot consisting of one large crystal\nthat has been pulled like taffy out of a vat of molten silicon. Especially at first, the high-\npurity ingots were left over from integrated-circuit manufacture, but later the process was\nused to make PV cells themselves, Rogol recounts. Although single-crystal cells offer high\nconversion efficiencies, they are expensive to make. The alternatives- multi-crystalline\nsilicon cells, which factories fabricate from lower-purity, cast ingots composed of many\nsmaller crystals—are cheaper to make, but unfortunately they are less efficient than single-\ncrystal cells.\n \nC Sachs, who has pioneered several novel ways to make silicon solar cells less costly and\nmore effective, recently turned his focus to the details of multi-crystalline silicon cell\nmanufacture. The first small improvement concerns the little silver fingers that gather\nelectric current from the surface of the bulk silicon,\" he explains. In conventional fabrication\nprocesses, cell manufacturers use screen-printing techniques (\"like high-accuracy silk-\nscreening of T-shirts,\" Sachs notes) and inks containing, silver particles to create these bus\nwires. The trouble is that standard silver wires come out wide and short, about 120 by 10\nmicrons, and include many nonconductive voids. As a result, they block considerable\nsunlight and do not carry as much current as they should.\nD At his start-up company—Lexington, Mass- based 1366 Technologies (the number refers\nto the flux of sunlight that strikes the earth's outer atmosphere: 1.366 watts per square\nmeter)—Sachs is employing \"a proprietary wet process that can produce thinner and taller\"\nwires that are 20 by 20 microns. The slimmer bus wires use less costly silver and can be\nplaced closer together so they can draw more current from the neighboring active material,\nthrough which free electrons can travel only so far. At the same time, the wires block less\nincoming light than their standard counterparts.\n \n1\n\n \n \nE The second innovation alters the wide, flat interconnect wires that collect current from the\nsilver bus wires and electrically link adjacent cells. Interconnect wires at the top can shade\nas much as 5 percent of the area of a cell. \"We place textured mirror surfaces on the faces\nof these rolled wires. These little mirrors reflect incoming light at a lower angle--around 30\ndegrees-—so that when the reflected rays hit the glass layer at Lire top, they stay within the\nsilicon wafer by way of total internal reflection,” Sachs explains. (Divers and snorkelers\ncommonly see this optical effect when they view water surfaces from below.) The longer\nthat light remains inside, the more chance it has to be absorbed and transformed into\nelectricity.\n \nF Sachs expects that new antireflection coatings will further raise multi-crystal line cell\nefficiencies. One of his firm's future goals will be a switch from expensive silver bus wires\nto cheaper copper ones. And he has a few ideas regarding how to successfully make the\nsubstitution. \"Unlike silver, copper poisons the performance of silicon PVs,\" Sachs says,\n\"so it will be crucial to include a low-cost diffusion barrier that stops direct contact between\ncopper and the silicon.\" In this business, it's always the little devilish details that count.\nG The cost of silicon solar cells is likely to fall as bulk silicon prices drop, according to the\nU.S. Energy information Administration and the industry tracking firm Solarbuzz. A steep\nrise in solar panel sales in recent years had led to a global shortage of silicon because\nproduction capacity for the active material lagged behind, but now new silicon\nmanufacturing plants are coming online. The reduced materials costs and resulting lower\nsystem prices will greatly boost demand for solar-electric technology, according to market\nwatcher Michael Rogol of Photon Consulting.\n \n2",
