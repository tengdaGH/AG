  "passage_text": "Reading Practice\n \nThe Power of Nothing\nGeoff Watts, New Scientist (May 26th, 2001)\nA\nWant to devise a new form of alternative medicine? No problem. Here is the recipe. Be\nwarm, sympathetic, reassuring and enthusiastic. Your treatment should involve physical\ncontact, and each session with your patients should last at least half an hour. Encourage\nyour patients to take an active part in their treatment and understand how their disorders\nrelate to the rest of their lives. Tell them that their own bodies possess the true power to\nheal. Make them pay you out of their own pockets. Describe your treatment in familiar\nwords, but embroidered with a hint of mysticism: energy fields, energy flows, energy\nblocks, meridians, forces, auras, rhythms and the like. Refer to the knowledge of an earlier\nage: wisdom carelessly swept aside by the rise and rise of blind, mechanistic science. Oh,\ncome off it, you are saying. Something invented off the top of your head could not possibly\nwork, could it?\nB\nWell yes, it could – and often well enough to earn you a living. A good living if you are\nsufficiently convincing, or better still, really believe in your therapy. Many illnesses get\nbetter on their own, so if you are lucky and administer your treatment at just the right time\nyou will get the credit. But that’s only part of it. Some of the improvement really would be\ndown to you. Your healing power would be the outcome of a paradoxical force that\nconventional medicine recognizes but remains oddly ambivalent about: the placebo effect.\nC\nPlacebos are treatments that have no direct effect on the body, yet still, work because the\npatient has faith in their power to heal. Most often the term refers to a dummy pill, but it\napplies just as much to any device or procedure, from a sticking plaster to a crystal to an\noperation. The existence of the placebo effect implies that even quackery may confer real\nbenefits, which is why any mention of placebo is a touchy subject for many practitioners of\ncomplementary and alternative medicine, who are likely to regard it as tantamount to a\ncharge of charlatanism. In fact, the placebo effect is a powerful part of all medical care,\northodox or otherwise, though its role is often neglected or misunderstood.\nD\nOne of the great strengths of CAM may be its practitioners’ skill in deploying the placebo\neffect to accomplish real healing. “Complementary practitioners are miles better at\nproducing non-specific effects and good therapeutic relationships,” says Edzard Ernst,\nprofessor of CAM at Exeter University. The question is whether CAM could be integrated\ninto conventional medicines, as some would like, without losing much of this power.\nE\nAt one level, it should come as no surprise that our state of mind can influence our\nphysiology: anger opens the superficial blood vessels of the face; sadness pumps the tear\nglands. But exactly how placebos work their medical magic is still largely unknown. Most of\n \n1\n\nthe scant research done so far has focused on the control of pain because it’s one of the\ncommonest complaints and lends itself to experimental study. Here, attention has turned to\nthe endorphins, morphine-like neurochemicals known to help control pain.\nF\nBut exactly how placebos work their medical magic is still largely unknown. Most of the\nscant research to date has focused on the control of pain because it’s one of the\ncommonest complaints and lends itself to experimental study. Here, attention has turned to\nthe endorphins, natural counterparts of morphine that are known to help control pain. “Any\nof the neurochemicals involved in transmitting pain impulses or modulating them might also\nbe involved in generating the placebo response,” says Don Price, an oral surgeon at the\nUniversity of Florida who studies the placebo effect in dental pain.\nG\n“But endorphins are still out in front.” That case has been strengthened by the recent work\nof Fabrizio Benedetti of the University of Turin, who showed that the placebo effect can be\nabolished by a drug, naloxone, which blocks the effects of endorphins. Benedetti induced\npain in human volunteers by inflating a blood-pressure cuff on the forearm. He did this\nseveral times a day for several days, using morphine each time to control the pain. On the\nfinal day, without saying anything, he replaced the morphine with a saline solution. This still\nrelieved the subjects’ pain: a placebo effect. But when he added naloxone to the saline the\npain relief disappeared. Here was direct proof that placebo analgesia is mediated, at least\nin part, by these natural opiates.\nH\nStill, no one knows how belief triggers endorphin release, or why most people can’t achieve\nplacebo pain relief simply by willing it. Though scientists don’t know exactly how placebos\nwork, they have accumulated a fair bit of knowledge about how to trigger the effect. A\nLondon rheumatologist found, for example, that red dummy capsules made more effective\npainkillers than blue, green or yellow ones. Research on American students revealed that\nblue pills make better sedatives than pink, a colour more suitable for stimulants. Even\nbranding can make a difference: if Aspro or Tylenol is what you like to take for a headache,\ntheir chemically identical generic equivalents may be less effective.\nI\nIt matters, too, how the treatment is delivered. Decades ago, when the major tranquilliser\nchlorpromazine was being introduced, a doctor in Kansas categorised his colleagues\naccording to whether they were keen on it, openly skeptical of its benefits, or took a “let’s\ntry and see” attitude. His conclusion: the more enthusiastic the doctor, the better the drug\nperformed. And this year Ernst surveyed published studies that compared doctors’ bedside\nmanners. The studies turned up one consistent finding: “Physicians who adopt a warm,\nfriendly and reassuring manner,” he reported, “are more effective than those whose\nconsultations are formal and do not offer reassurance.”\nJ\nWarm, friendly and reassuring are precisely CAM’s strong suits, of course. Many of the\ningredients of that opening recipe – the physical contact, the generous swathes of time, the\nstrong hints of supernormal healing power – are just the kind of thing likely to impress\n \n2\n\npatients. It’s hardly surprising, then, that complementary practitioners are generally best at\nmobilising the placebo effect, says Arthur Kleinman, professor of social anthropology at\nHarvard University.\n \n3",
