Actually, unite a lot, says Simon Birch.\nWhen scientists from London’s Natural History Museum descended on the coffee farms of\nthe tiny Central American republic of F.l Salvador, they were astonished to find such\ndiversity of insect and plant species. During 18 months' work on 12 farms, they found a\nthird more species of parasitic wasp than arc known to exist in the whole country of Costa\nRica. They described four new species and are aware of a fifth. On 24 farms they found\nnearly 300 species of tree when they had expected to find about 100.\nEl Salvador has lost much of its natural forest, with coffee farms covering nearly 10% of the\ncountry. Most of them use the ‘shade-grown’ method of production, which utilises a semi-\nnatural forest ecosystem. Alex Munro, the museum’s botanist on the expedition, says: ‘Our\nfindings amazed our insect specialist. There’s a very sophisticated food web present. The\nwasps, for instance, may depend on specific species of tree.’\nIt's the same the world over. Species diversity is much higher where coffee is grown in\nshade conditions. In addition, coffee (and chocolate) is usually grow n in tropical rainforest\nregions that are biodiversity hotspots. ‘These habitats support up to 70% of the planets\nplant and animal species, and so the production methods of cocoa and coffee can have a\nhugely significant impact,' explains Dr Paul Donald of the Royal Society for the. Protection\nof Birds.\nSo what does ‘shade-grown’ mean, and why is it good for wildlife? Most of the world's\ncoffee is produced by poor farmers in the developing world. Traditionally they have grown\ncoffee (and cocoa) under the shade of selectively thinned tracts of rain forest in a genuinely\nsustainable form of farming. Leaf fall from the canopy provides a supply of nutrients and\nacts as a mulch that suppresses weeds. The insects that live in the canopy pollinate the\ncocoa and coffee and prey on pests. The trees also provide farmers with fruit and wood for\nfuel. \nBird diversity in shade-grown coffee plantations rivals that found in natural forests in the\nsame region.’ says Robert Rice from the Smithsonian Migratory Bird Center. In Ghana,\nWest Africa. - one of the world's biggest producers of cocoa - 90% of the cocoa is grown\nunder shade, and these forest plantations are a vital habitat for wintering European migrant\nbirds. In the same way. the coffee forests of Central and South America are a refuge for\nwintering North American migrants.\nMore recently, a combination of the collapse in the world market for coffee and cocoa and a\ndrive to increase yields by producer countries has led to huge swathes of shade-grown\ncoffee and cocoa being cleared to make way for a highly intensive, monoculture pattern of\nproduction known as ‘full sun’. But this system not only reduces the diversity of flora and\nfauna, it also requires huge amounts of pesticides and fertilisers. In Cote d’Ivoire, which\nproduces more than half the world's cocoa, more than a third of the crop is now grown in\nfull-sun conditions. \nThe loggers have been busy in the Americas too, where nearly 70% of all Colombian\ncoffee is now produced using full-sun production. One study carried out in Colombia and\n \n1\n\nMexico found that, compared with shade coffee, full-sun plantations have 95% fewer\nspecies of birds.\nIn LI Salvador. Alex Munro says shade-coffee farms have a cultural as well as ecological\nsignificance and people are not happy to see them go. But the financial pressures are\ngreat, and few of these coffee farms make much money. ‘One farm we studied, a\ncooperative of 100 families, made just S 10,000 a year S100 per family and that's not\ntaking labour costs into account.’\nThe loss of shade-coffee forests has so alarmed a number of North American wildlife\norganisations that they 're now harnessing consumer power to help save these threatened\nhabitats. They are promoting a ‘certification' system that can indicate to consumers that the\nbeans have been grown on shade plantations. Bird-friendly coffee, for instance, is\nmarketed by the Smithsonian Migratory Bird Center. The idea is that the small extra cost is\npassed directly on to the coffee farmers as a financial incentive to maintain their shade-\ncoffee farms.\nNot all conservationists agree with such measures, however. Some say certification could\nbe leading to the loss not preservation of natural forests. John Rappole of the Smithsonian\nConservation and Research Center, for example, argues that shade- grown marketing\nprovides ‘an incentive to convert existing areas of primary forest that are too remote or\nsteep to be converted profitably to other forms of cultivation into shade-coffee plantations’.\nOther conservationists, such as Stacey Philpott and colleagues, argue the case for shade\ncoffee. But there are different types of shade growing. Those used by subsistence farmers\nare virtually identical to natural forest (and have a corresponding diversity), while systems\nthat use coffee plants as the understorey and cacao or citrus trees as the overstorey may\nbe no more diverse than full-sun farms. Certification procedures need to distinguish\nbetween the two. and Ms Philpott argues that as long as the process is rigorous and offers\nfinancial gains to the producers, shade growing does benefit the environment.\n \n2",
