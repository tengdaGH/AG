  "passage_text": "Reading Practice\n \nHighs & Lows\nHormone levels - and hence our moods -may be affected by the weather. Gloomy weather\ncan cause depression, but sunshine appears to raise the spirits. In Britain, for example, the\ndull weather of winter drastically cuts down the amount of sunlight that is experienced\nwhich strongly affects some people. They become so depressed and lacking in energy that\ntheir work and social life are affected. This condition has been given the name SAD\n(Seasonal Affective Disorder). Sufferers can fight back by making the most of any sunlight\nin winter and by spending a few hours each day under special, full-spectrum lamps. These\nprovide more ultraviolet and blue-green light than ordinary fluorescent and tungsten lights.\nSome Russian scientists claim that children learn better after being exposed to ultraviolet\nlight. In warm countries, hours of work are often arranged so that workers can take a break,\nor even a siesta, during the hottest part of the day. Scientists are working to discover the\nlinks between the weather and human beings' moods and performance.\nIt is generally believed that tempers grow shorter in hot, muggy weather. There is no doubt\nthat 'crimes against the person' rise in the summer, when the weather is hotter and fall in\nthe winter when the weather is colder. Research in the United States has shown a\nrelationship between temperature and street riots. The frequency of riots rises dramatically\nas the weather gets warmer, hitting a peak around 27-30°C. But is this effect really due to a\nmood change caused by the heat? Some scientists argue that trouble starts more often in\nhot weather merely because there are more people in the street when the weather is good.\nPsychologists have also studied how being cold affects performance. Researchers\ncompared divers working in icy cold water at 5°C with others in water at 20°C (about\nswimming pool temperature). The colder water made the divers worse at simple arithmetic\nand other mental tasks. But significantly, their performance was impaired as soon as they\nwere put into the cold water - before their bodies had time to cool down. This suggests that\nthe low temperature did not slow down mental functioning directly, but the feeling of cold\ndistracted the divers from their tasks.\nPsychologists have conducted studies showing that people become less sceptical and\nmore optimistic when the weather is sunny However, this apparently does not just depend\non the temperature. An American psychologist studied customers in a temperature-\ncontrolled restaurant. They gave bigger tips when the sun was shining and smaller tips\nwhen it wasn't, even though the temperature in the restaurant was the same. A link\nbetween weather and mood is made believable by the evidence for a connection between\nbehaviour and the length of the daylight hours. This in turn might involve the level of a\nhormone called melatonin, produced in the pineal gland in the brain. The amount of\nmelatonin falls with greater exposure to daylight. Research shows that melatonin plays an\nimportant part in the seasonal behaviour of certain animals. For example, food\nconsumption of stags increases during the winter, reaching a peak in February/ March. It\nfalls again to a low point in May, then rises to a peak in September, before dropping to\nanother minimum in November. These changes seem to be triggered by varying melatonin\nlevels.\nIn the laboratory, hamsters put on more weight when the nights are getting shorter and\ntheir melatonin levels are falling. On the other hand, if they are given injections of\nmelatonin, they will stop eating altogether. It seems that time cues provided by the\n \n1\n\n \nchanging lengths of day and night trigger changes in animals' behaviour - changes that are\nneeded to cope with the cycle of the seasons. People's moods too, have been shown to\nreact to the length of the daylight hours. Sceptics might say that longer exposure to\nsunshine puts people in a better mood because they associate it with the happy feelings of\nholidays and freedom from responsibility. However, the belief that rain and murky weather\nmake people more unhappy is borne out by a study in Belgium, which showed that a\ntelephone counselling service gets more telephone calls from people with suicidal feelings\nwhen it rains.\nWhen there is a thunderstorm brewing, some people complain of the air being 'heavy' and\nof feeling irritable, moody and on edge. They may be reacting to the fact that the air can\nbecome slightly positively charged when large thunderclouds are generating the intense\nelectrical fields that cause lightning flashes. The positive charge increases the levels of\nserotonin (a chemical involved in sending signals in the nervous system). High levels of\nserotonin in certain areas of the nervous system make people more active and reactive\nand, possibly, more aggressive. When certain winds are blowing, such as the Mistral in\nsouthern France and the Fohn in southern Germany, mood can be affected - and the\nnumber of traffic accidents rises. It may be significant that the concentration of positively\ncharged particles is greater than normal in these winds. In the United Kingdom, 400,000\nionizers are sold every year. These small machines raise the number of negative ions in\nthe air in a room. Many people claim they feel better in negatively charged air. \n \n2",
