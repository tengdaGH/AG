Christian Amodeo reports on the growth of\npolar tourism.\nTravel at the North and South Poles has become an expensive leisure activity, suitable for\ntourists of all ages. The poles may be inhospitable places, but they are seeing increasing\nnumbers of visitors.\nAnnual figures for the Arctic, where tourism has existed since the 19th century, have\nincreased from about a million in the early 1990s to more than 1.5 million today. This is\npartly because of the lengthening summer season brought about by climate change.\nMost visitors arrive by ship. In 2007, 370,000 cruise passengers visited Norway, twice the\nnumber that arrived in 2000. Iceland, a country where tourism is the second-largest\nindustry, has enjoyed an annual growth rate of nine percent since 1990. Meanwhile, Alaska\nreceived some 1,029,800 passengers, a rise of 7.3 percent from 2006. Greenland has seen\nthe most rapid growth in marine tourism, with a sharp increase in cruise-ship arrivals of 250\npercent since 2004.\nThe global economic downturn may have affected the annual 20.6 percent rate of increase\nin visitors to the Antarctic - last season saw a drop of 17 percent to 38,200 - but there has\nbeen a 760 percent rise in land-based tourism there since 1997. More people than ever are\nlanding at fragile sites, with light aircraft, helicopters and all-terrain vehicles increasingly\nused for greater access, while in the past two seasons, ‘fly-sail’ operations have begun.\nThese deliver tourists by air to ships, so far more groups can enjoy a cruise in a season;\nlarge cruise ships capable of carrying up to 800 passengers are not uncommon.\n \n \nIn addition, it seems that a high number of visitors return to the poles. ‘Looking at six years’\nworth of data, of the people who have been to the polar regions, roughly 25 percent go for\na second time,’ says Louisa Richardson, a senior marketing executive at tour operator\nExodus.\nIn the same period that tourism has exploded, the ‘health’ of the poles has\n‘deteriorated’. ‘The biggest changes taking place in the Antarctic are related to climate\nchange,’ says Rod Downie, Environmental Manager with the British Antarctic Survey\n(BAS).

At the meeting of the Antarctic Treaty in Baltimore, the 28 member nations\nadopted proposals for limits to tourist numbers.

They\nagreed to prevent ships with more than 500 passengers from landing in Antarctica, as well\nas limit the number of passengers going ashore to a maximum of 100 at any one time, with\na minimum of one guide for every 20 tourists. ‘Tourism in Antarctica is not without its risks,’\nsays Downie.
