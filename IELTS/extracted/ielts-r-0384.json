Leatherback turtles follow the general sea turtle body plan of having a large,\nflattened, round body with two pairs of very large flippers and a short tail. Like other\nsea turtles, the leatherback’s flattened forelimbs are adapted for swimming in the\nopen ocean. Claws are absent from both pairs of flippers. The Leatherback’s flippers\narc the largest in proportion to its body among extant sea turtles. Leatherback’s front\nflippers can grow up to 2.7 meters (9 ft) in large specimens, the largest flippers (even\nin comparison to its body) of any sea turtle. As the last surviving member of its family,\nthe leatherback turtle has several distinguishing characteristics that differentiate it\nfrom other sea turtles. Its most notable feature is that it lacks the bony carapace of\nthe other extant sea turtles.\nB. During the past month, four turtles have washed up along Irish coasts from Wexford\nto Kerry. These turtles arc more typical of warmer waters and only occur in Irish\nwaters when they stray off course. It is likely that they may have originated from\nFlorida, America. Two specimens have been taken to Coastal and Marine Resources\nCentre (stored at the National Maritime College), University College Cork, where a\nnecropsy (post mortem for animals) will be conducted to establish their age, sex and\ntheir exact origin. During this same period, two leatherback turtles were found in\nScotland, and a rare Kemp’s Ridley turtle was found in Wales, thus making it an\nexceptional month for stranded turtles in Ireland and the UK.\nC. Actually, There has been extensive research conducted regarding the sea turtles’\nabilities to return to their nesting regions and sometimes exact locations from\nhundreds of miles away. In the water, their path is greatly affected by powerful\ncurrents. Despite their limited vision, and lack of landmarks in the open water, turtles\nare able to retrace their migratory paths. Some explanations of this phenomenon\nhave found that sea turtles can detect the angle and intensity of the earth’s magnetic\nfields.\nD. However, Loggerhead turtles are not normally found in Irish waters, because water\ntemperatures here are far too cold for their survival. Instead, adult loggerheads prefer\nthe warmers waters of the Mediterranean, the Caribbean and North America’s east\ncoast. The four turtles that were found have probably originated from the North\nAmerican population of loggerheads. However it will require genetic analysis to\nconfirm this assumption. It is thought that after leaving their nesting beach as\nhatchlings (when they measure 4.5 cm in length), these tiny turtles enter the North\nAtlantic Gyre (a giant circular ocean current) that takes them from America, across to\nEurope (Azores area), down towards North Africa, before being transported back\nagain to America via a different current.
