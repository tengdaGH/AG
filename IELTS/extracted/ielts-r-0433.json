It boasted its own ‘national health service’, and left behind the teachings\nof the incomparable Sun Simiao\nIf no further evidence was available of the sophistication of China in the Tang era, then a\nlook at Chinese medicine would be sufficient. At the Western end of the Eurasian continent\nthe Roman empire had vanished, and there was nowhere new to claim the status of the\ncultural and political centre of the world. In fact, for a few centuries, this centre happened to\nbe the capital of the Tang empire, and Chinese medicine under the Tang was far ahead of\nits European counterpart. The organisational context of health and healing was structured\nto a degree that had no precedence in Chinese history and found no parallel elsewhere.\nAn Imperial Medical Office had been inherited from previous dynasties: it was immediately\nrestructured and staffed with directors and deputy directors, chief and assistant medical\ndirectors, pharmacists and curators of medicinal herb gardens and further personnel.\nWithin the first two decades after consolidating its rule, the Tang administration set up one\ncentral and several provincial medical colleges with professors, lecturers, clinical\npractitioners and pharmacists to train students in one or all of the four departments of\nmedicine, acupuncture, physical therapy and exorcism.\nPhysicians were given positions in governmental medical service only after passing\nqualifying examinations. They were remunerated in accordance with the number of cures\nthey had effected during the past year.\nIn 723 Emperor Xuanzong personally composed a general formulary of prescriptions\nrecommended to him by one of his imperial pharmacists and sent it to all the provincial\nmedical schools. An Arabic traveller, who visited China in 851, noted with surprise that\nprescriptions from the emperor’s formulary were publicised on notice boards at crossroads\nto enhance the welfare of the population.\nThe government took care to protect the general populace from potentially harmful medical\npractice. The Tang legal code was the first in China to include laws concerned with harmful\nand heterodox medical practices. For example, to treat patients for money without adhering\nto standard procedures was defined as fraud combined with theft and had to be tried in\naccordance with the legal statutes on theft. If such therapies resulted in the death of a\npatient, the healer was to be banished for two and a half years. In case a physician\npurposely failed to practice according to the standards, he was to be tried in accordance\nwith the statutes on premeditated homicide. Even if no harm resulted, he was to be\nsentenced to sixty strokes with a heavy cane.\nIn fact, physicians practising during the Tang era had access to a wealth of pharmaceutical\nand medical texts, their contents ranging from purely pragmatic advice to highly\nsophisticated theoretical considerations. Concise descriptions of the position, morphology,\nand functions of the organs of the human body stood side by side in libraries with books\nenabling readers to calculate the daily, seasonal and annual climatic conditions of cycles of\nsixty years and to understand and predict their effects on health.\nSeveral Tang authors wrote large collections of prescriptions, continuing a literary tradition\n \n1\n\n \n \ndocumented since the 2nd century BC. The two most outstanding works to be named here\nwere those by Sun Simiao (581-682?) and Wang Tao (c.670-755). The latter was a\nlibrarian who copied more than six thousand formulas, categorised in 1,104 sections, from\nsixty-five older works and published them under the title Wciitai miyao. Twenty-four\nsections, for example, were devoted to ophthalmology. They reflect the Indian origin of\nmuch Chinese knowledge on ailments of the eye and, in particular, of cataract surgery.\nSun Simiao was the most eminent physician and author not only of the Tang dynasty, but\nof the entire first millennium AD. He was a broadly educated intellectual and physician; his\nworld view integrated notions of all three of the major currents competing at his time -\nConfucianism, Daoism and Buddhism. Sun Simiao gained fame during his lifetime as a\nclinician (he was summoned to the imperial court at least once) and as author of the\nPrescriptions Worth Thousands in Gold (Qianjinfang) and its sequel. In contrast to\ndevelopments in the 12th century, physicians relied on prescriptions and single substances\nto treat their patients’ illnesses. The theories of systematic correspondences, characteristic\nof the acupuncture tradition, had not been extended to cover pharmacology yet.\nSun Simiao rose to the pantheon of Chinese popular Buddhism in about the 13th century.\nHe was revered as paramount Medicine God. He gained this extraordinary position in\nChinese collective memory not only because he was an outstanding clinician and writer,\nbut also for his ethical concerns. Sun Simiao was the first Chinese author known to\ncompose an elaborate medical ethical code. Even though based on Buddhist and\nConfucian values, his deontology is comparable to the Hippocratic Oath. It initiated a\ndebate on the task of medicine, its professional obligations, social position and moral\njustification that continued until the arrival of Western medicine in the 19th century.\nDespite or - more likely - because of its long- lasting affluence and political stability, the\nTang dynasty did not add any significantly new ideas to the interpretation of illness, health\nand healing. Medical thought reflects human anxieties; changes in medical thought always\noccur in the context of new existential fears or of fundamentally changed social\ncircumstances. Nevertheless, medicine was a most fascinating ingredient of Tang\ncivilisation and it left a rich legacy to subsequent centuries.\n \n2",
