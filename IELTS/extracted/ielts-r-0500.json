  "passage_text": "Reading Practice\n \nThe Impact of the Potato\n \nJeff Chapman relates the story of history the most important vegetable\n \nA The potato was first cultivated in South America between three and seven thousand\nyears ago, though scientists believe they may have grown wild in the region as long as\n13,000 years ago. The genetic patterns of potato distribution indicate that the potato\nprobably originated in the mountainous west-central region of the continent.\n \nB Early Spanish chroniclers who misused the Indian word batata (sweet potato) as the\nname for the potato noted the importance of the tuber to the Incan Empire. The Incas had\nlearned to preserve the potato for storage by dehydrating and mashing potatoes into a\nsubstance called Chuchu could be stored in a room for up to 10 years, providing excellent\ninsurance against possible crop failures. As well as using the food as a staple crop,  the\nIncas thought potatoes made childbirth easier and used it to treat injuries.\n \nC The Spanish conquistadors first encountered the potato when they arrived in Peru in\n1532 in search of gold, and noted Inca miners eating chuchu. At the time the Spaniards\nfailed to realize that the potato represented a far more important treasure than either silver\nor gold, but they did gradually begin to use potatoes as basic rations aboard their ships.\nAfter the arrival of the potato in Spain in 1570a few Spanish farmers began to cultivate\nthem on a small scale, mostly as food for livestock.\n \nD Throughout Europe, potatoes were regarded with suspicion, distaste and fear. Generally\nconsidered to be unfit for human consumption, they were used only as animal fodder and\nsustenance for the starving. In northern Europe, potatoes were primarily grown in botanical\ngardens as an exotic novelty. Even peasants refused to eat from a plant that produced\nugly, misshapen tubers and that had come from a heathen civilization. Some felt that the\npotato plant’s resemblance to plants in the nightshade family hinted that it was the creation\nof witches or devils.\n \nE In meat-loving England, farmers and urban workers regarded potatoes with extreme\ndistaste. In 1662, the Royal Society recommended the cultivation of the tuber to the English\ngovernment and the nation, but this recommendation had little impact. Potatoes did not\nbecome a staple until, during the food shortages associated with the Revolutionary Wars,\nthe English government began to officially encourage potato cultivation. In 1795, the Board\nof Agriculture issued a pamphlet entitled “Hints Respecting the Culture and Use of\nPotatoes” this was followed shortly by pro-potato editorials and potato recipes in The\nTimes. Gradually, the lower classes began to follow the lead of the upper classes.\n \nF A similar pattern emerged across the English Channel in the Netherlands, Belgium and\nFrance. While the potato slowly gained ground in eastern France (where it was often the\nonly crop remaining after marauding soldiers plundered wheat fields and vineyards), it did\nnot achieve widespread acceptance until the late 1700s. The peasants remained\nsuspicious, in spite of a 1771 paper from the Facult de Paris testifying that the potato was\nnot harmful but beneficial. The people began to overcome their distaste when the plant\nreceived the royal seal of approval: Louis XVI began to sport a potato flower in his\nbuttonhole, and Marie-Antoinette wore the purple potato blossom in her hair.\nG Frederick the Great of Prussia saw the potato’s potential to help feed his nation and\n \n1\n\n \nlower the price of bread, but faced the challenge of overcoming the people’s prejudice\nagainst the plant. When he issued a 1774 order for his subjects to grow potatoes as\nprotection against famine, the town of Kolberg replied: “The things have neither smell nor\ntaste, not even the dogs will eat them, so what use are they to us?” Trying a less direct\napproach to encourage his subjects to begin planting potatoes, Frederick used a bit of\nreverse psychology: he planted a royal field of potato plants and stationed a heavy guard to\nprotect this field from thieves. Nearby peasants naturally assumed that anything worth\nguarding was worth stealing, and so snuck into the field and snatched the plants for their\nhome gardens. Of course, this was entirely in line with Frederick’s wishes.\n \nH Historians debate whether the potato was primarily a cause or an effect of the huge\npopulation boom in industrial-era England and Wales. Prior to 1800the English diet had\nconsisted primarily of meat, supplemented by bread, butter and cheese. Few vegetables\nwere consumed, most vegetables being regarded as nutritionally worthless and potentially\nharmful. This view began to change gradually in the late 1700s. The Industrial Revolution\nwas drawing an ever increasing percentage of the populace into crowded cities, where only\nthe richest could afford homes with ovens or coal storage rooms, and people were working\n12-16 hour days which left them with little time or energy to prepare food. High yielding,\neasily prepared potato crops were the obvious solution to England’s food problems.\n \nI Whereas most of their neighbors regarded the potato with suspicion and had to be\npersuaded to use it by the upper classes, the Irish peasantry embraced the tuber more\npassionately than anyone since the Incas. The potato was well suited to the Irish the soil\nand climate, and its high yield suited the most important concern of most Irish farmers: to\nfeed their families.\nJ The most dramatic example of the potato’s potential to alter population patterns occurred\nin Ireland, where the potato had become a staple by 1800. The Irish population doubled to\neight million between 1780 and 1841this without any significant expansion of industry or\nreform of agricultural techniques beyond the widespread cultivation of the potato. Though\nIrish landholding practices were primitive in comparison with those of England, the potato’s\nhigh yields allowed even the poorest farmers to produce more healthy food than they\nneeded with scarcely any investment or hard labor. Even children could easily plant,\nharvest and cook potatoes, which of course required no threshing, curing or grinding. The\nabundance provided by potatoes greatly decreased infant mortality and encouraged early\nmarriage.\n \n2",
