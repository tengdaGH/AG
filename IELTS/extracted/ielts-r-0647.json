It is recognised as\nbeing particularly conducive to enriching and enhancing the standing of tourism, on the\nbasis that this form of tourism respects the natural heritage and local populations and are in\nkeeping with the carrying capacity of the sites.\nB\nCuba\nCuba is undoubtedly an obvious site for ecotourism, with its picturesque beaches,\nunderwater beauty, countryside landscapes, and ecological reserves. An educated\npopulation and improved infrastructure of roads and communications add to the mix. In the\nCaribbean region, Cuba is now the second most popular tourist destination.\n \nEcotourism is also seen as an environmental education opportunity to heighten both\nvisitors’ and residents’ awareness of environmental and conservation issues, and even to\ninspire conservation action.\nEcotourism has also been credited with promoting peace, by providing opportunities for\neducational and cultural exchange. Tourists’ safety and health are guaranteed.\nRaul Castro, brother of the Cuban president, started this initiative to rescue the Cuban\ntradition of herbal medicine and provide natural medicines for its healthcare system. The\nschool at Las Terrazas Eco-Tourism Community teaches herbal healthcare and children\nlearn not only how to use medicinal herbs, but also to grow them in the school garden for\nteas, tinctures, ointments and creams.\nIn Cuba, ecotourism has the potential to alleviate poverty by bringing money into the\neconomy and creating jobs. In addition to the environmental impacts of these efforts, the\narea works on developing community employment opportunities for locals, in conjunction\nwith ecotourism.\nC\nSouth America\nIn terms of South America, it might be the place which shows the shortcoming of\necotourism. Histoplasma capsulatum (see chapter “Histoplasmosis and HIV”), a dimorphic\nfungus, is the most common endemic mycosis the United States,(12) and is associated\nwith exposure to a bat or bird droppings. Most recently, outbreaks have been reported in\nhealthy travelers who returned from Central and South America after engaging in\nrecreational activities associated with spelunking, adventure tourism, and ecotourism. It is\nquite often to see tourists neglected sanitation while travelling. After engaging in high-risk\nactivities, boots should be hosed off and clothing placed in airtight plastic bags for\nlaundering. HIV-infected travelers should avoid risky behaviors or environments, such as\n \n1\n\nexploring caves, particularly those that contain bat droppings.\nD\nNowhere is the keen eye and intimate knowledge of ecotourism are more amidst this\nfantastic biodiversity, as we explore remote realms rich in wildlife rather than a nature\nadventure. A sustainable tour is significant for ecotourism, one in which we can grow hand\nin hand with nature and our community, respecting everything that makes us privileged.\nTravelers get great joy from every step that takes forward on this endless but exciting\njourney towards sustainability. The primary threats to South American’s tropical forests are\ndeforestation caused by agricultural expansion, cattle ranching, logging, oil extraction and\nspills, mining, illegal coca farming, and colonization initiatives. Deforestation has shrunk\nterritories belonging to indigenous peoples and wiped out more than 90% of the population.\nMany are taking leading roles in sustainable tourism even as they introduce protected\nregions to more travelers.\nE\nEast Africa\nIn East Africa, significantly reducing such illegal hunting and allowing wildlife populations to\nrecover would allow the generation of significant economic benefits through trophy hunting\nand potentially ecotourism. “Illegal hunting is an extremely inefficient use of wildlife\nresources because it fails to capture the value of wildlife achievable through alternative\nforms of use such as trophy hunting and ecotourism,” said Peter Lindsey, author of the new\nstudy. Most residents believed that ecotourism could solve this circumstance. They have\npassion for local community empowerment, loves photography and writes to laud current\nlocal conservation efforts, create environmental awareness and promote ecotourism.\nF\nIndonesia\nIn Indonesia, ecotourism started to become an important concept from 1995, in order to\nstrengthen the domestic travelling movement, the local government targeting the right\nmarkets is a prerequisite for successful ecotourism. The market segment for Indonesian\necotourism consists of: (i) “The silent generation”, 55-64 year-old people who are wealthy\nenough, generally well-educated and have no dependent children, and can travel for four\nweeks; (ii) “The baby boom generation”, junior successful executives aged 35-54 years,\nwho are likely to be travelling with their family and children (spending 2-3 weeks on travel)\n– travelling for them is a stress reliever; and (iii) the “X generation”, aged 18-29 years, who\nlove to do ecotours as backpackers – they are generally students who can travel for 3-12\nmonths with monthly expenditure of US$300-500. It is suggested that the promotion of\nIndonesian ecotourism products should aim to reach these various cohorts of tourists. The\ncountry welcomes diverse levels of travelers.\nG\nOn the other hand, ecotourism provides as many services as traditional tourism. Nestled\nbetween Mexico, Guatemala and the Caribbean Sea is the country of Belize. It is the\nwonderful place for Hamanasi honeymoon, a bottle of champagne upon arrival, three\nmeals daily, private service on one night of your stay and a choice of adventures\ndepending on the length of your stay. It also offers six-night and seven-night honeymoon\n \n2\n\npackages. A variety of specially tailored tours, including the Brimstone Hill Fortress, and a\ntrip to a neighboring island. Guided tours include rainforest, volcano and off-road plantation\ntours.
