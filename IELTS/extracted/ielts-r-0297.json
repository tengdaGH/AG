  "passage_text": "Reading Practice\n \nMultitasks\nA\nDo you read while listening to music? Do you like to watch TV while finishing your\nhomework? People who have these kinds of habits are called multi-taskers.\nMultitasks are able to complete two tasks at the same time by dividing their focus.\nHowever, Thomas Lehman, a researcher in Psychology, believes people never really do\nmultiple things simultaneously. Maybe a person is reading while listening to music, but in\nreality, the brain can only focus on one task. Reading thewords in a book will cause you to\nignore some of the words of the music. When people think they are accomplishing two\ndifferent tasks efficiently, what they are really doing is dividing their focus. While listening to\nmusic, people become less able to focus on their surroundings. For example, we all have\nexperience of times when we talk with friends and they are not responding properly. Maybe\nthey are listening to someone else talk, or maybe they are reading a text on their smart\nphone and don't hear what you are saying. Lehman called this phenomenon “email voice\"\nB\nthe world has been changed by computers and its spin offs like smart-phones or\ncellphones. Now that most individuals have a personal device, like a smart-phoneor a\nlaptop, they are frequently reading, watching or listening to virtual information. This raises\nthe occurrence of multitasking in our day to day life. Nowwhen you work, you work with\nyour typewriter, your cellphone, and some colleagues who may drop by at any time to\nspeak with you. In professional meetings, when one normally focuses and listens to one\nanother, people are more likely to have a cell phone in their lap, reading or communicating\nsilently with more people than ever, liven inventions such as the cordless phone has\nincreased multitasking. In the old days, a traditional wall phone would ring, and then the\nhousewife would have to stop her activities to answer it. When it rang, the housewife will sit\ndown with her legs up. and chat, with no laundry or sweeping or answering the door. In the\nmodern era, our technology is convenient enough to not interrupt our daily tasks.\nC\nEarl Miller, an expert at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, studied the prefrontal\ncortex, which controls the brain while a person is multitasking. According to his studies, the\nsize of this cortex varies between species, He found that for humans, the size of this part\nconstitutes one third of the brain, while it is only 4 to 5 percent in dogs, and about 15% in\nmonkeys. Given that this cortex is larger on a human, it allows a human to be more flexible\nand accurate in his or her multitasking.. However, Miller wanted to look further into whether\nthe cortexwas truly processing information about two different tasks simultaneously. He\ndesigned an experiment where he presents visual stimulants to his subjects in a wax that\nmimics multi-tasking. Miller then attached sensors tothe patients \" heads to pick up the\nelectric patterns of the brain. This sensor would show if\" the brain particles, called neurons,\nwere truly processing two different tasks. What he found is that the brain neurons only lit up\nin singular areas one at a time, and never simultaneously.\nD\nDavis Meyer, a professor of University of Michigan, studied the young adults in a similar\n \n1\n\nexperiment. He instructed them to simultaneously do math problems and classify simple\nwords into different categories. For this experiment. Meyer found that when you think you\nare doing several jobs at the same time, you are actuallyswitching between jobs. Even\nthough the people tried to do the tasks at the sametime, and both tasks were eventually\naccomplished, overall, the task look more time than if the person focused on a single task\none at a time.\nE\nPeople sacrifice efficiency when multitasking, Gloria Mark set office workers as his\nsubjects. He found that they were constantly multitasking. He observed that nearly every\n11 minutes people at work were disrupted. He found that doing different jobs at the same\ntime may actually save time. However, despite the fact that they are faster, it does not\nmean they are more efficient. And we are equally likely to self-interrupt as be interrupted by\noutside sources. He found that in office nearly every 12 minutes an employee would stop\nand with no reason at all,cheek a website on their computer, call someone or write an\nemail. If they concentrated for more than 20 minutes, they would feel distressed. He\nsuggestedthat the average person may suffer from a short concentration span. This short\nattention span might be natural, but others suggest that new technology may be the\nproblem. With cellphones and computers at our sides at all times, people will never run out\nof distractions. The format of media, such as advertisements, music, news articles and TV\nshows are also shortening, so people are used to paying attention to information for a very\nshort time\nF\nSo even though focusing on one single task is the most efficient way for our brainsto work,\nit is not practical to use this method in real life. According to human nature, people feel\nmore comfortable and efficient in environments with a varietyof tasks, Edward Hallowell\nsaid that people are losing a lot of efficiency in the workplace due to multitasking, outside\ndistractions and self-distractions. As it matter of fact, the changes made to the workplace\ndo not have to be dramatic.\nNo one is suggesting we ban e-mail or make employees focus on only one task. However,\ncertain common workplace tasks, such as group meetings, would be more efficient if we\nbanned cell-phones, a common distraction. A person can alsoapply these tips to prevent\nself-distraction. Instead of arriving to your office and checking all of your e-mails for new\ntasks, a common workplace ritual, a person could dedicate an hour to a single task first\nthing in the morning. Self-timing is a great way to reduce distraction and efficiently finish\ntasks one by one, instead of slowing ourselves down with multi-tasking.\n \n2",
