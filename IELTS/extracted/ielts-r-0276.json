  "passage_text": "Reading Practice\n \nMaori Fish Hooks\nA. Maori fish hooks, made from wood, bone, stone and flax, are intended to have the best\npossible design and function. The hooks are designed to target specific species with\nprecision. In the industry of commercial long-line fishing, there are some Maori hook\ndesigns which are making a splash.\nB. When Polynesians first came New Zealand sometime within the years 1100-1300 AD,\nthey didn’t have the technology necessary to heat and manipulate metal out of rocks.\nMeanwhile, fish was the settlers’ main food source at the time, so fishermen made their\nhooks and fishing gear out of wood, bone, stone and shells. Other plants native to the\nisland of New Zealand, like as flax (harakeke), cabbage tree (ti) and astelia (kiekie) gave\nthe necessary fibrous material to make fishing lines and nets of greater or equal strength to\nthe jute, which was being used by the Europeans at the time. However, as a material,\nmetal is more malleable, and can be changed into any shape, while natural materials are\nlimited in the shapes they can take on. The Maori fish hooks needed to be more innovative\nin the ways that they dealt with these limitations.\nC. Early accounts of Europeans who settled and explored New Zealand claimed that Maori\nhooks, known as matau, were “odd”, “of doubtful efficacy”, “very clumsy affairs” or\n“impossible looking.” Archaeologists from more recent times have also mentioned the\nround hook appearing as odd, with comments such as, “shaped in a manner which makes\nit very difficult to imagine could ever be effective in catching a fish.” William Anderson, who\nwas aboard the Resolution during Cook’s third voyage in 1777 as the ship’s surgeon,\ncommented that the Maori “live chiefly by fishing, making use…of wooden fish hooks\npointed with bone, but so oddly made that a stranger is at a loss to know how they can\nanswer such a purpose.”\nD. The Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa did their own recent study on Maori\nfish hooks two hundred and thirty years later, and were able to demonstrate that the unique\nhook design was a matter of function. The hook’s design allowed it to catch fish by spinning\naway from the direction of the point and catching their jaws, instead of poking a hole\nthrough the fish or by being used as a lever, which some archaeologists also suggested. It\nseems that the design of the Maori fish hook is, perhaps, the world’s most efficiently and\nmasterfully designed fish hook, likely superior to any modern metal fish hook of today.\nE. To make larger hooks, Maori used shanks made of strong wood, with stout points made\nof bone or shell. They tied tree branches and saplings together to grow them into the ideal\nshapes for building, then harvested the plants when they grew to the appropriate size. They\nhardened wood by carefully drying it and burying underground with fires lit above it. Human\nbone was often used for bone points, which they lashed securely to a groove at the end of\nthe shank with pre-made flax materials (muka). When they wanted to catch larger species\nlike sharks, groper and ling, they used composite hook. However, average the traditional\nhook was usually not longer than a three finger breadth (128 mm length).\nF. To capture seabirds for food and feathers, like albatross, the islanders used slender\nhooks which can be differentiated from other hooks intended to catch fish by their lighter\nbuild and lack of an inturned point. Many of these hooks were collected by early explorers,\nsuggesting that the taking of seabirds with hook and line was an important source of food\nand feathers for Maori. (105 mm length). Slender hooks with wide gapes were used to\n \n1\n\ncapture albatross and other seabirds for food and feathers, and can be distinguished from\nhooks intended to catch fish by the lighter construction and lack of an inturned point. Early\nexplorers collected many of these hooks which could indicated that catching seabirds with\na hook and line provided significant amounts of food and feathers for the Maori. (105 mm\nlength)\nG. Maori adopted new materials quickly once they became available with European\nexplorers, sealers and whalers who began to arrive towards the end of the 1700s. At this\npoint, the Maori were still making their fish hooks, but now using metals and imported\nmaterials. Wooden and flax parts of old, abandoned fish hooks decomposed quickly as\ntraditional hooks were cast away in favor of new ones. Tools made of luxury materials such\nas ivory or greenstone may have been kept around as decorations items, with stylized\nMaori fish hooks seen today as a symbol of cultural revitalization.\n \nH. The Maori kept recreating traditional designs even as new materials poured in,\npreferring hook shapes which were introduced by Pakeha into the 1800s. By following the\ntradition of the rotating hook design, they remained connected with a part of their traditional\nculture. In the end, though, it was only a matter of time before the amount of mass-\nproduced metal European hooks finally overwhelmed the area, highlighting the difficulty of\nmaking hooks from nails, horseshoes and other metal objects, and finally the use of the\ntraditional designs fell out of favor.\nI. By the end of the 19th and beginning of the 20th century, tourists and collectors’\ndemands for Maori artifacts had grown, leading manufacturers to produce large quantities\nof forged hooks. These replicas were then traded with both Maoris and Europeans to use\nas forgeries of the real thing, sometimes directly commissioned by artifact dealers\nthemselves. Fake hooks can be spotted by their cheap construction, inconsistent materials,\nrudimentary lashings, odd or over-elaborate decorative carvings, and finally, by the lack of\nin-turned points or angled grooves used to actually attach the fishing line.\nJ. The ways that matau have changed throughout their history is somewhat symbolic of\nhow Maori have adapted to use European tools, materials and technology to their purposes\nover time, as well as the ways that European influence and technology contributed to,\nrather overtook, generally compatible Maori skills, and traditional materials were replaced\nor complemented by metals and, more recently, artificial materials. Commercial longline\nfishermen everywhere have begun using the circle hook design today, one that is nearly\nthe same as the traditional matau in both its appearance and functionality.
