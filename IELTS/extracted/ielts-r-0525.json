  "passage_text": "Reading Practice\n \nThe new way to be a fifth-grader\nI peer over his shoulder at his laptop screen to see the math problem the fifth-grader is\npondering. It's a trigonometry problem. Carpenter, a serious-feced ten-year-old, pauses for\na second, fidgets, then clicks on ”0 degrees.\" The computer tells him that he's correct. \"It\ntook a while for me to work it out,\" he admits sheepishly. The software then generates\nanother problem, followed by another, until eventually he's done ten in a row.\nLast November, his teacher, Kami Thordarson, began using Khan Academy in her class. It\nis an educational website on which students can watch some 2,400 videos. The videos are\nanything but sophisticated. At seven to 14 minutes long, they consist of a voiceover by the\nsite's founder, Salman Khan, chattily describing a mathematical concept or explaining how\nto solve a problem, while his hand-scribbled formulas and diagrams appear on-screen. As\na student, you can review a video as many times as you want, scrolling back several times\nover puzzling parts and fast-forwarding through the boring bits you already know. Once\nyou've mastered a video, you can move on to the next one.\nInitially, Thordarson thought Khan Academy would merely be a helpful supplement to her\nnormal instruction. But it quickly became far more than that. She is now on her way to\n\"flipping\" the way her class works. This involves replacing some of her lectures with Khan's\nvideos, which students can watch at home. Then in class, they focus on working on the\nproblem areas together. The idea is to invert the normal rhythms of school, so that lectures\nare viewed in the children's own time and homework is done at school. It sounds weird,\nThordarson admits, but this reversal makes sense when you think about it. It is when they\nare doing homework that students are really grappling with a subject and are most likely to\nwant someone to talk to. And Khan Academy provides teachers with a dashboard\napplication that lets them see the instant a student gets stuck.\nFor years, teachers like Thordarson have complained about the frustrations of teaching to\nthe \"middle\" of the class. They stand at the whiteboard trying to get 25 or more students to\nlearn at the same pace. Advanced students get bored and tune out, lagging ones get lost\nand tune out, and pretty soon half the class is not paying attention. Since the rise of\npersonal computers in the 1980s, educators have hoped that technology could save the\nday by offering lessons tailored to each child. Schools have spent millions of dollars on\nsophisticated classroom technology, but the effort has been in vain. The one-to-one\ninstruction it requires is, after all, prohibitively expensive. What country can afford such a\nluxury?\nKhan never intended to overhaul the school curricula and he doesn't have a consistent,\ncomprehensive plan for doing so. Nevertheless, some of his fans believe that he has\nstumbled onto the solution to education's middle-of-the-class mediocrity. Most notable\namong them is Bill Gates, whose foundation has invested $1.5 million in Khan's site.\nStudents have pointed out that Khan is particularly good at explaining all the hidden, small\nsteps in math problems—steps that teachers often gloss over. He has an uncanny ability to\ninhabit the mind of someone who doesn't already understand something.\nHowever, not all educators are enamoured with Khan and his site. Gary Stager, a longtime\neducational consultant and advocate of laptops in classrooms,, thinks Khan Academy is not\ninnovative at all. The videos and software modules, he contends, are just a high-tech\nversion of the outdated teaching techniques—lecturing and drilling. Schools have become\n \n1\n\n\"joyless test-prep factories,\" he says, and Khan Academy caters to this dismal trend.\nAs Sylvia Martinez, president of an organization focusing on technology in the classroom,\nputs it, \"The things they're doing are really just rote.\" Flipping the classroom isn't an entirely\nnew idea, Martinez says, and she doubts that it would work for the majority of pupils: \"I'm\nsorry, but if they can't understand the lecture in a classroom, they're not going to grasp it\nbetter when it's done through a video at home.\"\nAnother limitation of Khan's site is that the drilling software can only handle questions\nwhere the answers are unambiguously right or wrong, like math or chemistry; Khan has\nrelatively few videos on messier, grey-area subjects like history. Khan and Gates admit\nthere is no easy way to automate the teaching of writing—even though it is just as critical\nas math.\nEven if Khan is truly liberating students to advance at their own pace, it is not clear that\nschools will be able to cope. The very concept of grade levels implies groups of students\nmoving along together at an even pace. So what happens when, using Khan Academy, you\nwind up with a ten-year- old who has already mastered high-school physics? Khan's\nprogrammer, Ben Kamens, has heard from teachers who have seen Khan Academy\npresentations and loved the idea but wondered whether they could modify it \"to stop\nstudents from becoming this advanced.\"\nKhan's success has injected him into the heated wars over school reform. Reformers\ntoday, by and large, believe student success should be carefully tested, with teachers and\nprincipals receiving better pay if their students advance more quickly. In essence, Khan\ndoesn't want to change the way institutions teach; he wants to change how people learn,\nwhether they're in a private school or a public school—or for that matter, whether they're a\nstudent or an adult trying to self-educate in Ohio, Brazil, Russia, or India. One member of\nKhan's staff is spearheading a drive to translate the videos into ten major languages. It's\nclassic start-up logic: do something novel, do it with speed, and the people who love it will\nfind you. \nAdapted from Wired Magazine\n \n2",
