  "passage_text": "Reading Practice\n \nCrisis! freshwater\nA . As in New Delhi and Phoenix, policymakers worldwide wield great power over how\nwater resources and managed. Wise use of such power will become increasingly important\nas the years go by because the world’s demand for freshwater is currently overtaking its\nready supply in many places, and this situation shows no sign of abating.\nB . That the problem is well-known makes it no less disturbing: today one out of six people,\nmore than a billion, suffer inadequate access to safe freshwater. By 2025, according to\ndata released by the United Nations, the freshwater resources of more than half the\ncountries across the globe will undergo either stress- for example, when people\nincreasingly demand more water than is available or safe for use-or outright shortages. By\nmid-century, as much as three-quarters of the earth’s population could face scarcities of\nfreshwater. \nC . Scientists expect water scarcity to become more common in large part because the\nworld’s population is rising and many people are getting richer (thus expanding demand)\nand because global climate change is exacerbating aridity and reducing supply in many\nregions. What is more, many water sources are threatened by faulty waste disposal,\nreleases of industrial pollutants, fertilizer runoff, and coastal influxes of saltwater into\naquifers as groundwater is depleted.\nD . Because lack of access to water can lead to starvation, disease, political instability, and\neven armed conflict, failure to take action can have broad and grave consequences.\nFortunately, to a great extent, the technologies and policy tools required to conserve\nexisting freshwater and to secure more of it are known among which several seem\nparticularly effective. What is needed now is action. Governments and authorities at every\nlevel have to formulate and execute plans for implementing the political, economic, and\ntechnological measures that can ensure water security now and in the coming decades.\nE . The world’s water problems require, as a start, an understanding of how much\nfreshwater each person requires, along with knowledge of the factors that impede supply\nand increase demand in different parts of the world. Main Falkenmark of the Stockholm\nInternational Water Institute and other experts estimate that, on average, each person on\nthe earth needs a minimum of 1000 cubic meters (m3) of water. The minimum water each\nperson requires for drinking, hygiene, and growing food. The volume is equivalent to two-\nfifths of an Olympic-size swimming pool. \nF . Much of the Americas and northern Eurasia enjoy abundant water supplies. But several\nregions are beset by greater or lesser degrees of “physical” scarcity-whereby demand\nexceeds local availability. Other areas, among them Central Africa, parts of the Indian\nsubcontinent, and Southeast Asia contend with “economic” water scarcity limit access even\nthough sufficient supplies are available.\nG. More than half of the precipitation that falls on land is never available for capture or\nstorage because it evaporates from the ground or transpires from plants; this fraction is\ncalled blue-water sources-rivers, lakes, wetlands, and aquifers-that people can tap directly.\nFarm irrigation from these free-flowing bodies is the biggest single human use of\nfreshwater resources, but the intense local demand they create often drains the\nsurroundings of ready supplies.\n \n1\n\n \nH . Lots of water, but not always where it is needed one hundred and ten thousand cubic\nkilometers of precipitation, nearly 10 times the volume of Lake Superior, falls from the sky\nonto the earth’s land surface every year. This huge quantity would easily fulfill the\nrequirements of everyone on the planet if the water arrived where and when people needed\nit. But much of it cannot be captured (top), and the rest is disturbed unevenly (bottom).\nGreen water (61.1% of total precipitation): absorbed by soil and plants, then released back\ninto the air: unavailable for withdrawal. Bluewater (38.8% of total precipitation): collected in\nrivers, lakes, wetlands, and groundwater: available for withdrawal before it evaporates or\nreaches the ocean. These figures may not add up to 100% because of rounding. Only\n1.5% is directly used by people.\nI . Waters run away in tremendous wildfires in recent years.
