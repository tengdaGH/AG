  "passage_text": "Reading Practice\n \nThe Search for Extra-terrestrial Intelligence\n \nThe question of whether we are alone in the Universe has haunted humanity for\ncenturies, but we may now stand poised on the brink of the answer to that question, as we\nsearch for radio signals from other intelligent civilisations. This search, often known by the\nacronym SETI (search for extra-terrestrial intelligence], is a difficult one. Although groups\naround the world have been searching intermittently for three decades, it is only now that\nwe have reached the level of technology where we can make a determined attempt to\nsearch all nearby stars for any sign of life.\nA\nThe primary reason for the search is basic curiosity - the same curiosity about the natural\nworld that drives all pure science. We want to know whether we are alone in the\nUniverse. We want to know whether life evolves naturally if given the right conditions, or\nwhether there is something very special about the Earth to have fostered the variety of life\nforms that we see around us on the planet. The simple detection of a radio signal will be\nsufficient to answer this most basic of all questions. In this sense, SETI is another cog in\nthe machinery of pure science which is continually pushing out the horizon of our\nknowledge. However, there are other reasons for being interested in whether life exists\nelsewhere. For example, we have had civilisation on Earth for perhaps only a few thousand\nyears, and the threats of nuclear war and pollution over the last few decades have told us\nthat our survival may be tenuous. Will we last another two thousand years or will we wipe\nourselves out? Since the lifetime of a planet like ours is several billion years, we can expect\nthat, if other civilisations do survive in our galaxy, their ages will range from zero to several\nbillion years. Thus any other civilisation that we hear from is likely to be far older, on\naverage, than ourselves. The mere existence of such a civilisation will tell us that long-term\nsurvival is possible, and gives us some cause for optimism. It is even possible that the\nolder civilisation may pass on the benefits of their experience in dealing with threats to\nsurvival such as nuclear war and global pollution, and other threats that we haven’t yet\ndiscovered.\nB\nIn discussing whether we are alone, most SETI scientists adopt two ground rules. First,\nUFQs (Unidentified Flying Objects) are generally ignored since most scientists\ndon’t consider the evidence for them to be strong enough to bear serious\nconsideration (although it is also important to keep an open mind in case any really\nconvincing evidence emerges in the future). Second, we make a very conservative\nassumption that we are looking for a life form that is pretty well like us, since if it differs\nradically from us we may well not recognise it as a life form, quite apart from whether we\nare able to communicate with it. In other words, the life form we are looking for may well\nhave two green heads and seven fingers, but it will nevertheless resemble us in that it\nshould communicate with its fellows, be interested in the Universe, live on a planet orbiting\na star like our Sun, and perhaps most restrictively, have a chemistry, like us, based on\ncarbon and water.\nC\n \n1\n\nEven when we make these assumptions, our understanding of other life forms is still\nseverely limited. We do not even know, for example, how many stars have planets, and\nwe certainly do not know how likely it is that life will arise naturally, given the right\nconditions. However, when we look at the 100 billion stars in our galaxy (the Milky Way),\nand 100 billion galaxies in the observable Universe, it seems inconceivable that at least\none of these planets does not have a life form on it; in fact, the best educated guess we\ncan make, using the little that we do know about the conditions for carbon-based life, leads\nus to estimate that perhaps one in 100,000 stars might have a life-bearing planet orbiting it.\nThat means that our nearest neighbours are perhaps 100 light years away, which is almost\nnext door in astronomical terms.\nD\nAn alien civilisation could choose many different ways of sending information across the\ngalaxy, but many of these either require too much energy, or else are severely\nattenuated while traversing the vast distances across the galaxy. It turns out that, for a\ngiven amount of transmitted power, radio waves in the frequency range 1000 to 3000 MHz\ntravel the greatest distance, and so all searches to date have concentrated on looking for\nradio waves in this frequency range. So far there have been a number of searches by\nvarious groups around the world, including Australian searches using the radio telescope at\nParkes, New South Wales. Until now there have not been any detections from the few\nhundred stars which have been searched. The scale of the searches has been increased\ndramatically since 1992, when the US Congress voted NASA $10 million per year for ten\nyears to conduct a thorough search for extra-terrestrial life. Much of the money in this\nproject is being spent on developing the special hardware needed to search many\nfrequencies at once. The project has two parts. One part is a targeted search using the\nworld’s largest radio telescopes, the American-operated telescope in Arecibo, Puerto Rico\nand the French telescope in Nancy in France. This part of the project is searching the\nnearest 1000 likely stars with high sensitivity for signals in the frequency range 1000 to\n3000 MHz. The other part of the project is an undirected search which is monitoring all of\nspace with a lower sensitivity, using the smaller antennas of NASA’s Deep Space Network.\nE\nThere is considerable debate over how we should react if we detect a signal from an alien\ncivilisation. Everybody agrees that we should not reply immediately. Quite apart from\nthe impracticality of sending a reply over such large distances at short notice, it raises a\nhost of ethical questions that would have to be addressed by the global community before\nany reply could be sent. Would the human race face the culture shock if faced with a\nsuperior and much older civilisation? Luckily, there is no urgency about this. The stars\nbeing searched are hundreds of light years away, so it takes hundreds of years for their\nsignal to reach us, and a further few hundred years for our reply to reach them. It’s not\nimportant, then, if there’s a delay of a few years, or decades, while the human race debates\nthe question of whether to reply, and perhaps carefully drafts a reply.\n \n2",
