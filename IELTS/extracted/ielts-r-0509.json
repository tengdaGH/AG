  "passage_text": "Reading Practice\n \nThe life of the European bee-eater\nA brilliant movement of colour as it catches its food in the air, the European bee-eater\nmoves between three continents.\nTrue to their name, bee-eaters eat bees (though their diet includes just about any flying\ninsect). When the bird catches a bee, it returns to its tree to get rid of the bees poison,\nwhich it does very efficiently. It hits the insect's head on one side of the branch, then rubs\nits body on the other. The rubbing makes its prey harmless.\nEuropean bee-eaters (Merops apiaster) form families that breed in the spring and summer\nacross an area that extends from Spain to Kazakhstan. Farmland and river valleys provide\nhuge numbers of insects. Flocks of bee-eaters follow tractors as they work fields. When the\nbirds come upon a beehive, they eat well - a researcher once found a hundred bees in the\nstomach of a bee-eater near a hive.\nEuropean bees pass the winter by sleeping in their hives, which cuts off the bee-eater's\nmain source of food. So, in late summer, bee-eaters begin a long, dangerous journey.\nMassive flocks from Spain, France and northern Italy cross the Sahara desert to their\nwintering grounds in West Africa. Bee-eaters from Hungary and other parts of Central and\nEastern Europe cross the Mediterranean Sea and Arabian Desert to winter in southern\nAfrica. 'It's an extremely risky stratagem, this migration,' says C. Hilary Fry, a\nBritish ornithologist who has studied European bee-eaters for more than 45 years.\n'At least 30 percent of the birds will be killed by predators before they make it back to\nEurope the following spring.'\nIn April, they return to Europe. Birds build nests by digging tunnels in riverbanks. They work\nfor up to 20 days. By the end of the job, they've moved 15 to 26 pounds of soil - more than\n80 times their weight.\nThe nesting season is a time when families help each other, and sons or uncles help feed\ntheir father's or brother's chicks as soon as they come out of their eggs. The helpers\nbenefit, too: parents with helpers can provide more food for chicks to continue the family\nline.\nIt's a short, spectacular life. European bee-eaters live for five to six years. The difficulties of\nmigration and avoiding predators along the way affect every bird. Bee-eaters today also\nfind it harder to find food, as there are fewer insects around as a result of pesticides.\nBreeding sites are also disappearing, as rivers are turned into concrete-walled canals.\n \n1",
