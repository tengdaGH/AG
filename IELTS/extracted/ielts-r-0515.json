  "passage_text": "Reading Practice\n \nThe MIT factor: celebrating 150 years of maverick\ngenius\nThe Massachusetts Institute of Technology has led the world into the future for 150 years\nwith scientific innovations.\nThe musician Yo-Yo Ma’s cello may not be the obvious starting point for a journey into one\nof the world’s great universities. But, as you quickly realise when you step inside the\nMassachusetts Institute of Technology, there’s precious little going on that you would\nnormally see on a university campus. The cello, resting in a corner of MIT’s celebrated\nmedia laboratory — a hub of creativity — looks like any other electric classical instrument.\nBut it is much more. Machover, the composer, teacher and inventor responsible for its\ncreation, calls it a ‘hyperinstrument’, a sort of thinking machine that allows Ma and his cello\nto interact with one another and make music together. ‘The aim is to build an instrument\nworthy of a great musician like Yo-Yo Ma that can understand what he is trying to do and\nrespond to it,’ Machover says. The cello has numerous sensors across its body and by\nmeasuring the pressure, speed and angle of the virtuoso’s performance it can interpret his\nmood and engage with it, producing extraordinary new sounds. The virtuoso cellist\nfrequently performs on the instrument as he tours around the world. \nMachover’s passion for pushing at the boundaries of the existing world to extend and\nunleash human potential is not a bad description of MIT as a whole. This unusual\ncommunity brings highly gifted, highly motivated individuals together from a vast range of\ndisciplines, united by a common desire: to leap into the dark and reach for the unknown.\nThe result of that single unifying ambition is visible all around. For the past 150 years, MIT\nhas been leading the world into the future. The discoveries of its teachers and students\nhave become the common everyday objects that we now all take for granted. The\ntelephone, electromagnets, radars, high-speed photography, office photocopiers, cancer\ntreatments, pocket calculators, computers, the Internet, the decoding of the human\ngenome, lasers, space travel ... the list of innovations that involved essential contributions\nfrom MIT and its faculty goes on and on.\nFrom the moment MIT was founded by William Barton Rogers in 1861, it was clear what it\nwas not. While Harvard stuck to the English model of a classical education, with its\nemphasis on Latin and Greek, MIT looked to the German system of learning based on\nresearch and hands-on experimentation. Knowledge was at a premium, but it had to be\nuseful.\nThis down-to-earth quality is enshrined in the school motto, Mens et manus - Mind and\nhand - as well as its logo, which shows a gowned scholar standing beside an ironmonger\nbearing a hammer and anvil. That symbiosis of intellect and craftsmanship still suffuses the\ninstitute’s classrooms, where students are not so much taught as engaged and inspired.\nTake Christopher Merrill, 21, a third-year undergraduate in computer science. He is\nspending most of his time on a competition set in his robotics class. The contest is to see\nwhich student can most effectively program a robot to build a house out of blocks in under\nten minutes. Merrill says he could have gone for the easiest route - designing a simple\nrobot that would build the house quickly. But he wanted to try to master an area of robotics\n \n1\n\n \nthat remains unconquered — adaptability, the ability of the robot to rethink its plans as the\nenvironment around it changes, as would a human.\n‘I like to take on things that have never been done before rather than to work in an iterative\nway just making small steps forward,’ he explains.\nMerrill is already planning the start-up he wants to set up when he graduates in a year’s\ntime. He has an idea for an original version of a contact lens that would augment reality by\nallowing consumers to see additional visual information. He is fearful that he might be just\ntoo late in taking his concept to market, as he has heard that a Silicon Valley firm is already\ndeveloping something similar. As such, he might become one of many MIT graduates who\ngo on to form companies that fail. Alternatively, he might become one of those who go on\nto succeed in spectacular fashion. And there are many of them. A survey of living MIT\nalumni* found that they have formed 25,800 companies, employing more than three million\npeople, including about a quarter of the workforce of Silicon Valley. What MIT delights in is\ntaking brilliant minds from around the world in vastly diverse disciplines and putting them\ntogether. You can see that in its sparkling new David Koch Institute for Integrative Cancer\nResearch, which brings scientists, engineers and clinicians under one roof.\nOr in its Energy Initiative, which acts as a bridge for MIT’s combined work across all its five\nschools, channelling huge resources into the search for a solution to global warming. It\nworks to improve the efficiency of existing energy sources, including nuclear power. It is\nalso forging ahead with alternative energies from solar to wind and geothermal, and has\nrecently developed the use of viruses to synthesise batteries that could prove crucial in the\nadvancement of electric cars.\nIn the words of Tim Berners-Lee, the Briton who invented the World Wide Web, ‘It’s not just\nanother university.\nEven though I spend my time with my head buried in the details of web technology, the\nnice thing is that when I do walk the corridors, I bump into people who are working in other\nfields with their students that are fascinating, and that keeps me intellectually alive.’\nadapted from the Guardian\n \n \n* people who have left a university or college after completing their studies there\n \n2",
