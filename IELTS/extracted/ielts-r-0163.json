The private car is assumed to have widened our horizons and increased our mobility.\nWhen we consider our children’s mobility, they can be driven to more places (and more\ndistant places) than they could visit without access to a motor vehicle. However, allowing\nour cities to be dominated by cars has progressively eroded children’s independent\nmobility. Children have lost much of their freedom to explore their own neighborhood or city\nwithout adult supervision. In recent surveys, when parents in some cities were asked about\ntheir own childhood experiences, the majority remembered having more, or far more,\nopportunities for going out on their own, compared with their own children today. They had\nmore freedom to explore their own environment.\n2.    Children’s independent access to their local streets may be important for their own\npersonal, mental and psychological development. Allowing them to get to know their own\nneighborhood and community gives them a \"sense of place”. This depends on \"active\nexploration”, which is not provided for when children are passengers in cars. (Such children\nmay see more, but they learn less.) Not only is it important that children be able to get to\nlocal play areas by themselves, but walking and cycling journeys to school and to other\ndestinations provide genuine play activities in themselves.\n3.    They are very significant time and money costs for parents associated with\ntransporting their children to school, sport and other locations. Research in the United\nKingdom estimated that this cost, in 1990, was between 10 billion and 20 million pounds.\n(AIPPG)\n4.    The reduction in children’s freedom may also contribute to a weakening of the sense of\nlocal community. As fewer children and adults use the streets as pedestrians, these streets\nbecome less sociable places. There is less opportunity for children and adults to have the\nspontaneous of community. This in itself may exacerbate fears associated with assault and\nmolestation of children, because there are fewer adults available who know their neighbors’\nchildren, and who can look out for their safety.\n5.    The extra traffic involved in transporting children results in increased traffic congestion,\npollution and accident risk. As our roads become more dangerous, more parents drive their\nchildren to more places, thus contributing to increased levels of danger for the remaining\npedestrians. Anyone who has experienced either the reduced volume of traffic in peak hour\nduring school holidays, or the traffic jams near schools at the end of a school day, will not\nneed convincing about these points. Thus, there are also important environmental\nimplications of children’s loss of freedom.\n6.    As individuals, parents strive to provide the best upbringing they can for their\nchildren. However, in doing so, (e.g. by driving their children to sport, school or recreation)\nparents may be contributing to a more dangerous environment for children generally. The\nidea that “streets are for cars and back yards and playgrounds are for children” is a strongly\nheld belief, and parents have little choice as individuals but to keep their children off the\nstreets if they want to protect their safety.\n7.    In many parts of Dutch cities, and some traffic calmed precincts in Germany,\nresidential streets are now places where cars must give way to pedestrians. In these areas,\nresidents are accepting the view that the function of streets is not solely to provide mobility\n \n1\n\nfor cars. Streets may also be for social interaction, walking, cycling and playing. One of the\nmost important aspects of these European streets, in terms of giving cities back to children,\nhas been a range of “traffic calming” initiatives, aimed at reducing the volume and speed of\ntraffic. These initiatives have had complex interactive effects, leading to a sense that\nchildren have been able to do this in safety. Recent research has demonstrated that\nchildren in many German cities have significantly higher levels of freedom to travel to\nplaces in their own neighborhood or city than children in other cities in the world.\n8.    Modifying cities in order to enhance children’s freedom will not only benefit children.\nSuch cities will become more environmentally sustainable, as well as more sociable and\nmore livable for all city residents. Perhaps, it will be our concern for our children’s welfare\nthat convinces us that we need to challenge the dominance of the car in our cities.\n \n2",
