  "passage_text": "Reading Practice\n \nThe Beginning of Football\nA\n \nFootball as we now know it developed in Britain in the 19th century, but the game is far\nolder than this. In fact, the term has historically been applied to games played on foot, as\nopposed to those played on horseback, so ‘football’ hasn’t always involved kicking a ball. It\nhas generally been played by men, though at the end of the 17th century, games were\nplayed between married and single women in a town in Scotland. The married women\nregularly won.\nB\nThe very earliest form of football for which we have evidence is the ‘tsu’chu’, which was\nplayed in China and may date back 3,000 years. It was performed in front of the Emperor\nduring festivities to mark his birthday. It involved kicking a leather ball through a 30-40 cm\nopening into a small net fixed onto long bamboo canes – a feat that demanded great skill\nand excellent technique.\nC\nAnother form of the game, also originating from the Far East, was the Japanese ‘kemari’\nwhich dates from about the fifth century and is still played today. This is a type of circular\nfootball game, a more dignified and ceremonious experience requiring certain skills, but not\ncompetitive in the way the Chinese game was, nor is there the slightest sign of struggle for\npossession of the ball. The players had to pass the ball to each other, in a relatively small\nspace, trying not to let it touch the ground.\nD\nThe Romans had a much livelier game, ‘harpastum’. Each team member had his own\nspecific tactical assignment took a noisy interest in the proceedings and the score. The role\nof the feet was so small as scarcely to be of consequence. The game remained popular for\n700 or 800 years, but, although it was taken to England, it is doubtful whether it can be\nconsidered as a forerunner of contemporary football.\nE\nThe game that flourished in Britain from the 8th to the 19th centuries was substantially\ndifferent from all the previously known forms – more disorganised, more violent, more\nspontaneous and usually played by an indefinite number of players. Frequently, the games\ntook the form of a heated contest between whole villages. Kicking opponents were allowed,\nas in fact was almost everything else.\nF\nThere was tremendous enthusiasm for football, even though the authorities repeatedly\nintervened to restrict it, as a public nuisance. In the 14th and 15th centuries, England,\nScotland and France all made football punishable by law, because of the disorder that\ncommonly accompanied it, or because the well-loved recreation prevented subjects from\npracticing more useful military disciplines. None of these efforts had much effect.\n \n1\n\nG\nThe English passion for football was particularly strong in the 16th century, influenced by\nthe popularity of the rather better organised Italian game of ‘calcio’. English football was as\nrough as ever, but it found a prominent supporter in the school headmaster Richard\nMulcaster. He pointed out that it had positive educational value and promoted health and\nstrength. Mulcaster claimed that all that was needed was to refine it a little, limit the number\nof participants in each team and, more importantly, have a referee to oversee the game.\nH\nThe game persisted in a disorganised form until the early 19th century, when a number of\ninfluential English schools developed their own adaptations. In some, including Rugby\nSchool, the ball could be touched with the hands or carried; opponents could be tripped up\nand even kicked. It was recognised in educational circles that, as a team game, football\nhelped to develop such fine qualities as loyalty, selflessness, cooperation, subordination\nand deference to the team spirit. A ‘games cult’ developed in schools and some form of\nfootball became an obligatory part of the curriculum.\nI\nIn 1863, developments reached a climax. At Cambridge University, an initiative began to\nestablish some uniform standards and rules that would be accepted by everyone, but there\nwere essentially two camps: the minority – Rugby School and some others – wished to\ncontinue with their own form of the game, in particular allowing players to carry the ball. In\nOctober of the same year, eleven London clubs and schools sent representatives to\nestablish a set of fundamental rules to govern the matches played amongst them. This\nmeeting marked the birth of the Football Association.\nJ\nThe dispute concerning kicking and tripping opponents and carrying the ball was discussed\nthoroughly at this and subsequent meetings, until eventually, on 8 December, the die-hard\nexponents of the Rugby style withdrew, marking a final split between rugby and football.\nWithin eight years, the Football Association already had 50 member clubs, and the first\nfootball competition in the world was started – the FA Cup.\n \n2",
