  "passage_text": "Reading Practice\n \nIn Praise of Amateurs\nDespite the specialization of scientific research, amateurs still have an important role to\nplay.\nDuring the scientific revolution of the 17th century, scientists were largely men of private\nmeans who pursued their interest in natural philosophy for their own edification. Only in the\npast century or two has it become possible to make a living from investigating the workings\nof nature. Modern science was, in other words, built on the work of amateurs. Today,\nscience is an increasingly specialized and compartmentalized subject, the domain of\nexperts who know more and more about less and less. Perhaps surprisingly, however,\namateurs – even those without private means – are still important.\nA recent poll carried out at a meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of\nScience by astronomer Dr Richard Fienberg found that, in addition to his field of\nastronomy, amateurs are actively involved in such field as acoustics, horticulture,\nornithology, meteorology, hydrology and palaeontology. Far from being crackpots, amateur\nscientists are often in close touch with professionals, some of whom rely heavily on their\nco-operation.\nAdmittedly, some fields are more open to amateurs than others. Anything that requires\nexpensive equipment is clearly a no-go area. And some kinds of research can be\ndangerous; most amateur chemists, jokes Dr Fienberg, are either locked up or have blown\nthemselves to bits. But amateurs can make valuable contributions in fields from rocketry to\npalaeontology and the rise of the Internet has made it easier than before to collect data and\ndistribute results.\nExactly which field of study has benefited most from the contributions of amateurs is a\nmatter of some dispute. Dr Fienberg makes a strong case for astronomy. There is, he\npoints out, a long tradition of collaboration between amateur and professional sky\nwatchers. Numerous comets, asteroids and even the planet Uranus were discovered by\namateurs. Today, in addition to comet and asteroid spotting, amateurs continue to do\nvaluable work observing the brightness of variable stars and detecting novae- ‘new’ stars in\nthe Milky Way and supernovae in other galaxies. Amateur observers are helpful, says Dr\nFienberg, because there are so many of them (they far outnumber professionals) and\nbecause they are distributed all over the world. This makes special kinds of observations\npossible:’ if several observers around the world accurately record the time when a star is\neclipsed by an asteroid, for example, it is possible to derive useful information about the\nasteroid’s shape.\nAnother field in which amateurs have traditionally played an important role is\npalaeontology. Adrian Hunt, a palaeontologist at Mesa Technical College in New Mexico,\ninsists that his is the field in which amateurs have made the biggest contribution. Despite\nthe development of high-tech equipment, he says, the best sensors for finding fossils are\nhuman eyes – lots of them.\nFinding volunteers to look for fossils is not difficult, he says, because of the near universal\ninterest in anything to do with dinosaurs. As well as helping with this research, volunteers\nlearn about science, a process he calls ‘recreational education’.\n \n1\n\nRick Bonney of the Cornell Laboratory of Ornithology in Ithaca, New York, contends that\namateurs have contributed the most in his field. There are, he notes, thought to be as many\nas 60 million birdwatchers in America alone. Given their huge numbers and the wide\ngeographical coverage they provide, Mr Bonney has enlisted thousands of amateurs in a\nnumber of research projects. Over the past few years their observations have uncovered\npreviously unknown trends and cycles in bird migrations and revealed declines in the\nbreeding populations of several species of migratory birds, prompting a habitat\nconservation programme.\nDespite the successes and whatever the field of study, collaboration between amateurs\nand professionals is not without its difficulties. Not everyone, for example is happy with the\nterm ‘amateur’. Mr Bonney has coined the term ‘citizen scientist’ because he felt that other\nwords, such as ‘volunteer’ sounded disparaging. A more serious problem is the question of\nhow professionals can best acknowledge the contributions made by amateurs. Dr Fienberg\nsays that some amateur astronomers are happy to provide their observations but grumble\nabout not being reimbursed for out-of-pocket expenses. Others feel let down when their\nobservations are used in scientific papers, but they are not listed as co-authors. Dr Hunt\nsays some amateur palaeontologists are disappointed when told that they cannot take finds\nhome with them.\nThese are legitimate concerns but none seems insurmountable. Provided amateurs and\nprofessionals agree the terms on which they will work together beforehand, there is no\nreason why co-operation between the two groups should not flourish. Last year Dr S.\nCarlson, founder of the Society for Amateur Scientists won an award worth $290,000 for\nhis work in promoting such co-operation. He says that one of the main benefits of the prize\nis the endorsement it has given to the contributions of amateur scientists, which has done\nmuch to silence critics among those professionals who believe science should remain their\nexclusive preserve.\nAt the moment, says Dr Carlson, the society is involved in several schemes including an\ninnovative rocket-design project and the setting up of a network of observers who will\nsearch for evidence of a link between low- frequency radiation and earthquakes. The\namateurs, he says, provide enthusiasm and talent, while the professionals provide\nguidance ‘so that anything they do discover will be taken seriously’. Having laid the\nfoundations of science, amateurs will have much to contribute to its ever – expanding\nedifice.\n-------------------------------\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nSmall Tip\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n-Read through the summary at normal speed so that you have a fair idea of what it is\nabout.\n-Check the instructions: you can use a maximum of two words for each answer and\nthese words must be taken from the reading passage.
