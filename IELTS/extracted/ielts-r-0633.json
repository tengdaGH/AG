But today, tourism and climate change are putting pressure on the surrounding\nenvironment. Marc Grainger reports.\nA\nThe town of Chamonix-Mont-Blanc sits in a valley at 1,035 metres above sea level in the\nHaute-Savoie department in south-eastern France. To the northwest are the red peaks of\nthe Aiguilles Rouges massif; to the south-east are the permanently white peaks of Mont\nBlanc, which at 4,810 metres is the highest mountain in the Alps. It’s a typical Alpine\nenvironment, but one that is under increasing strain from the hustle and bustle of human\nactivity.\nB\nTourism is Chamonix’s lifeblood. Visitors have been encouraged to visit the valley ever\nsince it was discovered by explorers in 1741. Over 40 years later, in 1786,\nMont Blanc’s summit was finally reached by a French doctor and his guide, and this gave\nbirth to the sport of alpinism, with Chamonix at its centre. In 1924, it hosted the first Winter\nOlympics, and the cable cars and lifts that were built in the years that followed gave\neveryone access to the ski slopes.\nC\nToday, Chamonix is a modern town, connected to the outside world via the Mont Blanc\nRoad Tunnel and a busy highway network. It receives up to 60,000 visitors at a time during\nthe ski season, and climbers, hikers and extreme-sports enthusiasts swarm there in the\nsummer in even greater numbers, swelling the town’s population to 100,000. It is the third\nmost visited natural site in the world, according to Chamonix’s Tourism Office and, last\nyear, it had 5.2 million visitor bed nights - all this in a town with fewer than 10,000\npermanent inhabitants.\nD\nThis influx of tourists has put the local environment under severe pressure, and the\nauthorities in the valley have decided to take action. Educating visitors is vital. Tourists are\nwarned not to drop rubbish, and there are now recycling points dotted all around the valley,\nfrom the town centre to halfway up the mountains. An internet blog reports environmental\nnews in the town, and the ‘green’ message is delivered with all the tourist office’s activities.\nE\nLow-carbon initiatives are also important for the region. France is committed to reducing its\ncarbon emissions by a factor of four by 2050. Central to achieving this aim is a strategy that\nencourages communities to identify their carbon emissions on a local level and make plans\nto reduce them. Studies have identified that accommodation accounts for half of all\ncarbon emissions in the Chamonix valley. Hotels are known to be inefficient operations, but\nthose around Chamonix are now cleaning up their act. Some are using low-energy lighting,\n \n1\n\nrestricting water use and making recycling bins available for guests; others have invested\nin huge projects such as furnishing and decorating using locally sourced materials, using\ngeothermal energy for heating and installing solar panels.\nF\nChamonix’s council is encouraging the use of renewable energy in private properties too,\nby making funds available for green renovations and new constructions. At the same time,\npublic- sector buildings have also undergone improvements to make them more energy\nefficient and less wasteful. For example, the local ice rink has reduced its annual water\nconsumption from 140,000 cubic metres to 10,000 cubic metres in the space of three\nyears.\nG\nImproving public transport is another feature of the new policy, as 80 percent of\ncarbon emissions from transport used to come from private vehicles. While the Mont Blanc\nExpress is an ideal way to travel within the valley - and see some incredible scenery along\nthe route - it is much more difficult to arrive in Chamonix from outside by rail. There is no\ndirect line from the closest airport in Geneva, so tourists arriving by air normally transfer by\ncar or bus. However, at a cost of 3.3 million euros a year, Chamonix has introduced a free\nshuttle service in order to get people out of their cars and into buses fitted with particle\nfilters.\nH\nIf the valley’s visitors and residents want to know why they need to reduce their\nenvironmental impact, they just have to look up; the effects of climate change are there for\neveryone to see in the melting glaciers that cling to the mountains. The fragility of the\nAlpine environment has long been a concern among local people. Today, 70 percent of the\n805 square kilometres that comprise Chamonix-Mont-Blanc is protected in some way. But\nnow, the impact of tourism has led the authorities to recognise that more must be done if\nthe valley is to remain prosperous: that they must not only protect the natural environment\nbetter, but also manage the numbers of visitors better, so that its residents can happily\nremain there.\n \n2",
