  "passage_text": "Reading Practice\n \nDevelopment of Adolescence (The Adolescence)\nA\nThe American Academy of Pediatrics recognizes three stages of adolescence. These are\nearly, middle and late adolescence, and each has its own developmental tasks. Teenagers\nmove through these tasks at their own speed depending on their physical development and\nhormone levels. Although these stages are common to all teenagers, each child will go\nthrough them in his or her own highly individual ways.\nB\nDuring the early years young people make the first attempts to leave the dependent,\nsecure role of a child and to establish themselves as unique individuals, independent of\ntheir parents. Early adolescence is marked by rapid physical growth and maturation. The\nfocus of adolescents’ self-concepts is thus often on their physical self and their evaluation\nof their physical acceptability. Early adolescence is also a period of intense conformity to\npeers. ‘Getting along,’ not being different, and being accepted seem somehow pressing to\nthe early adolescent. The worst possibility, from the view of the early adolescent, is to be\nseen by peers as ‘different’.\nC\nMiddle adolescence is marked by the emergence of new thinking skills. The intellectual\nworld of the young person is suddenly greatly expanded. Their concerns about peers are\nmore directed toward their opposite sexed peers. It is also during this period that the move\nto establish psychological independence from one’s parents accelerates. Delinquency\nbehavior may emerge since parental views are no longer seen as absolutely correct by\nadolescents. Despite some delinquent behavior, middle adolescence is a period during\nwhich young people are oriented toward what is right and proper. They are developing a\nsense of behavioral maturity and learning to control their impulsiveness.\nD\nLate adolescence is marked by the final preparations for adult roles. The developmental\ndemands of late adolescence often extend into the period that we think of as young\nadulthood. Late adolescents attempt to crystallize their vocational goals and to establish a\nsense of personal identity. Their needs for peer approval are diminished and they are\nlargely psychologically independent from their parents. The shift to adulthood is nearly\ncomplete.\nE\nSome years ago, Professor Robert Havighurst of the University of Chicago proposed that\nstages in human development can best be thought of in terms of the developmental tasks\nthat are part of the normal transition. He identified eleven developmental tasks associated\nwith the adolescent transition. One developmental task an adolescent needs to achieve is\nto adjust to a new physical sense of self. At no other time since birth does an individual\nundergo such rapid and profound physical changes as during early adolescence. Puberty is\nmarked by sudden rapid growth in height and weight. Also, the young person experiences\nthe emergence and accentuation of those physical traits that make him or her a boy or girl.\n \n1\n\nThe effect of this rapid change is that young adolescent often becomes focused on his or\nher body.\nF\nBefore adolescence, children’s thinking is dominated by a need to have a concrete\nexample for any problem that they solve. Their thinking is constrained to what is real and\nphysical. During adolescence, young people begin to recognize and understand\nabstractions. The adolescent must adjust to increased cognitive demands at school. Adults\nsee high school in part as a place where adolescents prepare for adult roles and\nresponsibilities and in part as preparatory for further education. School curricula are\nfrequently dominated by the inclusion of more abstract, demanding material, regardless of\nwhether the adolescents have achieved formal thought. Since not all adolescents make the\nintellectual transition at the same rate, demands for abstract thinking prior to achievement\nof that ability may be frustrating.\nG\nDuring adolescence, as teens develop increasingly complex knowledge systems and a\nsense of self, they also adopt an integrated set of values and morals. During the early\nstages of moral development, parents provide their child with a structured set of rules of\nwhat is right and wrong, what is acceptable and unacceptable. Eventually, the adolescent\nmust assess the parents’ values as they come into conflict with values expressed by peers\nand other segments of society. To reconcile differences, the adolescent restructures those\nbeliefs into a personal ideology.\nH\nThe adolescent must develop expanded verbal skills. As adolescents mature intellectually,\nas they face increased school demands, and as they prepare for adult roles, they must\ndevelop new verbal skills to accommodate more complex concepts and tasks. Their limited\nlanguage of childhood is no longer adequate. Adolescents may appear less competent\nbecause of their inability to express themselves meaningfully.\nI\nThe adolescent must establish emotional and psychological independence from his or her\nparents. Childhood is marked by a strong dependence on one’s parents. Adolescents may\nyearn to keep that safe, secure, supportive, dependent relationship. Yet, to be an adult\nimplies a sense of independence, of autonomy, of being one’s own person. Adolescents\nmay vacillate between their desire for dependence and their need to be independent. In an\nattempt to assert their need for independence and individuality, adolescents may respond\nwith what appears to be hostility and lack of cooperation.\nJ\nAdolescents do not progress through these multiple developmental tasks separately. At\nany given time, adolescents may be dealing with several. Further, the centrality of specific\ndevelopmental tasks varies with early, middle, and late periods of the transition.\n \n2",
