  "passage_text": "Reading Practice\n \nMotivating Employees under Adverse Conditions\nTHE CHALLENGE\nIt is a great deal easier to motivate employees in a growing organisation than a declining\none. When organisations are expanding and adding personnel, promotional\nopportunities, pay rises, and the excitement of being associated with a dynamic\norganisation create feelings of optimism. Management is able to use the growth to entice\nand encourage employees. When an organisation is shrinking, the best and most mobile\nworkers are prone to leave voluntarily. Unfortunately, they are the ones the organisation\ncan least afford to lose - those with the highest skills and experience. The minor employees\nremain because their job options are limited.\nMorale also suffers during decline. People fear they may be the next to be made\nredundant. Productivity often suffers, as employees spend their time sharing rumours\nand providing one another with moral support rather than focusing on their jobs. For those\nwhose jobs are secure, pay increases are rarely possible. Pay cuts, unheard of during\ntimes of growth, may even be imposed. The challenge to management is how to motivate\nemployees under such retrenchment conditions. The ways of meeting this challenge can\nbe broadly divided into six Key Points, which are outlined below.\nKEY POINT ONE\nThere is an abundance of evidence to support the motivational benefits that result from\ncarefully matching people to jobs. For example, if the job is running a small business or\nan autonomous unit within a larger business, high achievers should be sought. However, if\nthe ob to be filled is a managerial post in a large bureaucratic organisation, a candidate\nwho las a high need for power and a low need for affiliation should be selected.\nAccordingly, iigh achievers should not be put into jobs that are inconsistent with their\nneeds. High achievers will do best when the job provides moderately challenging goals and\nwhere there is independence and feedback. However, it should be remembered that not\neverybody is motivated by jobs that are high in independence, variety and responsibility.\nKEY POINT TWO\nThe literature on goal-setting theory suggests that managers should ensure that all\nemployees have specific goals and receive comments on how well they are doing in those\ngoals. For those with high achievement needs, typically a minority in any organisation, the\nexistence of external goals is less important because high achievers are already internally\nmotivated. The next factor to be determined is whether the goals should be assigned by a\nmanager or collectively set in conjunction with the employees. The answer to that depends\non perceptions of goal acceptance and the organisation's culture. If resistance to goals is\nexpected, the use of participation in goal-setting should increase acceptance. If\nparticipation is inconsistent with the culture, however, goals should be assigned. If\nparticipation and the culture are incongruous, employees are likely to perceive the\nparticipation process as manipulative and be negatively affected by it.\nKEY POINT THREE\nRegardless of whether goals are achievable or well within management's perceptions of\nthe employee's ability, if employees see them as unachievable they will reduce their\n \n1\n\neffort. Managers must be sure, therefore, that employees feel confident that their efforts\ncan lead to performance goals. For managers, this means that employees must have the\ncapability of doing the job and must regard the appraisal process as valid.\nKEY POINT FOUR\nSince employees have different needs, what acts as a reinforcement for one may not for\nanother. Managers could use their knowledge of each employee to personalise the\nrewards over which they have control. Some of the more obvious rewards that managers\nallocate include pay, promotions, autonomy, job scope and depth, and the opportunity to\nparticipate in goal-setting and decision-making.\nKEY POINT FIVE\nManagers need to make rewards contingent on performance. To reward factors other than\nperformance will only reinforce those other factors. Key rewards such as pay increases\nand promotions or advancements should be allocated for the attainment of the employee's\nspecific goals. Consistent with maximising the impact of rewards, managers should look for\nways to increase their visibility. Eliminating the secrecy surrounding pay oy openly\ncommunicating everyone's remuneration, publicising performance bonuses and allocating\nannual salary increases in a lump sum rather than spreading them out over an entire year\nare examples of actions that will make rewards more visible and potentially more\nmotivating.\nKEY POINT SIX\nThe way rewards are distributed should be transparent so that employees perceive that\nrewards or outcomes are equitable and equal to the inputs given. On a simplistic\nlevel, experience, abilities, effort and other obvious inputs should explain differences in\npay, responsibility and other obvious outcomes. The problem, however, is complicated by\nthe existence of dozens of inputs and outcomes and by the fact that employee groups\nplace different degrees of importance on them. For instance, a study comparing clerical\nand production workers identified nearly twenty inputs and outcomes, me clerical\nworkers considered factors such as quality of work performed and job knowledge near the\ntop of their list, but these were at the bottom of the production workers' list. Similarly,\nproduction workers thought that the most important inputs were intelligence and personal\ninvolvement with task accomplishment, two factors that were quite low in the importance\nratings of the clerks. There were also important, though less dramatic, differences on the\noutcome side. For example, production workers rated advancement very highly, whereas\nclerical workers rated advancement in the lower third of their list. Such findings suggest\nthat one person's equity is another's inequity, so an ideal should probably weigh different\ninputs and outcomes according to employee group.\n \n2",
