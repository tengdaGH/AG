  "passage_text": "Reading Practice\n \nE-training\nA \nE-learning is the unifying term to describe the fields of online learning, web-based training,\nand technology-delivered instruction, which can be a great benefit to corporate e-learning.\nIBM, for instance, claims that the institution of its e-training program, Basic Blue, whose\npurpose is to train new managers, saved the company in the range of $200 million in 1999.\nCutting the travel expenses required to bring employees and instructors to a central\nclassroom account for the lion’s share of the savings. With an online course, employees\ncan learn from any Internet-connected PC, anywhere in the world. Ernst and Young\nreduced training costs by 35 percent while improving consistency and scalability.\nB\nIn addition to generally positive economic benefits, other advantages such as convenience,\nstandardized delivery, self-paced learning, and a variety of available content, have made e-\nlearning a high priority for many corporations. E-learning is widely believed to offer flexible\n“any time, any place” learning. The claim for “any place” is valid in principle and is a great\ndevelopment. Many people can engage with rich learning materials that simply were not\npossible in a paper of broadcast distance learning era. For teaching specific information\nand skills, e-training holds great promise. It can be especially effective at helping\nemployees prepare for IT certification programs. E-learning also seems to effectively\naddress topics such as sexual harassment education’, safety training and management\ntraining – all areas where a clear set of objectives can be identified. Ultimately, training\nexperts recommend a “blended” approach that combines both online and in-person training\nas the instruction requires. E-learning is not an end-all solution. But if it helps decrease\ncosts and windowless classrooms filled with snoring students, it definitely has its\nadvantages.\nC\nMuch of the discussion about implementing e-learning has focused on the technology, but\nas Driscoll and others have reminded us, e-learning is not just about the technology, but\nalso many human factors. As any capable manager knows, teaching employees new skills\nis critical to a smoothly run business. Having said that, however, the traditional route of\nclassroom instruction runs the risk of being expensive, slow and, oftentimes, ineffective.\nPerhaps the classroom’s greatest disadvantage is the fact that it takes employees out of\ntheir jobs. Every minute an employee is sitting in a classroom training session is a minute\nthey’re not out on the floor working. It now looks as if there is a way to circumvent these\ntraditional training drawbacks. E-training promises more effective teaching techniques by\nintegrating audio, video, animation, text and interactive materials with the intent of teaching\neach student at his or her own pace. In addition to higher performance results, there are\nother immediate benefits to students such as increased time on task, higher levels of\nmotivation, and reduced test anxiety for many learners.\nD\nOn the other hand, nobody said E-training technology would be cheap. E-training service\nproviders, on the average, charge from $10,000 to $60,000 to develop one hour of online\n \n1\n\ninstruction. This price varies depending on the complexity of the training topic and the\nmedia used. HTML pages are a little cheaper to develop while streaming-video\npresentations or flash animations cost more. Course content is just the starting place for\nthe cost. A complete e-learning solution also includes the technology platform (the\ncomputers, applications and network connections that are used to deliver the courses).\nThis technology platform, known as a learning management system (LMS), can either be\ninstalled onsite or outsourced. Add to that cost the necessary investments in network\nbandwidth to deliver multimedia courses, and you’re left holding one heck of a bill. For the\nLMS infrastructure and a dozen or so online courses, costs can top $500,000 in the first\nyear. These kinds of costs mean that custom e-training is, for the time being, an option only\nfor large organizations. For those companies that have a large enough staff, the e-training\nconcept pays for itself. Aware of this fact, large companies are investing heavily in online\ntraining. Today, over half of the 400-plus courses that Rockwell Collins offers are delivered\ninstantly to its clients in an e-learning format, a change that has reduced its annual training\ncosts by 40%. Many other success stories exist.\nE\nE-learning isn’t expected to replace the classroom entirely. For one thing, bandwidth\nlimitations are still an issue in presenting multimedia over the Internet. Furthermore, e-\ntraining isn’t suited to every mode of instruction or topic. For instance, it’s rather ineffective\nimparting cultural values or building teams. If your company has a unique corporate culture\nis would be difficult to convey that to first-time employees through a computer monitor.\nGroup training sessions are more ideal for these purposes. In addition, there is a perceived\nloss of research time because of the work involved in developing and teaching online\nclasses. Professor Wallin estimated that it required between 500 and 1,000 person-hours,\nthat is, Wallin-hours, to keep the course at the appropriate level of currency and\nusefulness. (Distance learning instructors often need technical skills, no matter how\nadvanced the courseware system.) That amounts to between a quarter and half of a\nperson-year. Finally, teaching materials require computer literacy and access to equipment.\nAny e-Learning system involves basic equipment and a minimum level of computer\nknowledge in order to perform the tasks required by the system. A student that does not\npossess these skills, or have access to these tools, cannot succeed in an e-Learning\nprogram.\nF\nWhile few people debate the obvious advantages of e-learning, systematic research is\nneeded to confirm that learners are actually acquiring and using the skills that are being\ntaught online, and that e-learning is the best way to achieve the outcomes in a corporate\nenvironment. Nowadays, a go-between style of Blended learning, which refers to a mixing\nof different learning environments, is gaining popularity. It combines traditional face-to-face\nclassroom methods with more modern computer-mediated activities. According to its\nproponents, the strategy creates a more integrated approach for both instructors and\nlearners. Formerly, technology-based materials played a supporting role in face-to-face\ninstruction. Through a blended learning approach, technology will be more important.\n \n2",
