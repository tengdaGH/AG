The colours are magnificent, but the\nquestion of exactly why some trees turn yellow or orange, and others red or purple, is\nsomething which has long puzzled scientists.\n \nB Summer leaves are green because they are full of chlorophyll, the molecule that\ncaptures sunlight converts that energy into new building materials for the tree. As fall\napproaches in the northern hemisphere, the amount of solar energy available declines\nconsiderably. For many trees – evergreen conifers being an exception – the best strategy\nis to abandon photosynthesis* until the spring. So rather than maintaining the now\nredundant leaves throughout the winter, the tree saves its precious resources and discards\nthem. But before letting its leaves go, the tree dismantles their chlorophyll molecules and\nships their valuable nitrogen back into the twigs. As chlorophyll is depleted, other colours\nthat have been dominated by it throughout the summer begin to be revealed. This\nunmasking explains the autumn colours of yellow and orange, but not the brilliant reds and\npurples of trees such as the maple or sumac.\n \nC The source of the red is widely known: it is created by anthocyanins, water-soluble plant\npigments reflecting the red to blue range of the visible spectrum. They belong to a class of\nsugar-based chemical compounds also known as flavonoids. What’s puzzling is that\nanthocyanins are actually newly minted, made in the leaves at the same time as the tree is\npreparing to drop them. But it is hard to make sense of the manufacture of anthocyanins –\nwhy should a tree bother making new chemicals in its leaves when it’s already scrambling\nto withdraw and preserve the ones already there?\n \nD Some theories about anthocyanins have argued that they might act as a chemical\ndefence against attacks by insects or fungi, or that they might attract fruit-eating birds or\nincrease a leafs tolerance to freezing. However there are problems with each of these\ntheories, including the fact that leaves are red for such a relatively short period that the\nexpense of energy needed to manufacture the anthocyanins would outweigh any anti-\nfungal or anti-herbivore activity achieved.* photosynthesis: the production of new material\nfrom sunlight, water and carbon dioxide.\n \nE It has also been proposed that trees may produce vivid red colours to convince\nherbivorous insects that they are healthy and robust and would be easily able to mount\nchemical defences against infestation. If insects paid attention to such advertisements, they\nmight be prompted to lay their eggs on a duller, and presumably less resistant host. The\nflaw in this theory lies in the lack of proof to support it. No one has as yet ascertained\nwhether more robust trees sport the brightest leaves, or whether insects make choices\naccording to colour intensity.\nF Perhaps the most plausible suggestion as to why leaves would go to the trouble of\nmaking anthocyanins when they’re busy packing up for the winter is the theory known as\nthe ‘light screen’ hypothesis. It sounds paradoxical, because the idea behind this\nhypothesis is that the red pigment is made in autumn leaves to protect chlorophyll, the\n \n1\n\n \nlight-absorbing chemical, from too much light. Why does chlorophyll need protection when\nit is the natural world’s supreme light absorber? Why protect chlorophyll at a time when the\ntree is breaking it down to salvage as much of it as possible?\n \nG Chlorophyll, although exquisitely evolved to capture the energy of sunlight, can\nsometimes be overwhelmed by it, especially in situations of drought, low temperatures, or\nnutrient deficiency. Moreover, the problem of oversensitivity to light is even more acute in\nthe fall, when the leaf is busy preparing for winter by dismantling its internal machinery. The\nenergy absorbed by the chlorophyll molecules of the unstable autumn leaf is not\nimmediately channelled into useful products and processes, as it would be in an intact\nsummer leaf. The weakened fall leaf then becomes vulnerable to the highly destructive\neffects of the oxygen created by the excited chlorophyll molecules.\n \nH Even if you had never suspected that this is what was going on when leaves turn red,\nthere are clues out there. One is straightforward: on many trees, the leaves that are the\nreddest are those on the side of the tree which gets most sun. Not only that, but the red is\nbrighter on the upper side of the leaf. It has also been recognised for decades that the best\nconditions for intense red colours are dry, sunny days and coo nights, conditions that nicely\nmatch those that make leaves susceptible to excess light. And finally, trees such as maples\nusually get much redder the more north you travel in the northern hemisphere. It’s colder\nthere, they’re more stressed, their chlorophyll is more sensitive and it needs more\nsunblock.\nI What is still not fully understood, however, is why some trees resort to producing red\npigments while others don’t bother, and simply reveal their orange or yellow hues. Do these\ntrees have other means at their disposal to prevent overexposure to light in autumn? Their\nstory, though not as spectacular to the eye, will surely turn out to be as subtle and as\ncomplex.\n \n2",
