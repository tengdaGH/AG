  "passage_text": "Reading Practice\n \nThe Earth and Space Foundation\nThe community that focuses its efforts on the exploration of space has largely been\ndifferent from the community focused on the study and protection of the Earth's\nenvironment, despite the fact that both fields of interest involve what might be referred to as\n\"scientific exploration'. The reason for this dichotomous existence is chiefly historical. The\nexploration of the Earth has been occurring over many centuries, and the institutions\ncreated to do it are often very different from those founded in the second part of the 20th\ncentury to explore space. This separation is also caused by the fact that space exploration\nhas attracted experts from mainly non-biological disciplines - primarily engineers and\nphysicists - but the study of Earth and its environment is a domain heavily populated by\nbiologists.\nThe separation between the two communities is often reflected in attitudes. In the\nenvironmental community, it is not uncommon for space exploration to be regarded as a\nwaste of money, distracting governments from solving major environmental problems here\nat home. In the space exploration community, it is not uncommon for environmentalists to\nbe regarded as introspective people who divert attention from the more expansive visions\nof the exploration of space - the ‘new frontier’. These perceptions can also be negative in\nconsequence because the full potential of both communities can be realised better when\nthey work together to solve problems. For example, those involved in space exploration\ncan provide the satellites to monitor the Earth’s fragile environments, and environmentalists\ncan provide information on the survival of life in extreme environments.\nIn the sense that Earth and space exploration both stem from the same human drive to\nunderstand our environment and our place within it, there is no reason for the split to exist.\nA more accurate view of Earth and space exploration is to see them as a continuum of\nexploration with many interconnected and mutually beneficial links. The Earth and Space\nFoundation, a registered charity, was established for the purposes of fostering such links\nthrough field research and by direct practical action.\nProjects that have been supported by the Foundation include environmental projects using\ntechnologies resulting from space exploration: satellite communications, GPS, remote\nsensing, advanced materials and power sources. For example, in places where people are\nfaced with destruction of the forests on which their livelihood depends, rather than rejecting\neconomic progress and trying to save the forests on their intrinsic merit, another approach\nis to enhance the value of the forests - although these schemes must be carefully assessed\nto be successful. In the past, the Foundation provided a grant to a group of expeditions that\nused remote sensing to plan eco-tourism routes in the forests of Guatemala, thus providing\ncapital to the local communities through the tourist trade. This novel approach is now\nmaking the protection of the forests a sensible economic decision.\nThe Foundation funds expeditions making astronomical observations from remote, difficult-\nto-access Earth locations, archaeological field projects studying the development of early\ncivilisations that made significant contributions to astronomy and space sciences, and field\nexpeditions studying the way in which views of the astronomical environment shaped the\nnature of past civilisations. A part of Syria - ‘the Fertile Crescent’ - was the birthplace of\nastronomy, accountancy, animal domestication and many other fundamental developments\nof human civilisation. The Foundation helped fund a large archaeology project by the\n \n1\n\nSociety for Syrian Archaeology at the University of California, Los Angeles, in collaboration\nwith the Syrian government that used GPS and satellite imagery to locate mounds, or ’tels’,\ncontaining artefacts and remnants of early civilisations. These collections are being used to\nbuild a better picture of the nature of the civilisations that gave birth to astronomy.\nField research also applies the Earth’s environmental and biological resources to the\nhuman exploration and settlement of space. This may include the use of remote\nenvironments on Earth, as well as physiological and psychological studies in harsh\nenvironments. In one research project, the Foundation provided a grant to an international\ncaving expedition to study the psychology of explorers subjected to long-term isolation in\ncaves in Mexico. The psychometric tests on the cavers were used to enhance US\nastronaut selection criteria by the NASA Johnson Space Center.\nSpace-like environments on Earth help us understand how to operate in the space\nenvironment or help us characterise extraterrestrial environments for future scientific\nresearch. In the Arctic, a 24-kilometrewide impact crater formed by an asteroid or comet 23\nmillion years ago has become home tc a Mars- analogue programme. The Foundation\nhelped fund the NASA Haughton-Mars Project to use this crater to test communications\nand exploration technologies in preparation for the human exploration of Mars. The crater,\nwhich sits in high Arctic permafrost, provides an excellent replica of the physical processes\noccurring on Mars, a permafrosted, impact-altered planet. Geologists and biologists can\nwork at the site to help understand how impact craters shape the geological characteristics\nand possibly biological potential of Mars.\nIn addition to its fieldwork and scientific activities. the Foundation has award programmes.\nThese include a series of awards for the future human exploration of Mars, a location with a\ndiverse set of exploration challenges. The awards will honour a number of ‘firsts’ on Mars\nthat include landing on the surface, undertaking an overland expedition to the Martian\nSouth Pole, undertaking an overland expedition to the Martian North Pole, climbing\nOlympus Mons, the highest mountain in the solar system, and descending to the bottom of\nValles Marineris, the deepest canyon on Mars. The Foundation will offer awards for\nexpeditions further out in the solar system once these Mars awards have been claimed.\nTogether, they demonstrate that the programme really has no boundary in what it could\neventually support, and they provide longevity for the objectives of the Foundation.\n \n2",
