The oldest copier\ninvented by people is language, by which an idea of yours becomes an idea of mine. The\nsecond great copying machine was writing. When the Sumerians transposed spoken words\ninto stylus marks on clay tablets more than 5,000 years ago, the hugely extended the\nhuman network that language had created. Writing freed copying from the chain of living\ncontact. It made ideas permanent, portable and endlessly reproducible.\nB\nUntil Johann Gutenberg invented the printing press in the mid-1400s, producing a book in\nan edition of more than one generally meant writing it out again. Printing with moveable\ntype was not copying, however. Gutenberg couldn’t take a document that already existed,\nfeed it into his printing press and run off facsimiles. The first true mechanical copier was\nmanufactured in 1780, when James Watt, who is better known as the inventor of the\nmodern steam engine, created the copying press. Few people today know what a copying\npress was, but you may have seen one in an antique store, where it was perhaps called a\nbook press. A user took a document freshly written in special ink, placed a moistened sheet\nof translucent paper against the inked surface and squeezed the two sheets together in the\npress, causing some of the ink from the original to penetrate the second sheet, which could\nthen be read by turning it over and looking through its back. The high cost prohibits the\nwidespread use of this copier.\nC\nAmong the first modem copying machines, introduced in 1950 by 3M, was the Thermo-Fax,\nand it made a copy by shining infrared light through an original document and a sheet of\npaper that had been coated with heat-sensitive chemicals. Competing manufacturers soon\nintroduced other copying technologies and marketed machines called Dupliton, Dial-A-\nMatic Autostat, Verifax, Copease and Copymation. These machines and their successors\nwere welcomed by secretaries, who had no other means of reproducing documents in\nhand, but each had serious drawbacks. All required expensive chemically treated papers.\nAnd all made copies that smelled bad, were hard to read, didn’t last long and tended to curl\nup into tubes. The machines were displaced, beginning in the late 1800s, by a combination\nof two 19th century inventions: the typewriter and carbon paper. For those reasons,\ncopying presses were standard equipment in offices for nearly a century and a half.\nD\nNone of those machines is still manufactured today. They were all made obsolete by a\nradically different machine, which had been developed by an obscure photographic-supply\ncompany. That company had been founded in 1906 as the Haloid Company and is known\ntoday as the Xerox Corporation. In 1959, it introduced an office copier called the Haloid\nXerox 914, a machine that, unlike its numerous competitors, made sharp, permanent\ncopies on ordinary paper-a huge breakthrough. The process, which Haloid called\n \n1\n\nxerography (based on Greek words meaning “dry” and “writing”), was so unusual and\nnonnutritive that physicists who visited the drafty warehouses where the first machines\nwere built sometimes expressed doubt that it was even theoretically feasible.\nE\nRemarkably, xerography was conceived by one person- Chester Carlson, a shy, soft-\nspoken patent attorney, who grew up in almost unspeakable poverty and worked his way\nthrough junior college and the California Institute of Technology. Chester Carlson was born\nin Seattle in 1906. His parents-Olof Adolph Carlson and Ellen Josephine Hawkins—had\ngrown up on neighboring farms in Grove City, Minnesota, a tiny Swedish farming\ncommunity about 75 miles west of Minneapolis. Compare with competitors, Carlson was\nnot a normal inventor in 20-century. He made his discovery in solitude in 1937 and offered\nit to more than 20 major corporations, among them IBM, General Electric, Eastman Kodak\nand RCA. All of them turned him down, expressing what he later called “an enthusiastic\nlack of interest” and thereby passing up the opportunity to manufacture what Fortune\nmagazine would describe as “the most successful product ever marketed in America.”\nF\nCarlson’s invention was indeed a commercial triumph. Essentially overnight, people began\nmaking copies at a rate that was orders of magnitude higher than anyone had believed\npossible. And the rate is still growing. In fact, most documents handled by a typical\nAmerican office worker today are produced xerographically, either on copiers manufactured\nby Xerox and its competitors or on laser printers, which employ the same process (and\nwere invented, in the 1970s, by a Xerox researcher). This year, the world will produce more\nthan three trillion xerographic copies and laser-printed pages—about 500 for every human\non earth.\nG\nXerography eventually made Carlson a very wealthy man. (His royalties amounted to\nsomething like a 16th of a cent for every Xerox copy made, worldwide, through 1965.)\nNevertheless, he lived simply. He never owned a second home or a second car, and his\nwife had to urge him not to buy third-class train tickets when he traveled in Europe. People\nwho knew him casually seldom suspected that he was rich or even well-to-do; when\nCarlson told an acquaintance he worked at Xerox, the man assumed he was a factory\nworker and asked if he belonged to a union. “His possessions seemed to be composed of\nthe number of things he could easily do without,” his second wife said. He spent the last\nyears of his life quietly giving most of his fortune to charities. When he died in 1968, among\nthe eulogizers was the secretary-general of the United Nations.\n \n2",
