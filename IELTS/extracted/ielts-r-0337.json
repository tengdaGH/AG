  "passage_text": "Reading Practice\n \nPlain English Campaign\nA\nWe launched Plain English Campaign in 1979 with a ritual shredding of appalling\ngovernment and municipal council forms in Parliament Square, London. We had become\nso fed up of people visiting our advice centre in Salford, Greater Manchester, to complain\nabout incomprehensible forms that we thought we ought to take action. At the time the\nshredding seemed like merely throwing sand in the eyes of the charging lion, but it briefly\ncaught the public imagination and left an impression on government and business.\nAlthough we’re pleased with the new plain English awareness in government departments,\nmany local councils and businesses maintain a stout resistance to change. One council\nbegan a letter to its tenants about a rent increase with two sentences averaging 95 words,\nfull of bizarre housing finance jargon and waffle about Acts of Parliament. The London\nBorough of Ealing sent such an incomprehensible letter to ISO residents that 40 of them\nwrote or telephoned to complain and ask for clarification. Many were upset and frightened\nthat the council was planning to imprison them if they didn’t fill in the accompanying form.\nIn fact, the letter meant nothing of the sort, and the council had to send another letter to\nexplain.\nB\nPlain legal English can be used as a marketing tactic. Provincial Insurance issued their\nplain English Home Cover policy in 1983 and sold it heavily as such. In the first 18 months,\nits sales rocketed, drawing in about an extra £1.5 million of business. Recently, the Eagle\nStar Group launched a plain English policy to a chorus of congratulatory letters from\npolicyholders. People, it seems, prefer to buy a policy they can understand.\nC\nTwo kinds of instructions give us a lot of concern – medical labels and do-it-yourself\nproducts. With medical labels, there is a serious gap between what the professionals think\nis clear and what is really clear to patients. A survey by pharmacists Raynor and Sillito\nfound that 31% of patients misunderstood the instruction on eye drops ‘To be instilled’,\nwhile 33% misunderstood ‘Use sparingly’. The instruction ‘Take two tablets 4 hourly’ is so\nprone to misunderstanding (for example, as 8 tablets an hour) that we think it should be\nbanned. Unclear instructions on do-it-yourself products cause expense and frustration to\ncustomers. Writing the necessary instructions for these products is usually entrusted to\nsomeone who knows the product inside out, yet the best qualification for writing instructions\nis ignorance. The writer is then like a first-time user, discovering how to use the product in\na step-by-step way. Instructions never seem to be tested with first-time users before being\nissued. So vital steps are missed out or components are mislabeled or not labelled at all.\nFor example, the instructions for assembling a sliding door gear say: ‘The pendant bolt\ncentres are fixed and should be at an equal distance from the centre of the door.’ This\nneglects to explain who should do the fixing and how the bolt centres will get into the\ncorrect position. By using an imperative and an active verb the instruction becomes much\nclearer: ‘Make sure you fix the centres of the pendant bolts at an equal distance from the\ncentre of the door.’\nD\n \n1\n\nEffectively, the Plain English movement in the US began with President Jimmy Carter’s\nExecutive Order 12044 of 23 March 1978, that required regulations to be written in plain\nlanguage. There were earlier government efforts to inform consumers about their rights and\nobligations, such as the Truth in Lending Act (1969) and the Fair Credit Billing Act (1975),\nwhich emphasized a body of information that consumers need in simple language. But\nPresident Carter’s executive order gave the prestige and force of a president to the\nmovement. All over the country isolated revolts or efforts against legalistic gobbledygook at\nthe federal, state and corporate levels seemed to grow into a small revolution. These\nefforts and advances between the years 1978 and 1985 are described in the panel ‘The\nPlain English Scorecard’.\nE\nThe Bastille has not fallen yet. The forces of resistance are strong, as one can see from the\ncase of Pennsylvania as cited in the Scorecard. In addition, President Ronald Reagan’s\nexecutive order of 19 February 1981, revoking President Carter’s earlier executive order,\nhas definitely slowed the pace of plain English legislation in the United States. There are\nthere main objections to the idea of plain English. They are given below, with the\ncampaign’s answer to them:\nF\nThe statute would cause unending litigation and clog the courts. Simply not true in all the\nten states with plain English laws for consumer contracts and the 34 states with laws or\nregulations for insurance policies. Since 1978 when plain English law went into effect in\nNew York there have been only four litigations and only two decisions. Massachusetts had\nzero cases. The cost of compliance would be enormous. Translation of legal contracts into\nnon-legal everyday language would be a waster of time and money. The experience of\nseveral corporations has proved that the cost of compliance is often outweighed by solid\nbenefits and litigation savings. Citibank of New York made history in 1975 by introducing a\nsimplified promissory note and afterwards simplified all their forms. Citibank counsel Carl\nFalsenfield says: ‘We have lost no money and there has been no litigation as a result of\nsimplification.’ The cost-effectiveness of clarity is demonstrable. A satisfied customer more\nreadily signs on the bottom line and thus contributes to the corporation’s bottom line. Some\ndocuments simply can’t be simplified. The only legal language that has been tested for\ncenturies in the courts is precise enough to deal with a mortgage, a deed, a lease, or an\ninsurance policy. Here, too, the experience of several corporations and insurance\ncompanies has proved that contracts and policies can be made more understandable\nwithout sacrificing legal effectiveness.\nG\nWhat does the future hold for the Plain English movement? Today, American consumers\nare buffeted by an assortment of pressures. Never before have consumers had as many\nchoices in areas like financial services, travel, telephone services, and supermarket\nproducts. There are about 300 long-distance phone companies in the US. Not long ago, the\naverage supermarket carried 9,000 items; today, it carries 22,000. More importantly, this\nexpansion of options – according to a recent report – is faced by a staggering 30 million\nAmericans lacking the reading skills to handle the minimal demands of daily living. The\nconsumer’s need, therefore, for information expressed in plain English is more critical than\never.\n \n2\n\nH\nWhat is needed today is not a brake on the movement’s momentum but another push\ntoward plain English contracts from consumers. I still hear plain English on the TV and in\nthe streets, and read plain English in popular magazines and best-sellers, but not yet in\nmany functional documents. Despite some victories, the was against gobbledygook is not\nover yet. We do well to remember, the warning of Chrissie Maher, organizer of Plain\nEnglish Campaign in the UK: ‘People are not just injured when medical labels are written in\ngobbledygook – they die. Drivers are not just hurt when their medicines don’t tell them they\ncould fall asleep at the wheel – they are killed.’\n \n3",
