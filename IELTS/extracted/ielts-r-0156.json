  "passage_text": "Reading Practice\n \nExploring british village 2\n{A} The Neolithic longhouse was a long, narrow timber dwelling built by the first farmers\nin Europe beginning at least as early as the period 5000 to 6000 BC. The origin of the\nname blackhouse is of some debate. It could be less than 150 years old and may have\nbeen synonymous with inferior. On Lewis, in particular, it seems to have been used to\ndistinguish the older blackhouses from some of the newer white-houses (Scottish Gaelic:\ntaigh-geal, Irish: tí geal, tí bán), with their mortared stone walls. There may also be some\nconfusion arising from the phonetic similarity between the ‘dubh’ , meaning black and\ntaghadh meaning thatch. The houses in Scotland were built high rather than wide;\nhowever, some were built small and wide.\n \n{B} The buildings were generally built with double-wall dry-stone walls packed with earth\nand wooden rafters covered with a thatch of turf with cereal straw or reed. The floor was\ngenerally flagstones or packed earth and there was a central hearth for the fire. There was\nno chimney for the smoke to escape through. Instead, the smoke made its way through the\nroof. The blackhouse was used to accommodate livestock as well as people. People lived\nat one end and the animals lived at the other with a partition between them. \n{C} It is estimated that there are over ten thousand villages in Britain, yet defining the term\n‘village’ isn’t as simple as it may at first sound. When does a hamlet become a village? And\nwhen does a village become a town?\n{D} Strictly speaking the term ‘village’ comes from the Latin ‘villaticus’, which roughly\ntranslates as ‘a group of houses outside a villa farmstead’. Today a village is understood as\na collection of buildings (usually at least 20) that is larger than a hamlet, yet smaller than a\ntown, and which contains at least one communal or public building. This is most commonly\nthe parish church, though it can be a chapel, school, public house, shop, post office, smithy\nor mill. Villagers will share communal resources such as access roads, a water supply, and\nusually a place of worship\n \n{E} A hamlet is a smaller grouping of buildings that don’t necessarily have any public or\nservice buildings to support it. A significant difference is that it won’t have a parish church\nlike a village does, and most hamlets contain only between three and twenty buildings.\n{F} The point at which a village becomes a town is difficult to determine and is probably\nbest defined by those who live there. However, since the Middle Ages, the term ‘town’ has\nbeen a legal term that refers to the fact that the community has a borough charter. The\nsituation is confused by the fact that there are many town-like suburban communities\ncalling themselves villages (for example, Oxton Village in Birkenhead), as well as designed\nsuburban ‘villages’ such as those built under the Garden Village Movement.\n{G} The 2001 census shows us that approx 80% of people in England live in an urban\nenvironment, with under 7% living in rural villages (the remainder live in rural towns or\noutside concentrated settlements). This is the exact opposite of the situation two centuries\nago, when under 20% of the population lived in the town, and the majority lived in rural\nvillages. As late as 1851 agriculture remained the largest single source of employment in\nBritain, yet today under 3% of us work on the land.\n \n1\n\n \n{H} It is essential to remember that villages were created and have evolved because of\nparticular combinations of geographical, commercial, economic and social factors. They\nexpand, decline, move and fluctuate with the times. This article introduces some of the\ncommon forms of the village to be found in Britain.\nThe Medieval Village\n \n{I} When we think of a British village we probably imagine a settlement of traditional\ncottages around a village green with a church and ancient manor house as a backdrop.\nThis common form of the village has its roots in the medieval period when many villages\nstarted out as a cluster of agricultural dwellings\n{J} Today farmsteads tend to be scattered about the landscape, but back in the medieval\nperiod those working on the land tended to live in small nucleated settlements (villages)\nand worked ‘open-field’ agriculture where land wasn’t enclosed. In fact, over much of\nBritain in the period up to 1800, it would have been unusual to have seen a farm or cottage\noutside of a settlement boundary. \n{K} By the time that the Domesday Book was written in 1086 most of the good agricultural\nland in Britain was already under cultivation, and England was a densely populated\ncountry. Two centuries later nucleated settlements were to be found over much of Britain,\ntypically consisting of well-organised village settlements sitting within open fields.\n \n{L} Over lowland Britain on good soil you would typically find a settlement every couple of\nmiles, and the communities would use the open agricultural land around where they lived.\nThe average village would have its church, manor house, and cottage tenements all\nclustered together, and the open land around would usually be divided into thin strips. In\nsome villages, you can still see the remnants of medieval strip field systems around the\nperiphery of the settlement. There would often be meadows, pasture and woodland held ‘in\ncommon, and only the lord of the manor would have his own, private land or ‘demesne’. In\nthe medieval village, virtually everyone would have earned their living on the territory,\nhence the community had to be relatively self-sufficient.\n{M} ‘Green Villages’ were a common village form, where houses clustered around a central\ngreen of common land. They are often the remnants of planned settlements introduced\nafter the Norman Conquest in the 19th century. It is suggested that this arrangement\nallowed for easier defence, especially compared to the village form most common before\nthe Normans, which was simple clusters of farms. However there is also evidence of\n‘village’ greens in Anglo-Saxon settlements, and even at Romano-British sites.\n{N} The village green was soon adopted as the main social space within a village, as well\nas its focal point alongside the church or chapel. Village greens often take a triangular\nform, usually reflecting the fact that the village was at the meeting of three roads. The\ncontinuing importance of the village green to modern-day communities is reflected in the\nfact that this is usually where the war memorial is seen, as well as village notice boards,\nwhere local cricket matches are played, and where public benches are placed. The Open\nSpaces Society states that in 2005 there were about 3,650 registered greens in England\nand about 220 in Wales. \n \n2",
