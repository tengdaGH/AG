  "passage_text": "Reading Practice\n \nWilliam Kamkwamba\nAt only 14 years old, William Kamkwamba built a series of windmills that could generate\nelectricity in his African village, Masitala, in Malawi, south-eastern Africa.\nIn 2002, William Kamkwamba had to drop out of school, as his father, a maize and tobacco\nfarmer, could no longer afford his school fees. But despite this setback, William was\ndetermined to get his education. He began visiting a local library that had just opened in his\nold primary school, where he discovered a tattered science book. With only a rudimentary\ngrasp of English, he taught himself basic physics - mainly by studying photos and\ndiagrams. Another book he found there featured windmills on the cover and inspired him to\ntry and build his own.\nHe started by constructing a small model. Then, with the help of a cousin and friend, he\nspent many weeks searching scrap yards and found old tractor fans, shock absorbers,\nplastic pipe and bicycle parts, which he used to build the real thing.\nFor windmill blades, William cut some bath pipe in two lengthwise, then heated the pieces\nover hot coals to press the curled edges flat. To bore holes into the blades, he stuck a nail\nthrough half a corncob, heated the metal red and twisted it through the blades. It took three\nhours to repeatedly heat the nail and bore the holes. He attached the blades to a tractor fan\nusing proper nuts and bolts and then to the back axle of a bicycle. Electricity was\ngenerated through the bicycle dynamo. When the wind blew the blades, the bike chain\nspun the bike wheel, which charged the dynamo and sent a current through wire to his\nhouse.\nWhat he had built was a crude machine that produced 12 volts and powered four lights.\nWhen it was all done, the windmill's wingspan measured more than eight feet and sat on\ntop of a rickety tower 15 feet tall that swayed violently in strong gales. He eventually\nreplaced the tower with a sturdier one that stands 39 feet, and built a second machine that\nwatered a family garden.\n \nThe windmill brought William Kamkwamba instant local fame, but despite his\naccomplishment, he was still unable to return to school. However, news of his magetsi a\nmphepo - electric wind - spread beyond Malawi, and eventually things began to change. An\neducation official, who had heard news of the windmill, came to visit his village and was\namazed to learn that William had been out of school for five years. He arranged for him to\nattend secondary school at the government's expense and brought journalists to the farm\nto see the windmill. Then a story published in the Malawi Daily Mail caught the attention of\nbloggers, which in turn caught the attention of organisers for the Technology Entertainment\nand Design conference.\nIn 2007, William spoke at the TED Global conference in Tanzania and got a standing\novation. Businessmen stepped forward with offers to fund his education and projects, and\nwith money donated by them, he was able to put his cousin and several friends back into\nschool and pay for some medical needs of his family. With the donation, he also drilled a\nborehole for a well and water pump in his village and installed drip irrigation in his father's\nfields.\nThe water pump has allowed his family to expand its crops. They have abandoned tobacco\n \n1\n\nand now grow maize, beans, soybeans, potatoes and peanuts. The windmills have also\nbrought big lifestyle and health changes to the other villagers. 'The village has changed a\nlot/ William says. 'Now, the time that they would have spent going to fetch water, they are\nusing for doing other things. And also the water they are drinking is clean water, so there is\nless disease.' The villagers have also stopped using kerosene and can use the money\npreviously spent on fuel to buy other things.\nWilliam Kamkwamba's example has inspired other children in the village to pursue science.\nWilliam says they now see that if they put their mind to something, they can achieve it. 'It\nhas changed the way people think' he says.\n \n2",
