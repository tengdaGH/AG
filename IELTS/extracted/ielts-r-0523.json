  "passage_text": "Reading Practice\n \nThe Nature of Genius\nThere has always been ari interest in geniuses and prodigies. The word ‘genius’, from the\nLatin gens (= family) and the term ‘genius’, meaning ‘begetter’, comes from the early\nRoman cult of a divinity as the head of the family. In its earliest form, genius\nwas concerned with the ability of the head of the family, the paterfamilias, to\nperpetuate himself. Gradually, genius came to represent a person’s characteristics and\nthence an individual’s highest attributes derived from his ‘genius’ or guiding spirit. Today,\npeople still look to stars or genes, astrology or genetics, in the hope of finding the source\nof exceptional abilities or personal characteristics.\nThe concept of genius and of gifts has become part of our folk culture, and attitudes are\nambivalent towards them. We envy the gifted and mistrust them. In the mythology of\ngiftedness, it is popularly believed that if people are talented in one area, they must be\ndefective in another, that intellectuals are impractical, that prodigies burn too brightly too\nsoon and burn out, that gifted people are eccentric, that they are physical weaklings, that\nthere’s a thin line between genius and madness, that genius runs in families, that the gifted\nare so clever they don’t need special help, that giftedness is the same as having a high IQ,\nthat some races are more intelligent or musical or mathematical than others, that genius\ngoes unrecognised and unrewarded, that adversity makes men wise or that people with\ngifts have a responsibility to use them. Language has been enriched with such terms as\n‘highbrow’, ‘egghead’, ‘blue-stocking’, ‘wiseacre’, ‘know-all’, ‘boffin’ and, for many,\n‘intellectual’ is a term of denigration.\nThe nineteenth century saw considerable interest in the nature of genius, and produced not\na few studies of famous prodigies. Perhaps for us today, two of the most significant aspects\nof most of these studies of genius are the frequency with which early encouragement and\nteaching by parents and tutors had beneficial effects on the intellectual, artistic or musical\ndevelopment of the children but caused great difficulties of adjustment later in their lives,\nand the frequency with which abilities went unrecognised by teachers and schools.\nHowever, the difficulty with the evidence produced by these studies, fascinating as they are\nin collecting together anecdotes and apparent similarities and exceptions, is that they are\nnot what we would today call norm-referenced. In other words, when, for instance,\ninformation is collated about early illnesses, methods of upbringing, schooling, etc., we\nmust also take into account information from other historical sources about how common or\nexceptional these were at the time. For instance, infant mortality was high and life\nexpectancy much shorter than today, home tutoring was common in the families of the\nnobility and wealthy, bullying and corporal punishment were common at the best\nindependent schools and, for the most part, the cases studied were members of the\nprivileged classes. It was only with the growth of paediatrics and psychology in the\ntwentieth century that studies could be carried out on a more objective, if still not always\nvery scientific, basis.\nGeniuses, however they are defined, are but the peaks which stand out through the mist of\nhistory and are visible to the particular observer from his or her particular vantage point.\nChange the observers and the vantage points, clear away some of the mist, and a different\nlot of peaks appear. Genius is a term we apply to those whom we recognise for their\noutstanding achievements and who stand near the end of the continuum of human abilities\nwhich reaches back through the mundane and mediocre to the incapable. There is still\n \n1\n\nmuch truth in Dr Samuel Johnson’s observation, The true genius Is a mind of large general\npowers, accidentally determined to some particular direction’. We may disagree with the\n‘general’, for we doubt if all musicians of genius could have become scientists of genius or\nvice versa, but there is no doubting the accidental determination which nurtured or\ntriggered their gifts into those channels into which they have poured their powers so\nsuccessfully.

But before we try to\nemulate geniuses or encourage our children to do so we should note that some of the\nthings we learn from them may prove unpalatable. We may envy their achievements and\nfame, but we should also recognise the price they may have paid in terms of perseverance,\nsingle-mindedness, dedication, restrictions on their personal lives, the demands upon their\nenergies and time, and how often they had to display great courage to preserve their\nintegrity or to make their way to the top.\nGenius and giftedness are relative descriptive terms of no real substance.
