  "passage_text": "Reading Practice\n \nSheet glass manufacture: the float process\nGlass, which has been made since the time of the Mesopotamians and Egyptians, is little\nmore than a mixture of sand, soda ash and lime. When heated to about 1500 degrees\nCelsius (°C) this becomes a molten mass that hardens when slowly cooled. The first\nsuccessful method for making clear, flat glass involved spinning. This method was very\neffective as the glass had not touched any surfaces between being soft and becoming\nhard, so it stayed perfectly unblemished, with a 'fire finish'. However, the process took a\nlong time and was labour intensive.\nNevertheless, demand for flat glass was very high and glassmakers across the world were\nlooking for a method of making it continuously. The first continuous ribbon process\ninvolved squeezing molten glass through two hot rollers, similar to an old mangle. This\nallowed glass of virtually any thickness to be made non-stop, but the rollers would leave\nboth sides of the glass marked, and these would then need to be ground and polished. This\npart of the process rubbed away around 20 per cent of the glass, and the machines were\nvery expensive.\nThe float process for making flat glass was invented by Alistair Pilkington. This process\nallows the manufacture of clear, tinted and coated glass for buildings, and clear and\ntinted glass for vehicles. Pilkington had been experimenting with improving the melting\nprocess, and in 1952 he had the idea of using a bed of molten metal to form the flat glass,\neliminating altogether the need for rollers within the float bath. The metal had to melt at a\ntemperature less than the hardening point of glass (about 600°C), but could not boil at a\ntemperature below the temperature of the molten glass (about 1500°C). The best metal for\nthe job was tin.\nThe rest of the concept relied on gravity, which guaranteed that the surface of the molten\nmetal was perfectly flat and horizontal. Consequently, when pouring molten glass onto\nthe molten tin, the underside of the glass would also be perfectly flat. If the glass were kept\nhot enough, it would flow over the molten tin until the top surface was also flat, horizontal\nand perfectly parallel to the bottom surface. Once the glass cooled to 604°C or less it was\ntoo hard to mark and could be transported out of the cooling zone by rollers. The glass\nsettled to a thickness of six millimetres because of surface tension interactions between the\nglass and the tin. By fortunate coincidence, 60 per cent of the flat glass market at that time\nwas for six-millimetre glass. \nPilkington built a pilot plant in 1953 and by 1955 he had convinced his company to build a\nfull-scale plant. However, it took 14 months of non-stop production, costing the\ncompany £100,000 a month, before the plant produced any usable glass. Furthermore,\nonce they succeeded in making marketable flat glass, the machine was turned off for a\nservice to prepare it for years of continuous production. When it started up again it took\nanother four months to get the process right again. They finally succeeded in 1959 and\nthere are now float plants all over the world, with each able to produce around 1000 tons of\nglass every day, non-stop for around 15 years.\nFloat plants today make glass of near optical quality. Several processes - melting, refining,\nhomogenising - take place simultaneously in the 2000 tonnes of molten glass in the\nfurnace. They occur in separate zones in a complex glass flow driven by high\ntemperatures. It adds up to a continuous melting process, lasting as long as 50 hours, that\n \n1\n\ndelivers glass smoothly and continuously to the float bath, and from there to a coating zone\nand finally a heat treatment zone, where stresses formed during cooling are relieved.\nThe principle of float glass is unchanged since the 1950s. However, the product has\nchanged dramatically, from a single thickness of 6.8 mm to a range from sub-millimetre to\n25 mm, from a ribbon frequently marred by inclusions and bubbles to almost optical\nperfection. To ensure the highest quality, inspection takes place at every stage.\nOccasionally, a bubble is not removed during refining, a sand grain refuses to melt, a\ntremor in the tin puts ripples into the glass ribbon. Automated on-line inspection does two\nthings. Firstly, it reveals process faults upstream that can be corrected. Inspection\ntechnology allows more than 100 million measurements a second to be made across the\nribbon, locating flaws the unaided eye would be unable to see. Secondly, it enables\ncomputers downstream to steer cutters around flaws.\nFloat glass is sold by the square metre, and at the final stage computers translate customer\nrequirements into patterns of cuts designed to minimise waste.\n \n2",
