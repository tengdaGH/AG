  "passage_text": "Reading Practice\n \n \nThe Context, Meaning and Scope of Tourism\n \nA   Travel has existed since the beginning of time, when primitive man set out, often\ntraversing great distances in search of game, which provided the food and clothing\nnecessary for his survival. Throughout the course of history, people have travelled for\npurposes of trade, religious conviction, economic gain, war, migration and other equally\ncompelling motivations. In the Roman era, wealthy aristocrats and high government\nofficials also travelled for pleasure. Seaside resorts located at Pompeii and Herculaneum\nafforded citizens the opportunity to escape to their vacation villas in order to avoid the\nsummer heat of Rome. Travel, except during the Dark Ages, has continued to grow and,\nthroughout recorded history, has played a vital role in the development of civilisations and\ntheir economies.\n \nB  Tourism in the mass form as we know it today is a distinctly twentieth-century\nphenomenon. Historians suggest that the advent of mass tourism began in England during\nthe industrial revolution with the rise of the middle class and the availability of relatively\ninexpensive transportation. The creation of the commercial airline industry following the\nSecond World War and the subsequent development of the jet aircraft in the 1950s\nsignalled the rapid growth and expansion of international travel. This growth led to the\ndevelopment of a major new industry: tourism. In turn, international tourism became the\nconcern of a number of world governments since it not only provided new employment\nopportunities but also produced a means of earning foreign exchange.\n \nC    Tourism today has grown significantly in both economic and social importance. In most\nindustrialised countries over the past few years the fastest growth has been seen in the\narea of services. One of the largest segments of the service industry, although largely\nunrecognised as an entity in some of these countries, is travel and tourism. According to\nthe World Travel and Tourism Council (1992),Travel and tourism is the largest industry in\nthe world on virtually any economic measure including value-added capital investment,\nemployment and tax contributions,. In 1992’ the industry’s gross output was estimated to\nbe $3.5 trillion, over 12 per cent of all consumer spending. The travel and tourism industry\nis the world’s largest employer the almost 130 million jobs, or almost 7 per cent of all\nemployees. This industry is the world’s leading industrial contributor, producing over 6 per\ncent of the world’s national product and accounting for capital investment in excess of $422\nbillion m direct indirect and personal taxes each year. Thus, tourism has a profound impact\nboth on the world economy and, because of the educative effect of travel and the effects on\nemployment, on society itself.\nD    However, the major problems of the travel and tourism industry that have hidden, or\nobscured, its economic impact are the diversity and fragmentation of the industry itself. The\ntravel industry includes: hotels, motels and other types of accommodation; restaurants and\nother food services; transportation services and facilities; amusements, attractions and\nother leisure facilities; gift shops and a large number of other enterprises. Since many of\nthese businesses also serve local residents, the impact of spending by visitors can easily\nbe overlooked or underestimated. In addition, Meis (1992) points out that the tourism\nindustry involves concepts that have remained amorphous to both analysts and decision\nmakers. Moreover, in all nations this problem has made it difficult for the industry to\ndevelop any type of reliable or credible tourism information base in order to estimate the\ncontribution it makes to regional, national and global economies. However, the nature of\n \n1\n\n \nthis very diversity makes travel and tourism ideal vehicles for economic development in a\nwide variety of countries, regions or communities.\nE   Once the exclusive province of the wealthy, travel and tourism have become an\ninstitutionalised way of life for most of the population. In fact, McIntosh and Goeldner\n(1990) suggest that tourism has become the largest commodity in international trade for\nmany nations and, for a significant number of other countries, it ranks second or third. For\nexample, tourism is the major source of income in Bermuda, Greece, Italy, Spain,\nSwitzerland and most Caribbean countries. In addition, Hawkins and Ritchie, quoting from\ndata published by the American Express Company, suggest that the travel and tourism\nindustry is the number one ranked employer in the Bahamas, Brazil, Canada, France, (the\nformer) West Germany, Hong Kong, Italy, Jamaica, Japan, Singapore, the United Kingdom\nand the United States. However, because of problems of definition, which directly affect\nstatistical measurement, it is not possible with any degree of certainty to provide precise,\nvalid or reliable data about the extent of world-wide tourism participation or its economic\nimpact. In many cases, similar difficulties arise when attempts are made to measure\ndomestic tourism.\n \n2",
