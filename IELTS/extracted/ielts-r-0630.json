  "passage_text": "Reading Practice\nWhen people are deaf’ to music\nMusic has long been considered a uniquely human concept. In fact, most psychologists\nagree that music is a universal human instinct. Like any ability, however, there is great\nvariation in people's musical competence. For every brilliant pianist in the world, there are\nseveral people we refer to as \" tone deaf\". It is not simply that people with tone deafness\n(or' amusia\") are unable to sing in tune, they are also unable to discriminate between tones\nor recognize familiar melodies. Such a\" disorder\" can occur after some sort of brain\ndamage , but recently research has been undertaken in an attempt to discover the cause of\ncongenital amusia (when people are born with the condition), which is not associated with\nany brain damage, hearing problems, or lack of exposure to music.\nAccording to the research of Dr. Isabelie Peretz of the University of Montreat, amusia is\nmore complicated than the inability to distinguish pitches. An amusia (a person who has the\ncondition of amusia) can distinguish between two pitches that are far apart, but cannot tell\nthe difference between intervals smaller than a half step on the Western diatonic scale,\nwhile most people can easily distinguish differences smaller than that, when listening to\nmelodies which have had a single note altered so that it is out of key with the rest of the\nmelody, do not notice a problem. As would be expected, amusics perform significantly\nworse at singing and tapping a rhythm along with a melody than do non-amusics.\nThe most fascinating aspect of amusia is how specific to music it is. Because of music’s\nclose ties\nto language, it might be expected that a musical impairment may be caused by a language\nimpairment. Studies suggest, however, that language and music ability are independent of\none another. People with brain damage in areas critical to language are often still able to\nsing, despite being unable to communicate through speech. Moreover, while amusics show\ndeficiencies in their recognition of pitch differences in melodies, they show no tonal\nlanguages, such as Chinese, do not report having any difficulty discriminating between\nwords that differ only in their intonation. The linguistic cues inherent in speech make\ndiscrimination of meaning much easier for amusics. Amusics are also successful most of\nthe time at detecting the mood of a melody, can identify a speaker based on his or her\nvoice and can discriminate and identify environmental sounds.\nRecent work has been focused on locating the part of the brain that is responsible for\namusia. The temporal lobes of the brain, the location of the primary auditory cortex, have\nbeen considered. It has long been believed that the temporal lobes, especially the right\ntemporal lobe, are most active when activity, so any musical disability should logically stem\nfrom here as well. Because it has been shown that there is no hearing deficit in amusia,\nresearchers moved on to the temporal neocortex, which is where more sophisticated\nprocessing of musical cues was thought to take place. New studies, however, have\nsuggested that the deficits in amusics are located outside the auditory cortex. Brain scans\nof amusics do not show any reaction at all to differences smaller than a half step, when\nchanges in tones are large, their brains overreact, showing twice as much activity on the\nright side of the brain as a normal brain hearing the same thing. These differences do not\noccur in the auditory cortex, indicating again that the deficits of amusia lie mostly in hearing\nimpairment, but in higher processing of melodies.\nSo what does this all mean? Looking only at the research of Peretz in the field of\n \n1\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nneuropsychology of music, it would appear that amusia is some sort of disorder. As a\nstudent of neurobiology, however, I am skeptical. Certainly the studies by Peretz that have\nfound significant differences between the brains of so-called amusics and normal brains\nare legitimate. The more important question now becomes one of normality. Every trait\nfrom skin color to intelligence to mood exists on a continuum-there is a great idea of\nvariation from one extreme to the other. Just because we recognize that basic musical\nability is something that the vast majority of people have, this doesn’t mean that the lack of\nit is abnormal\n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nWhat makes an amusic worse off than a musical prodigy? Musical ability is culturally\nvalued, and may have been a factor in survival at one point in human history, but it does\nnot seem likely that it is being selected for on an evolutionary scale any longer. Darwin\nbelieved that music was adaptive as a way of finding a mate, but who needs to be able to\nsing to find a partner in an age when it is possible to express your emotions through a song\non your IPod?\nWhile the idea of amusia is interesting, it seems to be just one end of the continuum of\ninnate musical ability. Comparing this ‘disorder’ to learning disorders like a specific\nlanguage impairment seems to be going too far. Before, amusia can be declared a\ndisability, further research must be done to determine whether lack of musical ability is\nactually detrimental in any way. If no disadvantages can be found of having amusia, then it\nis no more a disability than having poor fashion sense or bad handwriting.\n \n2",
