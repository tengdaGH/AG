  "passage_text": "Reading Practice\n \nExtinct: the Giant Deer\nToothed cats, mastodons, giant sloths, woolly rhinos, and many other big, shaggy\nmammals are widely thought to have died out around the end of the last ice age, some\n10,500 years ago.\nA\nThe Irish elk is also known as the giant deer (Megaloceros giganteus). Analysis of ancient\nbones and teeth by scientists based in Britain and Russia show the huge herbivore\nsurvived until about 5,000 B.C. – more than three millennia later than previously believed.\nThe research team says this suggests additional factors, besides climate change, probably\nhastened the giant deer’s eventual extinction. The factors could include hunting or habitat\ndestruction by humans.\nB\nThe Irish elk, so-called because its well-preserved remains are often found in lake\nsediments under peat bogs in Ireland, first appeared about 400,000 years ago in Europe\nand Central Asia. Through a combination of radiocarbon dating of skeletal remains and the\nmapping of locations where the remains were unearthed, the team shows the Irish elk was\nwidespread across Europe before the last “big freeze.” The deer’s range later contracted to\nthe Ural Mountains, in modern-day Russia, which separate Europe from Asia.\nC\nThe giant deer made its last stand in western Siberia, some 3,000 years after the ice\nsheets receded, said the study’s co-author, Adrian Lister, professor of palaeobiology at\nUniversity College London, England. “The eastern foothills of the Urals became very\ndensely forested about 8,000 years ago, which could have pushed them on to the plain,” he\nsaid. He added that pollen analysis indicates the region then became very dry in response\nto further climatic change, leading to the loss of important food plants. “In combination with\nhuman pressures, this could have finally snuffed them out,” Lister said.\nD\nHunting by humans has often been put forward as a contributory cause of extinction of the\nPleistocene megafauna. The team, though, said their new date for the Irish elk’s extinction\nhints at an additional human-made problem – habitat destruction. Lister said, “We haven’t\ngot just hunting 7,000 years ago – this was also about the time the first Neolithic people\nsettled in the region. They were farmers who would have cleared the land.” The presence\nof humans may help explain why the Irish elk was unable to tough out the latest of many\nclimatic fluctuations – periods it had survived in the past.\nE\nMeanwhile, Lister cast doubt on another possible explanation for the deer’s demise – the\nmale’s huge antlers. Some scientists have suggested this exaggerated feature – the result\nof females preferring stags with the largest antlers, possibly because they advertised a\nmale’s fitness – contributed to the mammal’s downfall. They say such antlers would have\nbeen a serious inconvenience in the dense forests that spread northward after the last ice\n \n1\n\nage. But, Lister said, “That’s a hard argument to make because the deer previously\nsurvived perfectly well through wooded interglacials [warmer periods between ice ages].”\nSome research has suggested that a lack of sufficient high-quality forage caused the\nextinction of the elk. High amounts of calcium and phosphate compounds are required to\nform antlers, and therefore large quantities of these minerals are required for the massive\nstructures of the Irish Elk. The males (and male deer in general) met this requirement partly\nfrom their bones, replenishing them from food plants after the antlers were grown or\nreclaiming the nutrients from discarded antlers (as has been observed in extant deer).\nThus, in the antler growth phase, Giant Deer was suffering from a condition similar to\nosteoporosis. When the climate changed at the end of the last glacial period, the vegetation\nin the animal’s habitat also changed towards species that presumably could not deliver\nsufficient amounts of the required minerals, at least in the western part of its range.\nF\nThe extinction of megafauna around the world was almost completed by the end of the last\nice age. It is believed that megafauna initially came into existence in response to glacial\nconditions and became extinct with the onset of warmer climates. Tropical and subtropical\nareas have experienced less radical climatic change. The most dramatic of these changes\nwas the transformation of a vast area of North Africa into the world’s largest desert.\nSignificantly, Africa escaped major faunal extinction as did tropical and sub-tropical Asia.\nThe human exodus from Africa and our entrance into the Americas and Australia were also\naccompanied by climate change. Australia’s climate changed from cold-dry to warm-dry. As\na result, surface water became scarce. Most inland lakes became completely dry or dry in\nthe warmer seasons. Most large, predominantly browsing animals lost their habitat and\nretreated to a narrow band in eastern Australia, where there were permanent water and\nbetter vegetation. Some animals may have survived until about 7000 years ago. If people\nhave been in Australia for up to 60 000 years, then megafauna must have co-existed with\nhumans for at least 30 000 years. Regularly hunted modern kangaroos survived not only\n10 000 years of Aboriginal hunting, but also an onslaught of commercial shooters.\nG\nThe group of scientists led by A.J. Stuart focused on northern Eurasia, which he was taking\nas Europe, plus Siberia, essentially, where they’ve got the best data that animals became\nextinct in Europe during the Late Pleistocene. Some cold-adapted animals, go through into\nthe last part of the cold stage and then become extinct up there. So you’ve actually got two\nphases of extinction. Now, neither of these coincide – these are Neanderthals here being\nreplaced by modern humans. There’s no obvious coincidence between the arrival of\nhumans or climatic change alone and these extinctions. There’s a climatic change here, so\nthere’s a double effect here. Again, as animals come through to the last part of the cold\nstage, here there’s a fundamental change in the climate, reorganization of vegetation, and\nthe combination of the climatic change and the presence of humans – of advanced\nPaleolithic humans – causes this wave of extinction. There’s a profound difference between\nthe North American data and that of Europe, which summarize that the extinctions in\nnorthern Eurasia, in Europe, are moderate and staggered, and in North America severe\nand sudden. And these things relate to the differences in the timing of human arrival. The\nextinction follows from human predation, but only at times of fundamental changes in the\nenvironment.\n \n2",
