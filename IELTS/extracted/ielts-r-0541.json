  "passage_text": "Reading Practice\n \nThe return of monkey life\n \nRain forest trees growing anew on Central American farmland are helping scientists find\nways for monkey and agriculture to benefit one another.\n \n \nA.    Hacienda La Pacifica, a remote working cattle ranch in Guanacaste province of\nnorthern Costa Rica, has for decades been home to a community of mantled howler\nmonkeys. Other native primates- white-faced capuchin monkeys and spider monkeys were\nonce common in this area, too, but vanished after the Pan-American Highway was built\nnearby in the 1950s and most of the surrounding land was cleared for cattle-raising. At\nHacienda La Pacifica, however, an enlightened ranch owner chose to leave some strips of\nnative trees growing. He used these as windbreaks to protect both cattle and their food\ncrops from dry-season winds. In the process, the farmer unwittingly founded a unique\nlaboratory for the study of monkeys.\n \nB.   Ken Glander, a primatologist from Duke University in the USA, is studying La Pacifica’s\nmonkeys in an effort to understand the relationship between howlers and regenerating\nforests at the edges of grazing lands. Studying such disturbed woodlands is increasingly\nimportant because throughout much of the New World Tropics, these are the only forests\nleft. In the 18th century, tropical dry forests once covered most of Central America, but by\nthe 1980s less than two percent remained undisturbed, and less than one percent was\nprotected.\n \nC.     Howlers persists at La Pacifica, Glander explains, because they are leaf-eaters. They\neat fruit when it is available but, unlike capuchin and spider monkeys, do not depend on\nlarge areas of fruiting trees. Glander is particularly interested in howlers’ ability to thrive on\nleaves loaded with toxins- poisonous substances designed to protect the plants. For leaf-\neaters, long-term exposure to a specific plant toxin can increase their ability to neutralize\nthe poisonous substances and absorb the leaf nutrients. Watching generations of howlers\nat La Pacifica has shown Glander that the monkeys keep their systems primed by sampling\na variety of plants and then focusing on a small number of the most nutritious food items.\nThe leaves that grow in regenerating forests, like those at La Pacifica, are actually more\nhowler-friendly than those produced by the centuries-old trees that survive farther south. In\nyounger forests, trees put most of their limited energy into growing wood, leaves, and fruit,\nso they produce much lower levels of toxin than do well-established, old-growth trees.\nD.   The value of maturing forests to primates is also a subject of study at Santa Rosa\nNational Park, about 35 miles northwest of La Pacifica. Large areas of Santa Rosa’s\nforests had at one time been burnt to make space for cattle ranching and coffee farming,\nthereby devastating local monkey habitat. But in 1971 the government protected the area\nby designating it a National Park, and species of Indigenous Lees which had been absent\n \n1\n\n \n \nfor decades began to invade the abandoned pastures. Capuchins were the first to begin\nusing the reborn forests, followed by howlers. Eventually, even spider monkeys, fruit-eaters\nthat need large areas of continuous forest, returned. In the first 28 years following\nprotection of the area, the capuchin population doubled, while the number of howlers\nincreased sevenfold.\n \nE.    Some of the same traits that allow howlers to survive at La Pacifica also explain their\npopulation boom in Santa Rosa, Howler reproduction is faster than that of other native\nmonkey species. They give birth for the first time at about 3.5 years of age, compared with\nseven years for capuchins, and eight or more for spider monkeys. Also, while a female\nspider monkey will have a baby about once every four years, well-fed howlers can produce\nan infant every two years. Another factor is diet. Howlers are very adaptable feeders, and\nonly need a comparatively small home range. Spider monkeys, on the other hand, need to\noccupy a huge home range. Also crucial is fact that the leaves howlers eat hold plenty of\nwater, so the monkeys can survive away from open streams and water holes. This ability\ngives them a real advantage over capuchin and spider monkeys, which have suffered\nduring the long, ongoing drought in the area.\n \nF.   Alejandro Estrada, an ecologist at Estacion de Biologia Los Tuxtlas in Veracruz,\nMexico, has been studying the ecology of a group of howler monkeys that thrive in a\nhabitat totally altered by humans: a cacao plantation in Tabasco state, Mexico. Cacao\nplants need shade to grow, so 40 years ago the owners of Cholula Cacao Farm planted\nfigs, monkeypod and other tall trees to form a protective canopy over their crop. The\nhowlers moved in about 25 years ago after nearby forests were cut. This strange habitat\nseems to support about as many monkeys as would a same-sized patch of wild forest. The\nhowlers eat the leaves and fruit of the shade trees, leaving the valuable cacao pods alone.\nG.   Estrada believes the monkeys bring underappreciated benefits to such plantations,\ndispersing the seeds of fruits such as fig and other shade trees, and fertilizing the soil.\nSpider monkeys also forage for fruit here, though they need nearby areas of forest to\nsurvive in the long term. He hopes that farmers will begin to see the advantages of\nassociating with wild monkeys, which could include potential ecotourism projects,\n‘Conservation is usually viewed as a conflict between farming practices and the need to\npreserve nature,’ Estrada says. ‘We’re moving away from that vision and beginning to\nconsider ways in which commercial activities may become a tool for the conservation of\nprimates in human-modified landscapes.’\n \n2\n\n \nQUESTIONS 1-4\nReading Passage has seven paragraphs, A-G.\nWhich paragraph contains the following information?\nWrite the correct letter A-G, in boxes 1-4 on your answer sheet.\n \nNB    You may use any letter more than once\n1..................... a reason why newer forests provide howlers with better feeding\nopportunities than older forests\n \n2..................... a reference to a change in farmers’ attitudes towards wildlife\n \n3..................... a description of the means by which howlers select the best available diet\nfor themselves\n4..................... figures relating to the reduction of natural wildlife habitat over a period of\ntime\n \nQUESTIONS 5-8\nComplete the summary below.\nChoose ONE WORD ONLY from the passage for each answer.\nWrite your answers in boxes 5-8 on your answer sheet.\n \n \n \n                                              Why do howlers have an advantage over other\n                                                              Central American monkeys?\n \n-Howler monkeys have a more rapid rate of 5..................... than either capuchin of\nspider monkeys. \n-Unlike the other local monkey species, howlers can survive without eating\n6....................., \n-and so can live inside a relatively small habitat area.
