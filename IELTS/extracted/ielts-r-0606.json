  "passage_text": "Reading Practice\n \nVolatility Kills\nA .  Despite gun battles in the capital of Chad, rioting in Kenya, and Galloping inflation in\nZimbabwe, the economies of sub-Saharan Africa are, as a whole, in better shape than they\nwere a few years ago. The World Bank has reported recently that this part of the continent\nexperienced a respectable growth rate of 5.6 percent in 2006 and a higher rate from 1995\nto 2005 than in previous decades. The bank has given a cautions assessment that the\nregion may have reached a turning point. An overriding question for developmental\neconomists remains whether the upswing will continue so Africans can grow their way out\nof poverty that relegates some 40 percent of the nearly 744 million in that region to living on\nless than a dollar a day. The optimism, when inspected more closely, maybe short-lived\nbecause of the persistence of a devastating pattern of economic volatility that has lingered\nfor decades.\n \nB.  “In reality, African countries grow as fast as Asian countries and other developing\ncountries during the good times, but afterward they see growth collapses,” comments Jorge\nArbache, a senior World Bank economist. “How to prevent collapses may be as important\nas promoting growth.” If these collapses had not occurred, he observes, the level of gross\ndomestic product for each citizen of the 48 nations of sub -Saharan Africa would have been\nthird higher.\nC . the prerequisites to prevent the next crash are not in place, according to a World Bank\nstudy issued in January, Is Africa’s Recent Growth Robust? The growth period that began\nin 1995, driven by a commodities boom spurred in particular by demand from China, may\nnot be sustainable, because the economic fundamentals- new investment and the ability to\nstave off inflation, among other factors-are absent. The region lacks the necessary\ninfrastructure that would encourage investors to look to Africa to find the next Bengaluru (\nBangalore ) or Shenzhen, a November report from the bank concludes. For sub–Saharan\ncountries rich in oil and other resources, a boom period may even undermine efforts to\ninstitute sound economic practices.. From 1996 to 2005, with growth accelerating,\nmeasures of governance– factors such as political stability, rule of law, and control of\ncorruption- actually worsened, especially for countries endowed with abundant mineral\nresources, the January report notes.                                \n          \nD . Perhaps the most incisive analysis of the volatility question comes from Paul Collier, a\nlongtime specialist in African economics at the University of Oxford and author of the recent\nbook The Bottom Billion. He advocates a range of options that the U.S. and other nations\ncould adopt when formulating policy toward African countries. They include revamped trade\nmeasures, better-apportioned aid, and sustained military intervention in certain instances,\nto avert what he sees as a rapidly accelerating divergence of the world’s poorest, primarily\nin Africa, from the rest of the world, even other developing nations such India and China.   \nE. Collier finds that bad governance is the main reason countries fail to take advantage of\nthe revenue bonanza that results from a boom. moreover, a democratic government, he\nadds, often makes the aftermath of a boom worse. “Instead of democracy disciplining\ngovernments to manage these resource booms well, what happens is that the resource\nrevenues corrupt the normal functioning of democracy-unless you stop ( them from)\n \n1\n\n \ncorrupting the normal function of democracy with sufficient checks and balances”, he said\nat a talk ion January at the Carnegie Council in New York City.\n \nF. Collier advocates that African nations institute an array of standards and codes to bolster\ngovernments, one of which would substitute auctions for bribes in apportioning mineral\nrights and another of which would tax export revenues adequately. He cites the Democratic\nRepublic of the Congo, which took in $ 200 million from mineral exports in 2006 yet\ncollected only $86000 in royalties for its treasury. “If a nation gets these points right, ” he\nargues, “It’s going to develop. If it gets them wrong, it won’t.” \nG . To encourage reform, Collier recommends that the G8 nations agree to accept these\nmeasures as voluntary guidelines for multinationals doing business in Africa- companies,\nfor instance, would only enter new contracts through auctions monitored by an international\nverification group. Such an agreement would follow the examples of the so-called\nKimberley Process, which has effectively undercut the trade in blood diamonds, and the\nExtractive Industries Transparency Initiative, in which a government must report to its\ncitizens the revenues it receives from sales of natural resources.\nH . These measures, he says, are more important than elevating aid levels, an approach\nemphasized by economist Jeffrey D. Sachs of Columbia University and celebrity activists\nsuch as Bono. Collier insists that first Angola receives tens of billions of dollars in oil\nrevenue and whether it gets a few hundred million more or less in aid is really second-\norder.\n \n2",
