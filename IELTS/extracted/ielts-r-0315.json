But one of the most common times to celebrate the New Year is by the\nGregorian calendar. People also call this way of measuring days, months and years the\nWestern or Christian calendar. On this calendar, the first day of the new year is January 1.\nPeople call this holiday “New Year’s Day”.\nPeople love to celebrate New Year’s Day. Some celebrate with parties and music. They\nmay sing traditional songs about old times and good friends. Some people celebrate quietly\nwith family and friends. Other people go to church on New Year’s Day. People may ask\neach other, and God, for forgiveness for the wrong things that happened the year before.\nPeople can leave their mistakes in the old year. Instead, they look to the future. They think\nabout how they can make the new year better, or different, than the year before.\nOne common way people try to make a new beginning is by making New Year’s\nresolutions. A New Year’s resolution is a promise you make to yourself. It usually means a\nchange of behavior or a new goal. \nPeople believe that the first New Year’s resolutions were made thousands of years ago by\nthe Babylonians. The most popular New Year’s resolution for the ancient Babylonians was\nto return borrowed farm equipment! Today, the most popular New Year’s resolutions are\nusually ways for people to improve themselves. People promise to do things like stop\nsmoking or pay back money that they owe. People also commonly make resolutions about\nrelationships and health.\nOn the first day of the New Year people feel great about the changes they hope to make.\nBut what happens after some time has passed? Experts say that most people do not keep\ntheir resolutions for very long. There are many reasons why people often do not keep their\nresolutions. The main reason is that it is difficult to make changes. But there are a few\nways to make it easier to make good changes. \nBe realistic and detailed. Many people make a goal that is too big or not clear. Your\nresolution may be to learn English better. But you may not know how to make that happen!\nInstead, make a resolution that is smaller and more detailed. Making smaller goals will help\nyou to get better at the exact thing you want to do. It will also make you able to measure\nyour success. And that will be encouraging!\nGet as much support as you can. Ask other people to help you remember your resolutions.\nWhen you make a promise to someone else, it is easy to remember. It will also make you\nwant to keep your resolution. Some people make resolutions with someone else. For\nexample, if you wanted to exercise more, you could plan to exercise with a friend. Then you\ncan encourage each other and have fun too. Even if you have no one to help you keep\nyour resolution, there are websites on the internet that offer help. One website sends\nencouraging information about your resolution, such as information about exercising. The\nwebsite will even send emails to help you remember your resolution.\nStart one new healthy habit to replace every unhealthy one. Many people make New\nYear’s resolutions to stop bad habits. These habits may be things like eating unhealthy\nfood, or playing too many video games. It is difficult just to stop a habit. Instead, replace it\n \n1\n\nwith something else. For example, instead of eating unhealthy food snacks, plan healthy\nthings to eat. Make a resolution to eat more fruits and vegetables. Or, in the case of video\ngames, replace the habit with something healthier. Make a resolution to get more exercise.\nAt the times you would play a video game, play a sport with your friends instead.\nHowever, sometimes a bad habit is not just a habit. Sometimes a bad habit is really an\naddiction. Substances like cigarettes or alcohol can cause dependence. A person’s mind or\nbody depends on these substances. For example, when you stop using cigarettes, you\nmay feel sick. You will want the cigarettes very badly. Stopping an addiction is much more\ndifficult than stopping a bad habit. If you are stopping an addiction, look for more help. Visit\nour website for more ideas.\nIt is also good to remember that no one is perfect. Even if we fail one day, we can keep\nworking on our resolutions. People may forget their New Year’s resolutions or want to give\nup. But everyone can remember these helpful ideas: Make detailed goals and get help from\nfriends. Start new good habits as you stop old bad ones. Remind yourself and others that\nyou are not alone. And with perseverance, good changes can last throughout the whole\nyear.\n \n2",
