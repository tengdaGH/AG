  "passage_text": "Reading Practice\n \nFun for the Masses\n \nAmericans worry that the distribution of income is increasingly unequal. Examining\nleisure spending, changes that picture\n \nA Are you better off than you used to be? Even after six years of sustained\neconomic growth, Americans worry about that question. Economists who plumb\ngovernment income statistics agree that Americans’ incomes, as measured in\ninflation-adjusted dollars, have risen more slowly in the past two decades than in\nearlier times, and that some workers’ real incomes have actually fallen. They also\nagree that by almost any measure, income is distributed less equally than it used to\nbe. Neither of those claims, however, sheds much light on whether living standards\nare rising or falling. This is because ‘living standard’ is a highly amorphous concept.\nMeasuring how much people earn is relatively easy, at least compared with\nmeasuring how well they live.\n \nB A recent paper by Dora Costa, an economist at the Massachusetts Institute of\nTechnology, looks at the living-standards debate from an unusual direction. Rather\nthan worrying about cash incomes, Ms Costa investigates Americans’ recreational\nhabits over the past century. She finds that people of all income levels have steadily\nincreased the amount of time and money they devote to having fun. The distribution\nof dollar incomes may have become more skewed in recent years, but leisure is\nmore evenly spread than ever.\n \nC Ms Costa bases her research on consumption surveys dating back as far as 1888.\nThe industrial workers surveyed in that year spent, on average, three-quarters of\ntheir incomes on food, shelter and clothing. Less than 2% of the average family’s\nincome was spent on leisure but that average hid large disparities. The share of a\nfamily’s budget that was spent on having fun rose sharply with its income: the\nlowest-income families in this working-class sample spent barely 1% of their\nbudgets on recreation, while higher earners spent more than 3%. Only the latter\ngroup could afford such extravagances as theatre and concert performances, which\nwere relatively much more expensive than they are today.\n \nD Since those days, leisure has steadily become less of a luxury. By 1991, the\naverage household needed to devote only 38% of its income to the basic\nnecessities, and was able to spend 6% on recreation. Moreover, Ms Costa finds that\nthe share of the family budget spent on leisure now rises much less sharply with\nincome than it used to. At the beginning of this century a family’s recreational\nspending tended to rise by 20% for every 10% rise in income. By 1972-73, a 10%\nincome gain led to roughly a 15% rise in recreational spending, and the increase fell\nto only 13% in 1991. What this implies is that Americans of all income levels are now\nable to spend much more of their money on having fun.\nE One obvious cause is that real income overall has risen. If Americans in general\nare richer, their consumption of entertainment goods is less likely to be affected by\nchanges in their income. But Ms Costa reckons that rising incomes are responsible\nfor, at most, half of the changing structure of leisure spending. Much of the rest may\nbe due to the fact that poorer Americans have more time off than they used to. In\nearlier years, low-wage workers faced extremely long hours and enjoyed few days\n \n1\n\n \noff. But since the 1940s, the less skilled (and lower paid) have worked ever-fewer\nhours, giving them more time to enjoy leisure pursuits.\n \nF Conveniently, Americans have had an increasing number of recreational\npossibilities to choose from. Public investment in sports complexes, parks and golf\ncourses has made leisure cheaper and more accessible. So too has technological\ninnovation. Where listening to music used to imply paying for concert tickets or\nowning a piano, the invention of the radio made music accessible to everyone and\nvirtually free. Compact discs, videos and other paraphernalia have widened the\nchoice even further.\n \nG At a time when many economists are pointing accusing fingers at technology for\ncausing a widening inequality in the wages of skilled and unskilled workers, Ms\nCosta’s research gives it a much more egalitarian face. High earners have always\nbeen able to afford amusement. By lowering the price of entertainment, technology\nhas improved the standard of living of those in the lower end of the income\ndistribution. The implication of her results is that once recreation is taken into\naccount, the differences in Americans’ living standards may not have widened so\nmuch after all.\n \nH These findings are not water-tight. Ms Costa’s results depend heavily upon what\nexactly is classed as a recreational expenditure. Reading is an example. This was\nthe most popular leisure activity for working men in 1888, accounting for one-quarter\nof all recreational spending. In 1991, reading took only 16% of the entertainment dollar.\nBut the American Department of Labour’s expenditure surveys do not distinguish between\nthe purchase of a mathematics tome and that of a best-selling novel. Both are classified as\nrecreational expenses. If more money is being spent on textbooks and professional books\nnow than in earlier years, this could make ‘recreational’ spending appear stronger than it\nreally is.\nI Although Ms Costa tries to address this problem by showing that her results still\nhold even when tricky categories, such as books, are removed from the sample, the\ndifficulty is not entirely eliminated. Nonetheless, her broad conclusion seems fair.\nRecreation is more available to all and less dependent on income. On this measure\nat least, inequality of living standards has fallen.\n \n2",
