  "passage_text": "Reading Practice\n \nSOSUS: Listening to the Ocean\n \nA The oceans of Earth cover more than 70 percent of the planet’s surface, yet, until quite\nrecently, we knew less about their depths than we did about the surface of the Moon.\nDistant as it is, the Moon has been far more accessible to study because astronomers long\nhave been able to look at its surface, first with the naked eye and then with the telescope-\nboth instruments that focus light. And, with telescopes tuned to different wavelengths of\nlight, modem astronomers can not only analyze Earth’s atmosphere, but also determine the\ntemperature and composition of the Sun or other stars many hundreds of light-years away.\nUntil the twentieth century, however, no analogous instruments were available for the study\nof Earth’s oceans: Light, which can travel trillions of miles through the vast vacuum of\nspace, cannot penetrate very far in seawater.\nB Curious investigators long have been fascinated by sound and the way it travels in water.\nAs early as 1490, Leonardo da Vinci observed: “If you cause your ship to stop and place\nthe head of a long tube in the water and place the outer extremity to your ear, you will hear\nships at a great distance from you.” In 1687, the first mathematical theory of sound\npropagation was published by Sir Isaac Newton in his Philosophiae Naturalis Principia\nMathematica, Investigators were measuring the speed of sound in air beginning in the mid\nseventeenth century, but it was not until 1826 that Daniel Colladon, a Swiss physicist, and\nCharles Sturm, a French mathematician, accurately measured its speed in water. Using a\nlong tube to listen underwater (as da Vinci had suggested), they recorded how fast the\nsound of a submerged bell traveled across Lake Geneva. Their result-1,435 meters (1,569\nyards) per second in water of 1.8 degrees Celsius (35 degrees Fahrenheit)- was only 3\nmeters per second off from the speed accepted today. What these investigators\ndemonstrated was that water – whether fresh or salt- is an excellent medium for sound,\ntransmitting it almost five times faster than its speed in air\nC In 1877 and 1878the British scientist John William Strutt, third Baron Rayleigh, published\nhis two-volume seminal work, The Theory of Sound, often regarded as marking the\nbeginning of the modem study of acoustics. The recipient of the Nobel Prize for Physics in\n1904 for his successful isolation of the element argon, Lord Rayleigh made key discoveries\nin the fields of acoustics and optics that are critical to the theory of wave propagation in\nfluids. Among other things, Lord Rayleigh was the first to describe a sound wave as a\nmathematical equation (the basis of all theoretical work on acoustics) and the first to\ndescribe how small particles in the atmosphere scatter certain wavelengths of sunlight, a\nprinciple that also applies to the behavior of sound waves in water.\nD A number of factors influence how far sound travels underwater and how long it lasts.\nFor one, particles in seawater can reflect, scatter, and absorb certain frequencies of sound\n– just as certain wavelengths of light may be reflected, scattered, and absorbed by specific\ntypes of particles in the atmosphere. Seawater absorbs 30 times the amount of sound\nabsorbed by distilled water, with specific chemicals (such as magnesium sulfate and boric\nacid) damping out certain frequencies of sound. Researchers also learned that low\nfrequency sounds, whose long wavelengths generally pass over tiny particles, tend to\ntravel farther without loss through absorption or scattering. Further work on the effects of\nsalinity, temperature, and pressure on the speed of sound has yielded fascinating insights\ninto the structure of the ocean. Speaking generally, the ocean is divided into horizontal\n \n1\n\nlayers in which sound speed is influenced more greatly by temperature in the upper regions\nand by pressure in the lower depths. At the surface is a sun-warmed upper layer, the actual\ntemperature and thickness of which varies with the season. At mid-latitudes, this layer\ntends to be isothermal, that is the temperature tends to be uniform throughout the layer\nbecause the water is well mixed by the action of waves, winds, and convection currents; a\nsound signal moving down through this layer tends to travel at an almost constant speed.\nNext comes a transitional layer called the thermocline, in which temperature drops steadily\nwith depth; as temperature falls, so does the speed of sound.\nE The U.S. Navy was quick to appreciate the usefulness of low-frequency sound and the\ndeep sound channel in extending the range at which it could detect submarines. In great\nsecrecy during the 1950sthe U.S. Navy launched a project that went by the code name\nJezebel; it would later come to be known as the Sound Surveillance System (SOSUS). The\nsystem involved arrays of underwater microphones, called hydrophones, that were placed\non the ocean bottom and connected by cables to onshore processing centers. With\nSOSUS deployed in both deep and shallow waters along both coasts of North America and\nthe British West Indies, the U.S. Navy not only could detect submarines in much of the\nnorthern hemisphere, it also could distinguish how many propellers a submarine had,\nwhether it was conventional or nuclear, and sometimes even the class of sub.\nF The realization that SOSUS could be used to listen to whales also was made by\nChristopher Clark, a biological acoustician at Cornell University, when he first visited a\nSOSUS station in 1992. When Clark looked at the graphic representations of sound,\nscrolling 24 hours day, every day, he saw the voice patterns of blue, finback, minke, and\nhumpback whales. He also could hear the sounds. Using a SOSUS receiver in the West\nIndies, he could hear whales that were 1,770 kilometers (1,100 miles) away. Whales are\nthe biggest of Earth’s creatures. The blue whale, for example, can be 100 feet long and\nweigh as many tons. Yet these animals also are remarkably elusive. Scientists wish to\nobserve blue time and position them on a map. Moreover, they can track not just one whale\nat a time, but many creatures simultaneously throughout the North Atlantic and the eastern\nNorth Pacific. They also can learn to distinguish whale calls. For example, Fox and\ncolleagues have detected changes in the calls of finback whales during different seasons\nand have found that blue whales in different regions of the Pacific ocean have different\ncalls. Whales firsthand must wait in their ships for the whales to surface. A few whales\nhave been tracked briefly in the wild this way but not for very great distances, and much\nabout them remains unknown. Using the SOSUS stations, scientists can track the whales\nin real time and position them on a map. Moreover, they can track not just one whale at a\ntime, but many creatures simultaneously throughout the North Atlantic and the eastern\nNorth Pacific. They also can learn to distinguish whale calls. For example, Fox and\ncolleagues have detected changes in the calls of finback whales during different seasons\nand have found that blue whales in different regions of the Pacific Ocean have different\ncalls.\nG SOSUS, with its vast reach, also has proved instrumental in obtaining information crucial\nto our understanding of Earth’s weather and climate. Specifically, the system has enabled\nresearchers to begin making ocean temperature measurements on a global scale –\nmeasurements that are keys to puzzling out the workings of heat transfer between the\nocean and the atmosphere. The ocean plays an enormous role in determining air\ntemperature the heat capacity in only the upper few meters of ocean is thought to be equal\nto all of the heat in the entire atmosphere. For sound waves traveling horizontally in the\nocean, speed is largely a function of temperature. Thus, the travel time of a wave of sound\n \n2\n\nbetween two points is a sensitive indicator of the average temperature along its path.\nTransmitting sound in numerous directions through the deep sound channel can give\nscientists measurements spanning vast areas of the globe. Thousands of sound paths in\nthe ocean could be pieced together into a map of global ocean temperatures and, by\nrepeating measurements along the same paths over times, scientists could track changes\nin temperature over months or years.\nH Researchers also are using other acoustic techniques to monitor climate.\nOceanographer Jeff Nystuen at the University of Washington, for example, has explored\nthe use of sound to measure rainfall over the ocean. Monitoring changing global rainfall\npatterns undoubtedly will contribute to understanding major climate change as well as the\nweather phenomenon known as El Nino. Since 1985, Nystuen has used hydrophones to\nlisten to rain over the ocean, acoustically measuring not only the rainfall rate but also the\nrainfall type, from drizzle to thunderstorms. By using the sound of rain underwater as a\n“natural” rain gauge, the measurement of rainfall over the oceans will become available to\nclimatologists.\n \n3",
