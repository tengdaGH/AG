  "passage_text": "Reading Practice\n \nTool for ancient writing\n{A} With time, the record-keepers developed systematized symbols from their drawings.\nThese symbols represented words and sentences but were easier and faster to draw and\nuniversally recognized for meaning. The discovery of clay made portable records possible\n(you can’t carry a cave wall around with you). Early merchants used clay tokens with\npictographs to record the quantities of materials traded or shipped. These tokens date back\nto about 8,500 B.C. With the high volume and the repetition inherent in record keeping,\npictographs evolved and slowly lost their picture detail. They became abstract figures\nrepresenting sounds in spoken communication. The alphabet replaced pictographs\nbetween 1700 and 1500 B.C. in the Sinaitic world. The current Hebrew alphabet and\nwriting became popular around 600 B.C. About 400 B.C. the Greek alphabet was\ndeveloped. Greek was the first script written from left to right. From Greek followed the\nByzantine and the Roman (later Latin) writings. In the beginning, all writing systems had\nonly uppercase letters, when the writing instruments were refined enough for detailed\nfaces, lowercase was used as well (around 600 A.D.)\n \n{B} The earliest means of writing that approached pen and paper as we know them today\nwas developed by the Greeks. They employed a writing stylus, made of metal, bone, or\nivory, to placemarks upon wax-coated tablets. The tablets are made in hinged pairs, closed\nto protect the scribe’s notes. The first examples of handwriting (purely text messages made\nby hand) originated in Greece. The Grecian scholar, Cadmus invented the written letter –\ntext messages on paper sent from one individual to another.\n{C} Writing was advancing beyond chiselling pictures into stone or wedging pictographs\ninto wet clay. The Chinese invented and perfected ‘Indian Ink’. Originally designed for\nblacking the surfaces of raised stone-carved hieroglyphics, the ink was a mixture of soot\nfrom pine smoke and lamp oil mixed with the gelatin of donkey skin and musk. The ink\ninvented by the Chinese philosopher, Tien-Lcheu (2697 B.C.), became common by the\nyear 1200 B.C. Other cultures developed inks using natural dyes and colours derived from\nberries, plants, and minerals. In early writings, different coloured inks had ritual meanings\nattached to each colour. \n{D} The invention of inks paralleled the introduction of the paper. The early Egyptians,\nRomans, Greeks, and Hebrews, used papyrus and parchment papers. One of the oldest\npieces of writing on papyrus known to us today is the Egyptian “Prisse Papyrus” which\ndates back to 2000 B.C. The Romans created a reed-pen perfect for parchment and ink,\nfrom the hollow tubular stems of marsh grasses, especially from the jointed bamboo plant.\nThey converted bamboo stems into a primitive form of a fountain pen. They cut one end\ninto the form of a pen nib or point. A writing fluid or ink filled the stem, squeezing the reed\nforced fluid to the nib\n{E} By 400 A.D. a stable form of ink developed, a composite of iron salts, nutgalls, and\ngum, the basic formula, which was to remain in use for centuries. Its colour when first\napplied to paper was a bluish-black, rapidly turning into a darker black and then over the\nyears fading to the familiar dull brown colour commonly seen in old documents. Wood-fiber\npaper was invented in China in 105 A.D. but it only became known about (due to Chinese\nsecrecy) in Japan around 700 A.D. and was brought to Spain by the Arabs in 711 A.D.\n \n1\n\n \nPaper was not widely used throughout Europe until paper mills were built in the late 14th\ncentury\n{F} The writing instrument that dominated for the longest period in history (over one\nthousand years) was the quill pen. Introduced around 700 A.D., the quill is a pen made\nfrom a bird feather. The strongest quills were those taken from living birds in the spring\nfrom the five outer left wing feathers. The left wing was favoured because the feathers\ncurved outward and away when used by a right-handed writer. Goose feathers were most\ncommon; swan feathers were of a premium grade being scarcer and more expensive. For\nmaking fine lines, crow feathers were the best, and then came the feathers of the eagle,\nowl, hawk, and turkey.\n{G} There were also disadvantages associated with the use of quill pens, including a\nlengthy preparation time. The early European writing parchments made from animal skins\nrequired much scraping and cleaning. A lead and a ruler made margins. To sharpen the\nquill, the writer needed a special knife (origins of the term “pen-knife”.)
