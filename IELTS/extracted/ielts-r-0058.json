  "passage_text": "Reading Practice\n \nBAKELITE - The birth of modem plastics\nIn 1907, Leo Hendrick Baekeland, a Belgian scientist working in New York, discovered and\npatented a revolutionary new synthetic material. His invention, which he named 'Bakelite',\nwas of enormous technological importance, and effectively launched the modern plastics\nindustry.\nThe term 'plastic' comes from the Greek plassein, meaning 'to mould' Some plastics are\nderived from natural sources, some are semi-synthetic (the result of chemical action on a\nnatural substance), and some are entirely synthetic, that is, chemically engineered from the\nconstituents of coal or oil. Some are 'thermoplastic', which means that, like candlewax, they\nmelt when heated and can then be reshaped. Others are 'thermosetting': like eggs, they\ncannot revert to their original viscous state, and their shape is thus fixed for ever Bakelite\nhad the distinction of being the first totally synthetic thermosetting plastic.\nThe history of today's plastics begins with the discovery of a series of semi-synthetic\nthermoplastic materials in the mid-nineteenth century. The impetus behind the\ndevelopment of these early plastics was generated by a number of factors - immense\ntechnological progress in the domain of chemistry, coupled with wider cultural changes,\nand the pragmatic need to find acceptable substitutes for dwindling supplies of 'luxury'\nmaterials such as tortoiseshell and ivory.\nBaekeland's interest in plastics began in 1885 when, as a young chemistry student in\nBelgium, he embarked on research into phenolic resins, the group of sticky substances\nproduced when phenol (carbolic acid) combines with an aldehyde (a volatile fluid similar to\nalcohol). He soon abandoned the subject, however, only returning to it some years later. 8y\n1905 he was a wealthy New Yorker, having recently made his fortune with the invention of\na new photographic paper. While Baekeland had been busily amassing dollars, some\nadvances had been made in the development of plastics. The years 1899 and 1900 had\nseen the patenting of the first semi-synthetic thermosetting material that could be\nmanufactured on an industrial scale. In purely scientific terms, Baekeland's major\ncontribution to the field is not so much the actual discovery of the material to which he gave\nhis name, but rather the method by which a reaction between phenol and formaldehyde\ncould be controlled, thus making possible its preparation on a commercial basis. On 13\nJuly 1907, Baekeland took out his famous patent describing this preparation, the essential\nfeatures of which are still in use today.\nThe original patent outlined a three-stage process, in which phenol and formaldehyde (from\nwood or coal) were initially combined under vacuum inside a large egg-shaped kettle. The\nresult was a resin known as Novalak, which became soluble and malleable when heated.\nThe resin was allowed to cool in shallow trays until it hardened, and then broken up and\nground into powder. Other substances were then introduced: including fillers, such as\nwoodflour, asbestos or cotton, which increase strength and moisture resistance, catalysts\n(substances to speed up the reaction between two chemicals without joining to either) and\nhexa, a compound of ammonia and formaldehyde which supplied the additional\nformaldehyde necessary to form a thermosetting resin. This resin was then left to cool and\nharden, and ground up a second time. The resulting granular powder was raw Bakelite,\nready to be made into a vast range of manufactured objects. In the last stage, the heated\nBakelite was poured into a hollow mould of the required shape and subjected to extreme\n \n1\n\nheat and pressure, thereby 'setting' its form for life.\nThe design of Bakelite objects, everything from earrings to television sets, was governed to\na large extent by the technical requirements of the moulding process. The object could not\nbe designed so that it was locked into the mould and therefore difficult to extract. A\ncommon general rule was that objects should taper towards the deepest part of the mould,\nand if necessary the product was moulded in separate pieces. Moulds had to be carefully\ndesigned so that the molten Bakelite would flow evenly and completely into the mould.\nSharp corners proved impractical and were thus avoided, giving rise to the smooth,\n'streamlined' style popular in the 1930s. The thickness of the walls of the mould was also\ncrucial’ thick walls took longer to cool and harden, a factor which had to be considered by\nthe designer in order to make the most efficient use of machines.\n \nBaekeland's invention, although treated with disdain in its early years, went on to enjoy an\nunparalleled popularity which lasted throughout the first half of the twentieth century. It\nbecame the wonder product of the new world of industrial expansion - 'the material of a\nthousand uses'. Being both non-porous and heat-resistant, Bakelite kitchen goods were\npromoted as being germ-free and sterilisable.
