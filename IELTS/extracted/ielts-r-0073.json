  "passage_text": "Reading Practice\n \nBondi Beach\nA\nBondi Beach, Australia’s most famous beach, is located in the suburb of Bondi, in the Local\nGovernment Area of Waverley, seven kilometers from the centre of Sydney. “Bondi” or\n“Boondi” is an Aboriginal word meaning water breaking over rocks or the sound of breaking\nwaves. The Australian Museum records that Bondi means a place where a flight of nullas\ntook place. There are Aboriginal Rock carving on the northern end of the beach at Ben\nBuckler and south of Bondi Beach near McKenzies Beach on the coastal walk.\nB\nThe indigenous people of the area at the time of European settlement have generally been\nwelcomed to as the Sydney people or the Eora (Eora means “the people”). One theory\ndescribes the Eora as a sub-group of the Darug language group which occupied the\nCumberland Plain west to the Blue Mountains. However, another theory suggests that they\nwere a distinct language group of their own. There is no clear evidence for the name or\nnames of the particular band(s) of the Eora that roamed what is now the Waverley area. A\nnumber of place names within Waverley, most famously Bondi, have been based on words\nderived from Aboriginal languages of the Sydney region.\nC\nFrom the mid-1800s Bondi Beach was a favourite location for family outings and picnics.\nThe beginnings of the suburb go back to 1809, when the early road builder, William\nRoberts, received from Governor Bligh a grant of 81 hectares of what is now most of the\nbusiness and residential area of Bondi Beach. In 1851, Edward Smith Hall and Francis\nO’Brien purchased 200 acres of the Bondi area that embraced almost the whole frontage of\nBondi Beach, and it was named the “The Bondi Estate.” Between 1855 and 1877 O’Brien\npurchased Hall’s share of the land, renamed the land the “O’Brien Estate,” and made the\nbeach and the surrounding land available to the public as a picnic ground and amusement\nresort. As the beach became increasingly popular, O’Brien threatened to stop public beach\naccess. However, the Municipal Council believed that the Government needed to intervene\nto make the beach a public reserve.\nD\nDuring the 1900s beach became associated with health, leisure and democracy – a\nplayground everyone could enjoy equally. Bondi Beach was a working-class suburb\nthroughout most of the twentieth century with migrant people from New Zealand comprising\nthe majority of the local population. The first tramway reached the beach in 1884. Following\nthis, tram became the first public transportation in Bondi. As an alternative, this action\nchanged the rule that only rich people can enjoy the beach. By the 1930s Bondi was\ndrawing not only local visitors but also people from elsewhere in Australia and overseas.\nAdvertising at the time referred to Bondi Beach as the “Playground of the Pacific”.\nE\nThere is a growing trend that people prefer having to relax near seaside instead of living\nunhealthily in cities. The increasing popularity of sea bathing during the late 1800s and\n \n1\n\nearly 1900s raised concerns about public safety and how to prevent people from drowning.\nIn response, the world’s first formally documented surf lifesaving club, the Bondi Surf\nBathers’ Life Saving Club, was formed in 1907. This was powerfully reinforced by the\ndramatic events of “Black Sunday” at Bondi in 1938. Some 35,000 people were on the\nbeach and a large group of lifesavers were about to start a surf race when three freak\nwaves hit the beach, sweeping hundreds of people out to sea. Lifesavers rescued 300\npeople. The largest mass rescue in the history of surf bathing, it confirmed the place of the\nlifesaver in the national imagination.\nF\nBondi Beach is the endpoint of the City to Surf Fun Run which is held each year in August.\nAustralian surf carnivals further instilled this image. A Royal Surf Carnival was held at\nBondi Beach for Queen Elizabeth II during her first visited in Australia in 1954. Since 1867,\nthere have been over fifty visits by a member of the British Royal Family to Australia. In\naddition to many activities, the Bondi Beach Markets is open every Sunday. Many wealthy\npeople spend Christmas Day at the beach. However, the shortage of houses occurs when\nlots of people crushed to the seaside. Manly is the seashore town which solved this\nproblem. However, people still choose Bondi as the satisfied destination rather than Manly.\nG\nBondi Beach has a commercial area along Campbell Parade and adjacent side streets,\nfeaturing many popular cafes, restaurants, and hotels, with views of the contemporary\nbeach. It is depicted as wholly modern and European. In the last decade, Bondi Beaches’\nunique position has seen a dramatic rise in svelte houses and apartments to take\nadvantage of the views and scent of the sea. The valley running down to the beach is the\nfamous world over for its view of distinctive red-tiled roofs. Those architectures are deeply\ninfluenced by British coastal town.\nH\nBondi Beach hosted the beach volleyball competition at the 2000 Summer Olympics. A\ntemporary 10,000-seat stadium, a much smaller stadium, 2 warm-up courts, and 3 training\ncourts were set up to host the tournament. The Bondi Beach Volleyball Stadium was\nconstructed for it and stood for just six weeks. Campaigners oppose both the social and\nenvironmental consequences of the development. The stadium will divide the beach in two\nand seriously restrict public access for swimming, walking, and other forms of outdoor\nrecreation. People protest for their human rights of having a pure seaside and argue for\nhealth life in Bondi.\nI\n“They’re prepared to risk lives and risk the Bondi beach environment for the sake of eight\ndays of volleyball”, said Stephen Uniacke, a construction lawyer involved in the campaign.\nOther environmental concerns include the possibility that soil dredged up from below the\nsand will acidify when brought to the surface.\n \n2",
