  "passage_text": "Reading Practice\n \nThe life and work of Marie Curie\nMarie Curie is probably the most famous woman scientist who has ever lived. Born Maria\nSklodowska in Poland in 1867, she is famous for her work on radioactivity, and was twice a\nwinner of the Nobel Prize. With her husband, Pierre Curie, and Henri Becquerel, she was\nawarded the 1903 Nobel Prize for Physics, and was then sole winner of the 1911\nNobel Prize for Chemistry. She was the first woman to win a Nobel Prize.\nFrom childhood, Marie was remarkable for her prodigious memory, and at the age of 16\nwon a gold medal on completion of her secondary education. Because her father lost his\nsavings through bad investment, she then had to take work as a teacher. From her\nearnings she was able to finance her sister Bronia's medical studies in Paris, on the\nunderstanding that Bronia would, in turn, later help her to get an education.\nIn 1891 this promise was fulfilled and Marie went to Paris and began to study at the\nSorbonne (the University of Paris). She often worked far into the night and lived on little\nmore than bread and butter and tea. She came first in the examination in the physical\nsciences in 1893, and in 1894 was placed second in the examination in mathematical\nsciences. It was not until the spring of that year that she was introduced to Pierre Curie.\nTheir marriage in 1895 marked the start of a partnership that was soon to achieve results of\nworld significance. Following Henri Becquerel's discovery in 1896 of a new phenomenon,\nwhich Marie later called 'radioactivity', Marie Curie decided to find out if the radioactivity\ndiscovered in uranium was to be found in other elements. She discovered that this was true\nfor thorium.\nTurning her attention to minerals, she found her interest drawn to pitchblende, a mineral\nwhose radioactivity, superior to that of pure uranium, could be explained only by the\npresence in the ore of small quantities of an unknown substance of very high activity.\nPierre Curie joined her in the work that she had undertaken to resolve this problem, and\nthat led to the discovery of the new elements, polonium and radium. While Pierre Curie\ndevoted himself chiefly to the physical study of the new radiations, Marie Curie struggled to\nobtain pure radium in the metallic state. This was achieved with the help of the chemist\nAndré-Louis Debierne, one of Pierre Curie's pupils. Based on the results of this research,\nMarie Curie received her Doctorate of Science, and in 1903 Marie and Pierre shared with\nBecquerel the Nobel Prize for Physics for the discovery of radioactivity.\nThe births of Marie's two daughters, Irène and Eve, in 1897 and 1904 failed to interrupt her\nscientific work. She was appointed lecturer in physics at the École Normale Supérieure\nfor girls in Sèvres, France (1900), and introduced a method of teaching based on\nexperimental demonstrations. In December 1904 she was appointed chief assistant in the\nlaboratory directed by Pierre Curie.\nThe sudden death of her husband in 1906 was a bitter blow to Marie Curie, but was also a\nturning point in her career: henceforth she was to devote all her energy to completing\nalone the scientific work that they had undertaken. On May 13, 1906, she was appointed to\nthe professorship that had been left vacant on her husband's death, becoming the first\nwoman to teach at the Sorbonne. In 1911 she was awarded the Nobel Prize for Chemistry\nfor the isolation of a pure form of radium.\n \n1\n\nDuring World War I, Marie Curie, with the help of her daughter Irène, devoted herself to the\ndevelopment of the use of X-radiography, including the mobile units which came to be\nknown as ‘Little Curies', used for the treatment of wounded soldiers. In 1918 the Radium\nInstitute, whose staff Irène had joined, began to operate in earnest, and became a centre\nfor nuclear physics and chemistry. Marie Curie, now at the highest point of her fame and,\nfrom 1922, a member of the Academy of Medicine, researched the chemistry of radioactive\nsubstances and their medical applications.\nIn 1921, accompanied by her two daughters, Marie Curie made a triumphant journey to the\nUnited States to raise funds for research on radium. Women there presented her with a\ngram of radium for her campaign. Marie also gave lectures in Belgium, Brazil, Spain and\nCzechoslovakia and, in addition, had the satisfaction of seeing the development of the\nCurie Foundation in Paris, and the inauguration in 1932 in Warsaw of the Radium Institute,\nwhere her sister Bronia became director.\nOne of Marie Curie's outstanding achievements was to have understood the need to\naccumulate intense radioactive sources, not only to treat illness but also to maintain\nan abundant supply for research. The existence in Paris at the Radium Institute of a stock\nof 1.5 grams of radium made a decisive contribution to the success of the experiments\nundertaken in the years around 1930. This work prepared the way for the discovery of the\nneutron by Sir James Chadwick and, above all, for the discovery in 1934 by Irène and\nFrédéric Joliot-Curie of artificial radioactivity. A few months after this discovery, Marie Curie\ndied as a result of leukaemia caused by exposure to radiation.
