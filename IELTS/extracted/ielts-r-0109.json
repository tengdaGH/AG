But most efforts\nto explain how Martian climate ever permitted such clement conditions come up dry.\nBitterly cold and parched today, Mars needed a potent greenhouse atmosphere to sustain\nits watery past. A thick layer of heat-trapping carbon dioxide from volcanoes probably\nshrouded the young planet, but climate models indicate time and again that C02 alone\ncould not have kept the surface above freezing.\n \nB Now, inspired by the surprising discovery that sulfur minerals are pervasive in the\nMartian soil, scientists are beginning to suspect that C02 had a warm-up partner: sulfur\ndioxide (S02). Like C02, S02 is a common gas emitted when volcanoes erupt, a frequent\noccurrence on Mars when it was still young. A hundredth or even a thousandth of a percent\nS02 in Mars's early atmosphere could have provided the extra boost of greenhouse\nwarming that the Red Planet needed to stay wet, explains geochemist Daniel p. Schrag of\nHarvard University.\n \nC That may not sound like much, but for many gases, even minuscule concentrations are\nhard to maintain. On our home planet, S02 provides no significant long-term warmth\nbecause it combines almost instantly with oxygen in the atmosphere to form sulfate, a type\nof salt. Early Mars would have been virtually free of atmospheric oxygen, though, so S02\nwould have stuck around much longer.\n \nD \"When you take away oxygen, it's a profound change, and the atmosphere works really\ndifferently,\" Schrag remarks. According to Schrag and his colleagues, that difference also\nimplies that S02 would have played a starring role in the Martian water cycle—thus\nresolving another climate conundrum, namely, a lack of certain rocks.\n \nE Schrag's team contends that on early Mars, much of the S02 would have combined with\nairborne water droplets and fallen as sulfurous acid rain, rather than transforming into a salt\nas on Earth. The resulting acidity would have inhibited the formation of thick layers of\nlimestone and other carbonate rocks. Researchers assumed Mars would be chock-full of\ncarbonate rocks because their formation is such a fundamental consequence of the humid,\nC02-rich atmosphere. Over millions of years, this rock-forming process has sequestered\nenough of the carbon dioxide spewed from earthly volcanoes to limit the buildup of the gas\nin the atmosphere. stifling this C02-sequestration step on early Mars would have forced\nmore of the gas to accumulate in the atmosphere—another way S02 could have boosted\ngreenhouse warming, Schrag suggests.\nF Some scientists doubt that S02 was really up to these climatic tasks . Even in an oxygen-\nfree atmosphere, S02 is still extremely fragile; the sun's ultraviolet radiation splits apart S02\nmolecules quite readily, points out James F. Kasting, an atmospheric chemist at\nPennsylvania state University. In Easting's computer models of Earth's early climate, which\nis often compared with that of early Mars, this photochemical destruction capped S02\nconcentrations at one thousandth as much as Schrag and his colleagues describe. \"There\nmay be ways to make this idea work,\" Kasting says. \"But it would take some detailed\nmodeling to convince skeptics, including me, that it is actually feasible.\"\n \n1\n\n \n \nG Schrag admits that the details are uncertain, but he cites estimates by other researchers\nwho suggest that early Martian volcanoes could have spewed enough S02 to keep pace\nwith the S02 destroyed photochemically. Previous findings also indicate that a thick C02\natmosphere would have effectively scattered the most destructive wavelengths of\nultraviolet radiation—yet another example of an apparently mutually beneficial partnership\nbetween C02 and S02 on early Mars.\n \nH Kasting maintains that an S02 climate feedback could not have made early Mars as\nwarm as Earth, but he does allow for the possibility that S02 concentrations may have\nremained high enough to keep the planet partly defrosted, with perhaps enough rainfall to\nform river valleys. Over that point, Schrag does not quibble. \"Our hypothesis doesn't\ndepend at all on whether there was a big ocean, a few lakes or just a few little puddles,\" he\nsays. \" Warm doesn't mean warm like the Amazon. It could mean warm like Iceland— just\nwarm enough to create those river valleys . \" with S02, it only takes a little. If sulfur dioxide\nwarmed early Mars, as a new hypothesis suggests, minerals called sulfites would have\nformed in standing water at the surface. No sulfites have yet turned up, possibly because\nno one was looking for them. The next-generation rover, the Mars Science Laboratory, is\nwell equipped for the search. Scheduled to launch in 2009, the rover (shown here in an\nartist's conception) will be the first to carry an x-ray diffractometer, which can scan and\nidentify the crystal structure of any mineral it encounters.\n \n2",
