  "passage_text": "Reading Practice\n \n \n \nLearning lessons from the past\nMany past societies collapsed or vanished, leaving behind monumental ruins such as those\nthat the poet Shelley imagined in his sonnet, Ozymandias. By collapse, I mean a drastic\ndecrease in human population size and/or political/economic/social complexity, over a\nconsiderable area, for an extended time. By those standards, most people would consider\nthe following past societies to have been famous victims of full-fledged collapses rather\nthan of just minor declines: the Anasazi and Cahokia within the boundaries of the modern\nUS, the Maya cities in Central America, Moche and Tiwanaku societies in South America,\nNorse Greenland, Mycenean Greece and Minoan Crete in Europe, Great Zimbabwe in\nAfrica, Angkor Wat and the Harappan Indus Valley cities in Asia, and Easter Island in the\nPacific Ocean.\nThe monumental ruins left behind by those past societies hold a fascination for all of us.\nWe marvel at them when as children we first learn of them through pictures. When we grow\nup, many of us plan vacations in order to experience them at first hand. We feel drawn to\ntheir often spectacular and haunting beauty, and also to the mysteries that they pose. The\nscales of the ruins testify to the former wealth and power of their builders. Yet these\nbuilders vanished, abandoning the great structures that they had created at such effort.\nHow could a society that was once so mighty end up collapsing?\nIt has long been suspected that many of those mysterious abandonments were at least\npartly triggered by ecological problems: people inadvertently destroying the environmental\nresources on which their societies depended. This suspicion of unintended ecological\nsuicide (ecocide) has been confirmed by discoveries made in recent decades by\narchaeologists, climatologists, historians, paleontologists, and palynologists (pollen\nscientists). The processes through which past societies have undermined themselves by\ndamaging their environments fall into eight categories, whose relative importance differs\nfrom case to case: deforestation and habitat destruction, soil problems, water management\nproblems, overhunting, overfishing, effects of introduced species on native species, human\npopulation growth, and increased impact of people.\nThose past collapses tended to follow somewhat similar courses constituting variations on\na theme. Writers find it tempting to draw analogies between the course of human societies\nand the course of individual human lives - to talk of a society’s birth, growth, peak, old age\nand eventual death. But that metaphor proves erroneous for many past societies: they\ndeclined rapidly after reaching peak numbers and power, and those rapid declines must\nhave come as a surprise and shock to their citizens. Obviously, too, this trajectory is not\none that all past societies followed unvaryingly to completion: different societies collapsed\nto different degrees and in somewhat different ways, while many societies did not collapse\nat all.\nToday many people feel that environmental problems overshadow all the other threats to\nglobal civilisation. These environmental problems include the same eight that undermined\npast societies, plus four new ones: human-caused climate change, build up of toxic\nchemicals in the environment, energy shortages, and full human utilisation of the Earth’s\nphotosynthetic capacity. But the seriousness of these current environmental problems is\nvigorously debated. Are the risks greatly exaggerated, or conversely are they\nunderestimated? Will modern technology solve our problems, or is it creating new problems\n \n1\n\nfaster than it solves old ones? When we deplete one resource (e.g. wood, oil, or ocean\nfish), can we count on being able to substitute some new resource (e.g. plastics, wind and\nsolar energy, or farmed fish)? Isn’t the rate of human population growth declining, such that\nwe’re already on course for the world’s population to level off at some manageable number\nof people?\nQuestions like this illustrate why those famous collapses of past civilisations have taken on\nmore meaning than just that of a romantic mystery. Perhaps there are some practical\nlessons that we could learn from all those past collapses. But there are also differences\nbetween the modern world and its problems, and those past societies and their problems.\nWe shouldn't be so naive as to think that study of the past will yield simple solutions,\ndirectly transferable to our societies today. We differ from past societies in some respects\nthat put us at lower risk than them; some of those respects often mentioned include our\npowerful technology (i.e. its beneficial effects), globalisation, modern medicine, and greater\nknowledge of past societies and of distant modern societies. We also differ from past\nsocieties in some respects that put us at greater risk than them: again, our potent\ntechnology (i.e., its unintended destructive effects), globalisation (such that now a problem\nin one part of the world affects all the rest), the dependence of millions of us on modern\nmedicine for our survival, and our much larger human population. Perhaps we can still\nlearn from the past, but only if we think carefully about its lessons.\n \n2",
