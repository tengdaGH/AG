  "passage_text": "Reading Practice\n \nTattoo on Tikopia\n \nA.   There are still debates about the origins of Polynesian culture, but one thing we can\nensure is that Polynesia is not a single tribe but a complex one. Polynesians which include\nMarquesans, Samoans, Niueans, Tongans, Cook Islanders, Hawaiians, Tahitians,\nand Maori, are genetically linked to indigenous peoples of parts of Southeast Asia. It’s a\nsub-region of Oceania, comprising of a large grouping of over 1,000 islands scattered over\nthe central and southern Pacific Ocean, within a triangle that has New Zealand, Hawaii and\nEaster Island as its corners.\n \nB.   Polynesian history has fascinated the western world since Pacific cultures were first\ncontacted by European explorers in the late 18th century. The small island of Tikopia, for\nmany people – even for many Solomon Islanders – is so far away that it seems like a\nmythical land; a place like Narnia, that magical land in C. S. Lewis's classic, ‘The\nChronicles of Narnia.’ Maybe because of it – Tikopia, its people, and their cultures have\nlong fascinated scholars, travelers, and casual observers. Like the pioneers' Peter Dillion,\nDumont D’Urville and John Coleridge Patterson who visit and write about the island in the\n1800s, Raymond Firth is one of those people captured by the alluring attraction of Tikopia.\nAs a result, he had made a number of trips to the island since the 1920s and recorded his\nexperiences, observations, and reflections on Tikopia, its people, cultures and the changes\nthat have occurred.\n \nC.   While engaged in the study of the kinship and religious life of the people of\nTikopia, Firth made a few observations on their tattooing. Brief though these notes are they\nmay be worth putting on record as an indication of the sociological setting of the practice in\nthis primitive Polynesian community. The origin of the English word tattoo’ actually comes\nfrom the Tikopia word ‘tatau’. The word for tattoo marks, in general, is tau, and the\noperation of tattooing is known as ta tau, ta being the generic term for the act of striking.\n \nD.   The technique of tattooing was similar through Polynesia. Traditional tattoo\nartists create their indelible tattoos using pigment made from the candlenut or kukui nut.\nFirst, they burn the nut inside a bowl made of half a coconut shell. They then scrape out the\nsoot and use a pestle to mix it with liquid. Bluing is sometimes added to counteract the\nreddish hue of the carbon-based pigment. It also makes the outline of the inscribed designs\nbolder on the dark skin of tattooing subjects.\nE.   For the instruments used when tattooing, specialists used a range of chisels made from\nalbatross wing bone which were hafted onto a handle which was made from the heart wood\nof the bush and struck with a mallet. The tattooer began by sketching with charcoal a\ndesign on the supine subject, whose skin at that location was stretched taut by one or more\napprentices. The tattooer then dipped the appropriate points – eighter a single one or a\nwhole comb – into the ink (usually contained in a coconut-shell cup) and tapped it into the\nsubject’s skin, holding the blade handle in one hand and tapping it with the other. The\n \n1\n\n \nblood that usually trickled from the punctures was wiped away either by the tattooer or his\napprentice, the latter having also inevitably painful – a test of fortitude that tattooers sought\nto shorten by working as fas as possible. In fact, tattoos nearly always festered and often\nled to sickness – and in some cases death.\n \nF.   In ancient Polynesian society, nearly everyone was tattooed. It was an integral part of\nancient culture and was much more than a body ornament. Tattooing indicated\nones' genealogy and/or rank in society. It was a sign of wealth, of strength and of the ability\nto endure pain. Those who went without them were seen as persons of lower social status.\nAs such, chiefs and warriors generally had the most elaborate tattoos.

The male facial tattoo is generally divided into eight sections of the face. The center of\nthe forehead designated a person’s general rank. The area around the brows designated\nhis position. The area around the eyes and the nose designated his hapu, or sub-tribe rank.\nThe area around the temples served to details his signature. This signature was once\nmemorized by tribal chief's who used it when buying property, signing deeds, and\nofficiating orders. The cheek area designated the nature of the person’s work.
