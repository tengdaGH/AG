  "passage_text": "Reading Practice\n \n \nRadio Automation\nToday they are everywhere. Production lines controlled by computers and operated by\nrobots. There’s no chatter of assembly workers, just the whirr and click of machines. In the\nmid-1940s, the workerless factory was still the stuff of science fiction. There were no\ncomputers to speak of and electronics was primitive. Yet hidden away in the English\ncountryside was a highly automated production line called ECME, which could turn out\n1500 radio receivers a day with almost no help from human hands.\nA. John Sargrove, the visionary engineer who developed the technology, was way ahead\nof his time. For more than a decade, Sargrove had been trying to figure out how to make\ncheaper radios. Automating the manufacturing process would help. But radios didn’t lend\nthemselves to such methods: there were too many parts to fit together and too many wires\nto solder. Even a simple receiver might have 30 separate components and 80 hand-\nsoldered connections. At every stage, things had to be tested and inspected. Making radios\nrequired highly skilled labour—and lots of it.\n \nB. In 1944, Sargrove came up with the answer. His solution was to dispense with most of\nthe fiddly bits by inventing a primitive chip—a slab of Bakelite with all the receiver’s\nelectrical components and connections embedded in it. This was something that could be\nmade by machines, and he designed those too. At the end of the war, Sargrove built an\nautomatic production line, which he called ECME (electronic circuit-making equipment), in\na small factory in Effingham, Surrey.\n \nC. An operator sat at one end of each ECME line, feeding in die plates. She didn’t need\nmuch skill, only quick hands. From now on, everything was controlled by electronic\nswitches and relays. First stop was the sandblaster, which roughened the surface of the\nplastic BO that molten metal would stick to it The plates were then cleaned to remove any\ntraces of grit The machine automatically checked that the surface was rough enough\nbefore sending the plate to the spraying section. There, eight nozzles rotated into position\nand sprayed molten zinc over both sides of the plate. Again, the nozzles only began to\nspray when a plate was in place. The plate whizzed on. The next stop was the milling\nmachine, which ground away the surface layer of metal to leave the circuit and other\ncomponents in the grooves and recesses. Now the plate was a composite of metal and\nplastic. It sped on to be lacquered and have its circuits tested. By the time it emerged from\nthe end of the line, robot hands had fitted it with sockets to attach components such as\nvalves and loudspeakers. When ECME was working flat out; the whole process took 20\nseconds.\nD. ECME was astonishingly advanced. Electronic eyes, photocells that generated a small\ncurrent when a panel arrived, triggered each step in the operation, BO avoiding excessive\nwear and tear on the machinery. The plates were automatically tested at each stage as\nthey moved along the conveyor. And if more than two plates in succession were duds, the\nmachines were automatically adjusted—or if necessary halted In a conventional factory, I\nworkers would test faulty circuits and repair them. But Sargrove’s assembly line produced\ncircuits so cheaply they just threw away the faulty ones. Sargrove’s circuit board was even\nmore astonishing for the time. It predated the more familiar printed circuit, with wiring\n \n1\n\nprinted on aboard, yet was more sophisticated. Its built-in components made it more like a\nmodem chip.\n \nE. When Sargrove unveiled his invention at a meeting of the British Institution of Radio\nEngineers in February 1947, the assembled engineers were impressed. So was the man\nfrom The Times. ECME, he reported the following day, “produces almost without human\nlabour, a complete radio receiving set. This new method of production can be equally well\napplied to television and other forms of electronic apparatus.\nF. The receivers had many advantages over their predecessors, wit components they were\nmore robust. Robots didn’t make the sorts of mistakes human assembly workers\nsometimes did. “Wiring mistakes just cannot happen,” wrote Sargrove. No w  es also meant\nthe radios were lighter and cheaper to ship abroad. And with no soldered wires to come\nunstuck, the radios were more reliable. Sargrove pointed out that the drcuit boards didn’t\nhave to be flat. They could be curved, opening up the prospect of building the electronics\ninto the cabinet of Bakelite radios.\n \nG. Sargrove was all for introducing this type of automation to other products. It could be\nused to make more complex electronic equipment than radios, he argued. And even if only\npart of a manufacturing process were automated, the savings would be substantial. But\nwhile his invention was brilliant, his timing was bad. ECME was too advanced for its own\ngood. It was only competitive on huge production runs because each new job meant\nretooling the machines. But disruption was frequent. Sophisticated as it was, ECME still\ndepended on old- fashioned electromechanical relays and valves—which failed with\nmonotonous regularity. The state of Britain’s economy added to Sargrove’s troubles.\nProduction was dogged by power cuts and post-war shortages of materials. Sargrove’s\nfinancial backers began to get cold feet.\nH. There was another problem Sargrove hadn’t foreseen. One of ECME’s biggest\nadvantages—the savings on the cost of labour—also accelerated its downfall. Sargrove’s\nfactory had two ECME production lines to produce the two c  cuits needed for each radio.\nBetween them these did what a thousand assembly workers would otherwise have done.\nHuman hands were needed only to feed the raw material in at one end and plug the valves\ninto then sockets and fit the loudspeakers at the other. After that, the only job left was to fit\nthe pair of Bakelite panels into a radio cabinet and check that it worked.\nI. Sargrove saw automation as the way to solve post-war labour shortages. With somewhat\nUtopian idealism, he imagined his new technology would free people from boring, repetitive\njobs on the production line and allow them to do more interesting work. “Don’t get the idea\nthat we are out to rob people of then jobs,” he told the Daily Mnror. “Our task is to liberate\nmen and women from being slaves of machines.”\nJ. The workers saw things differently. They viewed automation in the same light as the\neverlasting light bulb or the suit that never wears out—as a threat to people’s livelihoods. If\nautomation spread, they wouldn’t be released to do more exciting jobs. They’d be released\nto join the dole queue. Financial backing for ECME fizzled out. The money dried up.
