  "passage_text": "Reading Practice\n \nFlying tortoises\nAn airborne reintroduction programme has helped conservationists take significant steps to protect the\nendangered Galapagos tortoise.\nA \nForests of spiny cacti cover much of the uneven lava plains that separate the interior of the Galapagos island of\nIsabela from the Pacific Ocean. With its five distinct volcanoes, the island resembles a lunar landscape. Only the\nthick vegetation at the skirt of the often cloud-covered peak of Sierra Negra offers respite from the barren terrain\nbelow.\nThis inhospitable environment is home to the giant Galapagos tortoise. Some time after the Galapagos’s birth,\naround five million years ago, the islands were colonised by one or more tortoises from mainland South\nAmerica. As these ancestral tortoises settled on the individual islands, the different populations adapted to their\nunique environments, giving rise to at least 14 different subspecies. Island life agreed with them. In the absence\nof significant predators, they grew to become the largest and longest-living tortoises on the planet, weighing\nmore than 400 kilograms, occasionally exceeding 1,8 metres in length and living for more than a century.\nB \nBefore human arrival, the archipelago's tortoises numbered in the hundreds of thousands. From the 17th century\nonwards, pirates took a few on board for food, but the arrival of whaling ships in the 1790s saw this exploitation\ngrow exponentially. Relatively immobile and capable of surviving for months without food or water, the tortoises\nwere taken on board these ships to act as food supplies during long ocean passages. Sometimes, their bodies\nwere processed into high- grade oil.\nIn total, an estimated 200,000 animals were taken from the archipelago before the 20th century. This historical\nexploitation was then exacerbated when settlers came to the islands. They hunted the tortoises and destroyed\ntheir habitat to clear land for agriculture. They also introduced alien species - ranging from cattle, pigs, goats,\nrats and dogs to plants and ants - that either prey on the eggs and young tortoises or damage or destroy their\nhabitat.\nC\nToday, only 11 of the original subspecies survive and of these, several are highly endangered. In 1989, work\nbegan on a tortoise-breeding centre just outside the town of Puerto Villamil on Isabela, dedicated to protecting\nthe island’s tortoise populations. The centre’s captive-breeding programme proved to be extremely successful,\nand it eventually had to deal with an overpopulation problem.\n \nD\nThe problem was also a pressing one. Captive-bred tortoises can’t be reintroduced into the wild until they’re at\nleast five years old and weigh at least 4,5 kilograms, at which point their size and weight - and their hardened\nshells - are sufficient to protect them from predators. But if people wait too long after that point, the tortoises\neventually become too large to transport.\nE\nFor years, repatriation efforts were carried out in small numbers, with the tortoises carried on the backs of men\nover weeks of long, treacherous hikes along narrow trails. But in November 2010, the environmentalist and\nGalapagos National Park liaison officer Godfrey Merlin, a visiting private motor yacht captain and a helicopter\npilot gathered around a table in a small cafe in Puerto Ayora on the island of Santa Cruz to work out more\nambitious reintroduction. The aim was to use a helicopter to move 300 of the breeding centre’s tortoises to\n \n1\n\nvarious locations close to Sierra Negra.\nF\nThis unprecedented effort was made possible by the owners of the 67-metre yacht White Cloud, who provided\nthe Galapagos National Park with free use of their helicopter and its experienced pilot, as well as the logistical\nsupport of the yacht, its captain and crew. Originally an air ambulance, the yacht’s helicopter has a rear double\ndoor and a large internal space that’s well suited for cargo, so a custom crate was designed to hold up to 33\ntortoises with a total weight of about 150 kilograms. This weight, together with that of the fuel, pilot and four\ncrew, approached the helicopter’s maximum payload, and there were times when it was clearly right on the edge\nof the helicopter’s capabilities.
