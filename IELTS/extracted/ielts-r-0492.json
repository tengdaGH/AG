  "passage_text": "Reading Practice\n \nThe History Of Salt\nSalt is so simple and plentiful that we almost take it for granted. In chemical terms, salt is\nthe combination of a sodium ion with a chloride ion, making it one of the most basic\nmolecules on earth. It is also one of the most plentiful: it has been estimated that salt\ndeposits under the state of Kansas alone could supply the entire world’s needs for the next\n250,000 years.\nBut salt is also an essential element. Without it, life itself would be impossible since the\nhuman body requires the mineral in order to function properly. The concentration of sodium\nions in the blood is directly related to the regulation of safe body fluid levels. And while we\nare all familiar with its many uses in cooking, we may not be aware that this element is\nused in some 14,000 commercial applications. From manufacturing pulp and paper to\nsetting dyes in textiles and fabric, from producing soaps and detergents to making our\nroads safe in winter, salt plays an essential part in our daily lives.\nSalt has a long and influential role in world history. From the dawn of civilization, it has\nbeen a key factor in economic, religious, social and political development. In every corner\nof the world, it has been the subject of superstition, folklore, and warfare, and has even\nbeen used as currency.\nAs a precious and portable commodity, salt has long been a cornerstone of economies\nthroughout history. In fact, researcher M.R. Bloch conjectured that civilization began along\nthe edges of the desert because of the natural surface deposits of salt found there. Bloch\nalso believed that the first war – likely fought near the ancient city of Essalt on the Jordan\nRiver – could have been fought over the city’s precious supplies of the mineral.\nIn 2200 BC, the Chinese emperor Hsia Yu levied one of the first known taxes. He taxed\nsalt. In Tibet, Marco Polo noted that tiny cakes of salt were pressed with images of the\nGrand Khan to be used as coins and to this day among the nomads of Ethiopia’s Danakil\nPlains it is still used as money. Greek slave traders often bartered it for slaves, giving rise\nto the expression that someone was “not worth his salt.” Roman legionnaires were paid in\nsalt – a solarium, the Latin origin of the word “salary.”\nMerchants in 12th-century Timbuktu – the gateway to the Sahara Desert and the seat of\nscholars – valued this mineral as highly as books and gold. In France, Charles of Anjou\nlevied the “gabelle,” a salt tax, in 1259 to finance his conquest of the Kingdom of Naples.\nOutrage over the gabelle fueled the French Revolution. Though the revolutionaries\neliminated the tax shortly after Louis XVI, the Republic of France re-established the gabelle\nin the early 19th Century; only in 1946 was it removed from the books.\nThe Erie Canal, an engineering marvel that connected the Great Lakes to New York’s\nHudson River in 1825, was called “the ditch that salt built.” Salt tax revenues paid for half\nthe cost of construction of the canal. The British monarchy supported itself with high salt\ntaxes, leading to a bustling black market for the white crystal. In 1 785, the Earl of\nDundonald wrote that every year in England, 10,000 people were arrested for salt\nsmuggling. And protesting against British rule in 1930, Mahatma Gandhi led a 200-mile\nmarch to the Arabian Ocean to collect untaxed salt for India’s poor.\nIn religion and culture, salt long held an important place with Greek worshippers\n \n1\n\nconsecrating it in their rituals. Further, in the Buddhist tradition, salt repels evil spirits, which\nis why it is customary to throw it over your- shoulder before entering your house after a\nfuneral: it scares off any evil spirits that may be clinging to your back. Shinto religion also\nuses it to purify an area. Before sumo wrestlers enter the ring for a match – which is, in\nreality, an elaborate Shinto rite – a handful is thrown into the center to drive off malevolent\nspirits.\nIn the Southwest of the United States, the Pueblo worship the Salt Mother. Other native\ntribes had significant restrictions on who was permitted to eat salt. Hopi legend holds that\nthe angry Warrior Twins punished mankind by placing valuable salt deposits far from\ncivilization, requiring hard work and bravery to harvest the precious mineral. In 1933, the\nDalai Lama was buried sitting up in a bed of salt. Today, a gift of salt endures in India as a\npotent symbol of good luck and a reference to Mahatma Gandhi’s liberation of India.\nThe effects of salt deficiency are highlighted in times of war, when human bodies and\nnational economies are strained to their limits. Thousands of Napoleon’s troops died during\nthe French retreat from Moscow due to inadequate wound healing and lowered resistance\nto disease – the results of salt deficiency.\n \n2",
