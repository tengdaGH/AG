We in South Oxfordshire\nDistrict Council consider that, although Didcot does have potential for further growth, such\ndevelopment should be sustainable, well-planned, and supported by adequate\ninfrastructure and community services.\n \nB\nRecent experience in Didcot has demonstrated that large greenfield [1] developments\ncannot resource all the necessary infrastructure and low-cost housing requirements. The\nensuing compromises create a legacy of local transport, infrastructure and community\nservices deficits, with no obvious means of correction. We wish to ensure that there is\ngreater recognition of the cost attached to housing growth, and that a means is found to\nresource the establishment of sustainable communities in growth areas.\nC\nUntil the 1950s, the development of job opportunities in the railway industry, and in a large,\nmilitary ordnance depot, was the spur to Didcot’s expansion. Development at that time was\ngeared to providing homes for the railway and depot workers, with limited investment in\nshopping and other services for the local population. Didcot failed to develop Broadway as\na compact town centre, and achieved only a strip of shops along one side of the main\nstreet hemmed in by low density housing and service trade uses.\nD\nFrom the 1970s, strategic planning policies directed significant new housing development\nto Didcot. Planners recognised Didcot’s potential, with rapid growth in local job\nopportunities and good rail connections for those choosing to work farther afield. However,\nthe town is bisected by the east-west railway, and people living in Ladygrove, the urban\nextension to the north which has been built since the 1980s, felt, and still feel, cut off from\nthe town and its community.\nE\nPopulation growth in the new housing areas failed to spark adequate private-sector\ninvestment in town centre uses, and the limited investment which did take place - Didcot\nMarket Place development in 1982, for instance - did not succeed in delivering the number\nand range of town centre uses needed by the growing population. In 1990, public-sector\nfinance was used to buy the land required for the Orchard Centre development, comprising\na superstore, parking and a new street of stores running parallel to Broadway. The\ndevelopment took 13 years to complete.\nF\nThe idea that, by obliging developers of new housing to contribute to the cost of\n \n1\n\ninfrastructure and service requirements, all the necessary finance could be raised, has\nproved unachievable. Substantial public finance was still needed to deliver major projects\nsuch as the new link road to the A34 on the outskirts of the town at Milton, the improved\nrailway crossing at Marsh Bridge and new schools. Such projects were delayed due to\ndifficulties in securing public finance. The same problem also held back expansion of health\nand social services in the town.\nG\nIn recent years, government policy, in particular the requirement for developers that forty\npercent of the units in a new housing development should be low cost homes, has had a\nmajor impact on the economics of such development, as it has limited the developers’\ncontribution to the costs of infrastructure. The planning authorities are facing difficult\nchoices in prioritising the items of infrastructure which must be funded by development, and\nthis, in turn, means that from now on public finance will need to provide a greater\nproportion of infrastructure project costs.\nH\nThe Government’s Sustainable Communities Plan seeks a holistic approach to new urban\ndevelopment in which housing, employment, services and infrastructure of all kinds are\ncarefully planned and delivered in a way which avoids the infrastructure deficits that have\noccurred in places like Didcot in the past. This report, therefore, is structured around the\nindividual components of a sustainable community, and shows the baseline position for\neach component.\nI\nDidcot has been identified as one of the towns with which the Government is working to\nevaluate whether additional growth will strengthen the economic potential of the town,\ndeliver the necessary infrastructure and improve environmental standards. A programme of\nwork, including discussions with the local community about their aspirations for the town as\nwell as other stakeholders, will be undertaken over the coming months, and will lead to the\ndevelopment of a strategic master plan.
