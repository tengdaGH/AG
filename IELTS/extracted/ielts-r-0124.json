  "passage_text": "Reading Practice\n \nDelivering The Goods\nThe vast expansion in international trade owes much to a revolution in the business of\nmoving freight \nA\nInternational trade is growing at a startling pace. While the global economy has been\nexpanding at a bit over 3% a year, the volume of trade has been rising at a compound\nannual rate of about twice that. Foreign products, from meat to machinery, play a more\nimportant role in almost every economy in the world, and foreign markets now tempt\nbusinesses that never much worried about sales beyond their nation's borders.\nB\nWhat lies behind this explosion in international commerce? The general worldwide decline\nin trade barriers, such as customs duties and import quotas, is surely one explanation.\nThe economic opening of countries that have traditionally been minor players is another.\nBut one force behind the import-export boom has passed all but unnoticed: the rapidly\nfalling cost of getting goods to market. Theoretically, in the world of trade, shipping costs do\nnot matter. Goods, once they have been made, are assumed to move instantly and at no\ncost from place to place. The real world, however, is full of frictions. Cheap labour may\nmake Chinese clothing competitive in America, but if delays in shipment lie up working\ncapital and cause winter coats to arrive in spring, trade may lose its advantages.\nC\nAt the turn of the 20th century, agriculture and manufacturing were the two most important\nsectors almost everywhere, accounting for about 70% of total output in Germany, Italy\nand France, and 40-50% in America, Britain and Japan. International commerce was\ntherefore dominated by raw materials, such as wheat, wood and iron ore, or processed\ncommodities, such as meat and steel. But these sorts of products are heavy and bulky and\nthe cost of transporting them relatively high.\nD\nCountries still trade disproportionately with their geographic neighbours. Over time,\nhowever, world output has shitted into goods whose worth is unrelated to their size and\nweight. Today, it is finished manufactured products that dominate the flow of trade, and,\nthanks to technological advances such as lightweight components, manufactured goods\nthemselves have tended to become lighter and less bulky. As a result, less transportation is\nrequired for every dollar's worth of imports or exports.\nE\nTo see how this influences trade, consider the business of making disk drives for\ncomputers. Most of the world's disk-drive manufacturing is concentrated in South-east\nAsia. This is possible only because disk drives, while valuable, are small and light and so\ncost little to ship. Computer manufacturers in Japan or Texas will not face hugely bigger\nfreight bills if they import drives from Singapore rather than purchasing them on the\ndomestic market. Distance therefore poses no obstacle to the globalisation of the disk-drive\n \n1\n\nindustry.\nF\nThis is even more true of the fast-growing information industries. Films and compact discs\ncost little to transport, even by aeroplane. Computer software can be 'exported' without\never loading it onto a ship, simply by transmitting it over telephone lines from one country\nto another, so freight rates and cargo-handling schedules become insignificant factors\nin deciding where to make the product. Businesses can locate based on other\nconsiderations, such as the availability of labour, while worrying less about the cost of\ndelivering their output.\nG\nIn many countries deregulation has helped to drive the process along. But, behind the\nscenes, a series of technological innovations known broadly as containerisation and\nintermodal transportation has led to swift productivity improvements in cargo-handling.\nForty years ago, the process of exporting or importing involved a great many stages of\nhandling, which risked portions of the shipment being damaged or stolen along the way.\nThe invention of the container crane made it possible to load and unload containers without\ncapsizing the ship and the adoption of standard container sizes allowed almost any box to\nbe transported on any ship. By 1967, dual-purpose ships, carrying loose cargo in the hold*\nand containers on the deck, were giving way to all-container vessels that moved thousands\nof boxes at a time.\nH\nThe shipping container transformed ocean shipping into a highly efficient, intensely\ncompetitive business. But getting the cargo to and from the dock was a different\nstory. National governments, by and large, kept a much firmer hand on truck and railroad\ntariffs than on charges for ocean freight. This started changing, however, in the mid-1970s,\nwhen America began to deregulate its transportation industry. First airlines, then road\nhauliers and railways, were freed from restrictions on what they could carry, where they\ncould haul it and what price they could charge. Big productivity gains resulted. Between\n1985 and 1996, for example, America's freight railways dramatically reduced their\nemployment, trackage, and their fleets of locomotives - while increasing the amount of\ncargo they hauled. Europe's railways have also shown marked, albeit smaller, productivity\nimprovements.\nI\nIn America the period of huge productivity gains in transportation may be almost over, but\nin most countries the process still has far to go. State ownership of railways and\nairlines, regulation of freight rates and toleration of anti-competitive practices, such\nas cargo-handling monopolies, all keep the cost of shipping unnecessarily high and\ndeter international trade. Bringing these barriers down would help the world’s economies\ngrow even closer.\n* hold: ship's storage area below deck\n \n2",
