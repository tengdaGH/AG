  "passage_text": "Reading Practice\n \nMechanisms of Linguistic Change\nA The changes that have caused the most disagreement are those in pronunciation. We\nhave various sources of evidence for the pronunciations of earlier times, such as the\nspellings, the treatment of words borrowed from other languages or borrowed by them, the\ndescriptions of contemporary grammarians and spelling-reformers, and the modern\npronunciations in all the languages and dialects concerned From the middle of the\nsixteenth century, there are in England writers who attempt to describe the position of the\nspeech-organs for the production of English phonemes, and who invent what are in effect\nsystems of phonetic symbols. These various kinds of evidence, combined with a\nknowledge of the mechanisms of speech-production, can often give us a very good idea of\nthe pronunciation of an earlier age, though absolute certainty is never possible.\nB When we study the pronunciation of a language over any period of a few generations or\nmore, we find there are always large-scale regularities in the changes: for example, over a\ncertain period of time, just about all the long [a:] vowels in a language may change into long\n[e:] vowels, or all the [b] consonants in a certain position (for example at the end of a word)\nmay change into [p] consonants. Such regular changes are often called sound laws. There\nare no universal sound laws (even though sound laws often reflect universal tendencies),\nbut simply particular sound laws for one given language (or dialect) at one given period\nC It is also possible that fashion plays a part in the process of change. It certainly plays a\npart in the spread of change: one person imitates another, and people with the most\nprestige are most likely to be imitated, so that a change that takes place in one social group\nmay be imitated (more or less accurately) by speakers in another group. When a social\ngroup goes up or down in the world, its pronunciation of Russian, which had formerly been\nconsidered desirable, became on the contrary an undesirable kind of accent to have, so\nthat people tried to disguise it. Some of the changes in accepted English pronunciation in\nthe seventeenth and eighteenth centuries have been shown to consist in the replacement\nof one style of pronunciation by another style already existing, and it is likely that such\nsubstitutions were a result of the great social changes of the period: the increased power\nand wealth of the middle classes, and their steady infiltration upwards into the ranks of the\nlanded gentry, probably carried elements of middle-class pronunciation into upper-class\nspeech.\nD A less specific variant of the argument is that the imitation of children is imperfect: they\ncopy their parents’ speech, but never reproduce it exactly. This is true, but it is also true\nthat such deviations from adult speech are usually corrected in later childhood. Perhaps it\nis more significant that even adults show a certain amount of random variation in their\npronunciation of a given phoneme, even if the phonetic context is kept unchanged. This,\nhowever, cannot explain changes in pronunciation unless it can be shown that there is\nsome systematic trend in the failures of imitation: if they are merely random deviations they\nwill cancel one another out and there will be no net change in the language.\nE One such force which is often invoked is the principle of ease, or minimization of effort.\nThe change from fussy to fuzzy would be an example of assimilation, which is a very\ncommon kind of change. Assimilation is the changing of a sound under the influence of a\nneighbouring one. For example, the word scant was once skamt, but the /m/ has been\nchanged to /n/ under the influence of the following /t/. Greater efficiency has hereby been\n \n1\n\nachieved, because /n/ and /t/ are articulated in the same place (with the tip of the tongue\nagainst the teeth-ridge), whereas /m/ is articulated elsewhere (with the two lips). So the\nplace of articulation of the nasal consonant has been changed to conform with that of the\nfollowing plosive. A more recent example of the same kind of thing is the common\npronunciation of football as football.\nF Assimilation is not the only way in which we change our pronunciation in order to\nincrease efficiency. It is very common for consonants to be lost at the end of a word: in\nMiddle English, word-final [-n] was often lost in unstressed syllables, so that baken ‘to bake’\nchanged from [‘ba:kan] to [‘ba:k3],and later to [ba:k]. Consonant-clusters are often\nsimplified. At one time there was a [t] in words like castle and Christmas, and an initial [k] in\nwords like knight and know. Sometimes a whole syllable is dropped out when two\nsuccessive syllables begin with the same consonant (haplology): a recent example is\ntemporary, which in Britain is often pronounced as if it were tempory.\n \n2",
