  "passage_text": "Reading Practice\n \nMemory and Age\n{A} Aging, it is now clear, is part of an ongoing maturation process that all our organs go\nthrough. “In a sense, aging is keyed to the level of vigor of the body and the continuous\ninteraction between levels of body activity and levels of mental activity,” reports Arnold B.\nScheibel, M.D., whose very academic title reflects how once far-flung domains now\nconverge on the mind and the brain. Scheibel is professor of anatomy, cell biology,\npsychiatry, and behavioral sciences at the University of California at Los Angeles, and\ndirector of the university’s Brain Research Institute. Experimental evidence has backed up\npopular assumptions that the aging mind undergoes decay analogous to that of the aging\nbody. Younger monkeys, chimps, and lower animals consistently outperform their older\ncolleagues on memory tests. In humans, psychologists concluded, memory and other\nmental functions deteriorate over time because of inevitable organic changes in the brain\nas neurons die off. Mental decline after young adulthood appeared inevitable.\n{B} Equipped with imaging techniques that capture the brain in action, Stanley Rapoport,\nPh.D., at the National Institutes of Health, measured the flow of blood in the brains of old\nand young people as they went through the task of matching photos of faces. Since blood\nflow reflects neuronal activity, Rapoport could compare which networks of neurons were\nbeing used by different subjects. “Even when the reaction times of older and younger\nsubjects were the same, the neural networks they used were significantly different. The\nolder subjects were using different internal strategies to accomplish the same result in the\nsame time,” Rapoport says. Either the task required greater effort on the part of the older\nsubjects or the work of neurons originally involved in tasks of that type had been taken over\nby other neurons, creating different networks.\n{C} At the Georgia Institute of Technology, psychologist Timothy Salthouse, Ph.D.,\ncompared a group of very fast and accurate typists of college age with another group in\ntheir 60s. Since reaction time is faster in younger people and most people’s fingers grow\nless nimble with age, younger typists might be expected to tap right along while the older\nones fumble. But both typed 60 words a minute. The older typists, it turned out, achieved\ntheir speed with cunning little strategies that made them far more efficient than their\nyounger counterparts: They made fewer finger movements, saving a fraction of a second\nhere and there. They also read ahead in the text. The neural networks involved in typing\nappear to have been reshaped to compensate for losses in motor skills or other age\nchanges.\n{D} “When a rat is kept in isolation without playmates or objects to interact with, the\nanimal’s brain shrinks, but if we put that rat with 11 other rats in a large cage and give them\nan assortment of wheels, ladders, and other toys, we can show–after four days– significant\ndifferences in its brain,” says Diamond, professor of integrative biology. Proliferating\ndendrites first appear in the visual association areas. After a month in the enriched\nenvironment, the whole cerebral cortex has expanded, as has its blood supply. Even in the\nenriched environment, rats get bored unless the toys are varied. “Animals are just like we\nare. They need stimulation,” says Diamond.\n{E} One of the most profoundly important mental functions is memory-notorious for its\nfailure with age. So important is memory that the Charles A. Dana Foundation recently\nspent $8.4 million to set up a consortium of leading medical centers to measure memory\n \n1\n\nloss and aging through brain imaging technology, neurochemical experiments, and\ncognitive and psychological tests. One thing, however, is already fairly clear–many aspects\nof memory are not a function of age at all but of education. Memory exists in more than one\nform. What we call knowledge–facts-is what psychologists such as Harry P. Bahrick, Ph.D.,\nof Ohio Wesleyan University calls semantic memory. Events, conversations, and\noccurrences in time and space, on the other hand, make up episodic or event memory,\nwhich is triggered by cues from the context. If you were around in 1963 you don’t need to\nbe reminded of the circumstances surrounding the moment you heard that JFK had been\nassassinated. That event is etched into your episodic memory.\n{F} When you forget a less vivid item, like buying a roll of paper towels at the supermarket,\nyou may blame it on your aging memory. It’s true that episodic memory begins to decline\nwhen most people are in their 50s, but it’s never perfect at any age. “Every memory begins\nas an event,” says Bahrick. “Through repetition, certain events leave behind a residue of\nknowledge, or semantic memory. On a specific day in the past, somebody taught you that\ntwo and two are four, but you’ve been over that information so often you don’t remember\nwhere you learned it. What started as an episodic memory has become a permanent part\nof your knowledge base.” You remember the content, not the context. Our language\nknowledge, our knowledge of the world and of people, is largely that permanent or\nsemipermanent residue.\n{G} Probing the longevity of knowledge, Bahrick tested 1,000 high school graduates to see\nhow well they recalled their algebra. Some had completed the course as recently as a\nmonth before, others as long as 50 years earlier. He also determined how long each\nperson had studied algebra, the grade received, and how much the skill was used over the\ncourse of adulthood. Surprisingly, a person’s grasp of algebra at the time of testing did not\ndepend on how long ago he’d taken the course–the determining factor was the duration of\ninstruction. Those who had spent only a few months learning algebra forgot most of it\nwithin two or three years.\n{H} In another study, Bahrick discovered that people who had taken several courses in\nSpanish, spread out over a couple of years, could recall, decades later, 60 percent or more\nof the vocabulary they learned. Those who took just one course retained only a trace after\nthree years. “This long-term residue of knowledge remains stable over the decades,\nindependent of the age of the person and the age of the memory. No serious deficit\nappears until people get to their 50s and 60s, probably due to the degenerative processes\nof aging rather than a cognitive loss.”\n{I} “You could say metamemory is a byproduct of going to school,” says psychologist\nRobert Kail, Ph.D., of Purdue University, who studies children from birth to 20 years, the\ntime of life when mental development is most rapid. “The question-and-answer process,\nespecially exam-taking, helps children learn–and also teaches them how their memory\nworks This may be one reason why, according to a broad range of studies in people over\n60, the better educated a person is, the more likely they are to perform better in life and on\npsychological tests. A group of adult novice chess players were compared with a group of\nchild experts at the game. In tests of their ability to remember a random series of numbers,\nthe adults, as expected, outscored the children. But when asked to remember the patterns\nof chess pieces arranged on a board, the children won. “Because they’d played a lot of\nchess, their knowledge of chess was better organized than that of the adults, and their\nexisting knowledge of chess served as a framework for new memory,” explains Kail.\n \n2\n\n{J} Specialized knowledge is a mental resource that only improves with time.

When you\napply yourself to a specific interest–say, cooking–you build increasingly elaborate\nknowledge structures that let you do more and do it better. This ability, which is tied to\nexperience, is the essence of expertise. Vocabulary is one such specialized form of\naccrued knowledge. Research clearly shows that vocabulary improves with time. Retired\nprofessionals, especially teachers and journalists, consistently score higher on tests of\nvocabulary and general information than college students, who are supposed to be in their\nmental prime.\n \n3",
