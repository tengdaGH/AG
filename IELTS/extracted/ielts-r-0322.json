  "passage_text": "Reading Practice\n \nOlive Oil Production\nOlive oil has been one of the staples of the Mediterranean diet for thousands of years and\nits popularity is growing rapidly in other parts of the world. It is one of the most versatile oils\nfor cooking and it enhances the taste of many foods. Olive oil is the only type of\nvegetable/fruit oil that can be obtained from just pressing. Most other types of popular oils\n(corn, canola, etc.) must be processed in other ways to obtain the oil. Another important\nbonus is that olive oil has proven health benefits. Three basic grades of olive oil are most\noften available to the consumer: extra Virgin, Virgin and Olive Oil. In addition to the basic\ngrades, olive oil differs from one country or region to another because of the types of olives\nthat are grown, the harvesting methods, the time of the harvest, and the pressing\ntechniques. These factors all contribute to the individual characteristics of the olive oil.\nOlive trees must be properly cared for in order to achieve good economic yields. Care\nincludes regular irrigation, pruning, fertilizing, and killing pests. Olives will survive on very\npoor sites with shallow soils but will grow very slowly and yield poorly. Deep soils tend to\nproduce excessively vigorous trees, also with lower yields. The ideal site for olive oil\nproduction is a clay loam soil with good internal and surface drainage. Irrigation is\nnecessary to produce heavy crops and avoid alternate bearing. The site must be free of\nhard winter frosts because wood damage will occur at temperatures below 15°F and a\nlengthy spell of freezing weather can ruin any chances for a decent crop. The growing\nseason also must be warm enough so fruits mature before even light fall frosts (usually by\nearly November) because of potential damage to the fruit and oil quality. Fortunately, olive\ntrees are very hardy in hot summer temperatures and they are drought tolerant.\nThe best olive oils hold a certificate by an independent organization that authenticates the\nstone ground and cold pressed extraction process. In this process, olives are first\nharvested by hand at the proper stage of ripeness and maturity. Experts feel that hand\nharvesting, as opposed to mechanical harvesting, eliminates bruising of the fruit which\ncauses tartness and oil acidity. The olives harvested are transferred daily to the mill. This is\nvery important because this daily transfer minimizes the time spent between picking and\npressing. Some extra virgin olive oil producers are known to transfer the olives by multi-ton\ntrucks over long distances that expose the fragile fruit to crushing weight and the hot sun,\nwhich causes the olives to begin oxidizing and thus becoming acidic. In addition to the time\nlapse between harvesting and pressing, olive oil must be obtained using mechanical\nprocesses only to be considered virgin or extra virgin. If heat and/or chemical processes\nare used to produce the olive oil or if the time lapse is too long, it cannot be called virgin or\nextra virgin.\nOnce at the mill, the leaves are sucked away with air fans and the olives are washed with\ncirculating potable water to remove all impurities. The first step of extraction is mashing the\nolives to create a paste. The oil, comprising 20% to 30% of the olive, is nestled in pockets\nwithin the fruit’s cells. The olives are crushed in a mill with two granite millstones rolling\nwithin a metal basin. Crushing and mixing the olives releases the oil from the cells of the\nolive without heating the paste. A side shutter on the mill’s basin allows the mixed olive\npaste to be discharged and applied to round mats. The mats are stacked and placed under\n \n1\n\nthe head of a hydraulic press frame that applies downward pressure and extracts the oil.\nThe first pressing yields the superior quality oil, and the second and third pressings\nproduce inferior quality oil. Some single estate producers collect the oil that results from\njust the initial crushing while many other producers use an additional step to extract more\noil. The olive pulp is placed on mats constructed with hemp or polypropylene that are\nstacked and then pressed to squeeze the pulp. Oil and water filter through the mats to a\ncollection tank below. The water and oil are then separated in a centrifuge.\nRegardless of the method used for the first pressing, the temperature of the oil during\nproduction is extremely important in order to maintain the distinct characteristics of the oil.\nIf the temperature of the oil climbs above 86ºF, it will be damaged and cannot be\nconsidered cold-pressed.\nThe first pressing oil contains the most “polyphenols”, substances that have been found to\nbe powerful antioxidants capable of protecting against certain types of disease. The\npolyphenols are not the only substances in the olive with health-promoting effects, but they\nare quite unique when compared to other commonly used culinary oils such as sunflower\nand soy. It is these polyphenols that really set extra virgin olive oils apart from any other oil\nand any other form of olive oil. The more refined the olive oil is, the smaller the quantity of\npolyphenols.\nThe result of the producers’ efforts is a cold pressed extra virgin olive oil with high quality\nstandards and organoleptic characteristics, which give the oil its health-protective and\naromatic properties.\n \n2\n\nQUESTIONS 1-4\nChoose the correct letters A, B, C or D.\nWrite the correct letters in boxes 28 – 31 on your answer sheet.\n1.
