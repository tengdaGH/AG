Three generations ago, 180 young women wrote essays describing why they wanted to\njoin a convent (a religious community of nuns). Years later, a team of psychological\nresearchers came across these autobiographies in the convent’s archives. The researchers\nwere seeking material to confirm earlier studies hinting at a link between having a good\nvocabulary in youth and a low risk of Alzheimer’s disease in old age. What they found was\neven more amazing.  The researchers found that, although the young women were in their\nearly twenties when they wrote their essays, the emotions expressed in these writings were\npredictive of how long they would live: those with upbeat autobiographies lived more than\nten years longer than those whose language was more neutral. Deborah Danner, a\npsychologist at the University of Kentucky who spearheaded the study, noted that the\nresults were particularly striking because all members of the convent lived similar lifestyles,\neliminating many variables that normally make it difficult to interpret longevity studies. It\nwas a phenomenal finding’, she says. ‘A researcher gets a finding like that maybe once in a\nlifetime.’ However, she points out that no one has been able to determine why positive\nemotions might have such life-extending effects.\n \nB.   Barbara Fredrickson, Professor of Psychology at the University of Michigan, believes\nthat part of the answer is the ‘undo effect’. According to this theory, positive emotions help\nyou live longer by shutting down the effects of negative ones. Fredrickson’s theory begins\nwith the observation that negative emotions, like fear and stress, enhance our flight-or-fight\nresponse to very real threats. However, even when the emergency is gone, negative\nemotions produce lingering effects. Brooks Gump, a stress researcher at the State\nUniversity of New York, explains that one of these effects is excessive cardiovascular\nreactivity. Behaviourally, Gump says, this reactivity is related to excessive vigilance: the\nstate of being constantly on guard for potential dangers. Not only is it physically draining to\nlive in a perpetual state of high vigilance, but high cardiovascular reactivity could be linked\nto increased chances of a heart attack.\n \nC.    Fredrickson believes positive emotions work their magic by producing a rapid\nunwinding of pent-up tension, restoring the system to normal. People who quickly bounce\nback from stress often speed the process by harnessing such emotions as amusement,\ninterest, excitement, and happiness, she says. To test her theory, Fredrickson told a group\nof student volunteers that they had only a few minutes to prepare a speech that would be\ncritiqued by experts. After letting the students get nervous about that, Fredrickson then told\nthem they wouldn’t actually have to deliver their speeches. She monitored heart rates and\nblood pressure. Not surprisingly, all students got nervous about their speeches, but those\nwho viewed the experiment with good-humored excitement saw their heart rates return to\nnormal much more quickly than those who were angry about being fooled. In a second\nexperiment, Fredrickson reported that even those who normally were slow to bounce back\ncould be coached to recover more quickly by being told to view the experiment as a\nchallenge, rather than a threat.\n \n1\n\n \nD.    Fredrickson believes that positive emotions make people more flexible and creative.\nNegative emotions, she says, give a heightened sense of detail that makes us\nhypersensitive to minute clues related to the source of a threat. But that also produces\n‘tunnel vision’ in which we ignore anything unrelated to the danger. Fredrickson speculated\nthat just as positive emotions can undo the cardiovascular effects of negative ones, they\nmay also reverse the attention-narrowing effects of negative feelings: broadening our\nperspectives.\n \nE.    To verify her theory, Fredrickson showed a group of students some film clips- some\nsaw frightening clips, some saw humorous ones or peaceful ones. They then did a\nmatching test in which they were shown a simple drawing and asked which of two other\ndrawings it most resembled. The drawings were designed so that people would tend to give\none answer if they focused on details, and another answer if they focused on the big\npicture. The results confirmed Fredrickson’s suspicion that positive emotions affect our\nperceptions. Students who had seen the humorous or peaceful clips were more likely to\nmatch objects according to broad impressions.\n \nF.   This fits with the role that positive emotions might have played in early human tribes,\nFredrickson says. Negative emotions provided focus, which was important for surviving in\nlife-or-death situations, but the ability to feel positive emotions was of long-term value\nbecause it opened the mind to new ideas. Humour is a good example of this. She says:\n‘The emotions are transient, but the resources are durable. If you building a friendship\nthrough being playful, that friendship is a lasting resource.’ So while the good feelings may\npass, the friendship remains. On an individual level, Fredrickson’s theory also says that\ntaking time to do things that make you feel happy isn’t simply self-indulgent. Not only are\nthese emotions good for the individual, but they are also good for society.\nG.  Other researchers are intrigued by Fredrickson’s findings. Susan Folkman, of the\nUniversity of California, has spent two decades studying how people cope with long-term\nstresses such as bereavement, or caring for a chronically ill child. Contrary to what one\nmight expect, she says, these people frequently experience positive emotions. ‘These\nemotions aren’t there by accident’, she adds. ‘Mother Nature doesn’t work that way, I think\nthat they give a person time out from the intense stress to restore their resources and keep\ngoing. This is very consistent with Fredrickson’s work.’\n \n2\n\n \nQUESTIONS 1-6\nReading Passage has seven sections, A-G.\nWhich section contains the following information?\nWrite the correct letter, A-G, in boxes 1-6 on your answer sheet.\nNB    You may use any letter more than once.\n1.....................  a conclusion that it is possible to train people to deal with anxiety\nconclusive evidence that lifespan can be influenced by emotions.\n2.....................  an explanation of the way negative emotions affect what people\nconcentrate on\n3.....................  an experiment that showed how a positive outlook can help people adjust\nto\n4.....................  a stressful situation faster than others\n5.....................  a discovery beyond what researchers were investigating\n6.....................  an experiment where the nature of a material seen by participants affected\nthe way they performed a task\n \nQUESTIONS 7-10\nook at the following statements (Questions 7-10) and the list of researchers below.\nMatch each statement with the correct researcher, A-D.\nWrite the correct letter, A-D, in boxes 7-10 on your answer sheet.\n \nNB    You may use any letter more than once.\n                   \n                   List of Researchers\n                  \nA       Deborah Danner\n                   \n                   \n B       Barbara Fredrickson\nC       Brooks Gump\nD       Susan Folkman\n7.....................
