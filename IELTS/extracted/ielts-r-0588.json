  "passage_text": "Reading Practice\n \nTraditional Farming System in Africa\nA. By tradition land in Luapula is not owned by individuals, but as in many other parts of\nAfrica is allocated by the headman or headwoman of a village to people of either sex,\naccording to need. Since land is generally prepared by hand, one ulupwa cannot take on a\nvery large area; in this sense land has not been a limiting resource over large parts of the\nprovince. The situation has already changed near the main townships, and there has long\nbeen a scarcity of land for cultivation in the Valley. In these areas registered ownership\npatterns are becoming prevalent.\n \nB. Most of the traditional cropping in Luapula, as in the Bemba area to the east, is based\non citemene, a system whereby crops are grown on the ashes of tree branches. As a rule,\nentire trees are not felled, but are pollarded so that they can regenerate. Branches are cut\nover an area of varying size early in the dry season, and stacked to dry over a rough circle\nabout a fifth to a tenth of the pollarded area. The wood is fired before the rains and in the\nfirst year planted with the African cereal finger millet (Eleusine coracana).\nC. During the second season, and possibly for a few seasons more the area is planted to\nvariously mixed combinations of annuals such as maize, pumpkins (Telfiria occidentalis)\nand other cucurbits, sweet potatoes, groundnuts, Phaseolus beans and various leafy\nvegetables, grown with a certain amount of rotation. The diverse sequence ends with\nvegetable cassava, which is often planted into the developing last-but-one crop as a relay.\nD. Richards (1969) observed that the practice of citemene entails a definite division of\nlabour between men and women. A man stakes out a plot in an unobtrusive manner, since\nit is considered provocative towards one’s neighbours to mark boundaries in an explicit\nway. The dangerous work of felling branches is the men’s province, and involves much\npride. Branches are stacke by the women, and fired by the men. Formerly women and men\ncooperated in the planting work, but the harvesting was always done by the women. At the\nbeginning of the cycle little weeding is necessary, since the firing of the branches\neffectively destroys weeds. As the cycle progresses weeds increase and nutrients\neventually become depleted to a point where further effort with annual crops is judged to be\nnot worthwhile: at this point the cassava is planted, since it can produce a crop on nearly\nexhausted soil. Thereafter the plot is abandoned, and a new area pollarded for the next\ncitemene cycle.\n \nE. When forest is not available – this is increasingly the case nowadays – various ridging\nsystems (ibala) are built on small areas, to be planted with combinations of maize, beans,\ngroundnuts and sweet potatoes, usually relayed with cassava. These plots are usually\ntended by women, and provide subsistence. Where their roots have year-round access to\nwater tables mango, guava and oil-palm trees often grow around houses, forming a\ntraditional agroforestry system. In season some of the fruit is sold by the roadside or in\nlocal markets.\nF. The margins of dambos are sometimes planted to local varieties of rice during the rainy\nseason, and areas adjacent to vegetables irrigated with water from the dambo during the\ndry season. The extent of cultivation is very limited, no doubt because the growing of crops\n \n1\n\nunder dambo conditions calls for a great deal of skill. Near towns some of the vegetable\nproduce is sold in local markets.\n \nG. Fishing has long provided a much needed protein supplement to the diet of Luapulans,\nas well as being the one substantial source of cash. Much fish is dried for sale to areas\naway from the main waterways. The Mweru and Bangweulu Lake Basins are the main\nareas of year-round fishing, but the Luapula River is also exploited during the latter part of\nthe dry season. Several previously abundant and desirable species, such as the Luapula\nsalmon or mpumbu (Labeo altivelis) and pale (Sarotherodon machochir) have all but\ndisappeared from Lake Mweru, apparently due to mismanagement.\nH. Fishing has always been a far more remunerative activity in Luapula that crop\nhusbandry. A fisherman may earn more in a week than a bean or maize grower in a whole\nseason. I sometimes heard claims that the relatively high earnings to be obtained from\nfishing induced an ‘easy come, easy go’ outlook among Luapulan men. On the other hand,\nsomeone who secures good but erratic earnings may feel that their investment in an\neconomically productive activity is not worthwhile because Luapulans fail to cooperate well\nin such activities. Besides, a fisherman with spare cash will find little in the way of working\nequipment to spend his money on. Better spend one’s money in the bars and have a good\ntime!\nI. Only small numbers of cattle or oxen are kept in the province owing to the prevalence of\nthe tse-tse fly. For the few herds, the dambos provide subsistence grazing during the dry\nseason. The absence of animal draft power greatly limits peoples’ ability to plough and\ncultivate land: a married couple can rarely manage to prepare by hand-hoeing. Most people\nkeep freely roaming chickens and goats. These act as a reserve for bartering, but may also\nbe occasionally slaughtered for ceremonies or for entertaining important visitors. These\nanimals are not a regular part of most peoples’ diet.\nJ. Citemene has been an ingenious system for providing people with seasonal production\nof high quality cereals and vegetables in regions of acid, heavily leached soils. Nutritionally,\nthe most serious deficiency was that of protein. This could at times be alleviated when fish\nwas available, provided that cultivators lived near the Valley and could find the means of\nbartering for dried fish. The citemene/fishing system was well adapted to the ecology of the\nmiombo regions and sustainable for long periods, but only as long as human population\ndensities stayed at low levels. Although population densities are still much lower than in\nseveral countries of South-East Asia, neither the fisheries nor the forests and woodlands of\nLuapula are capable, with unmodified traditional practices, of supporting the people in a\nsustainable manner.\nOverall, people must learn to intensify and diversify their productive systems while yet\nensuring that these systems will remain productive in the future, when even more people\nwill need food. Increasing overall production offood, though a vast challenge in itself, will\nnot be enough, however. At the same time storage and distribution systems must allow\neveryone access to at least a moderate share of the total.\n \n2",
