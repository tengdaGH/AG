  "passage_text": "Reading Practice\n \nGlow-worms\nA\nThe glow-worm belongs to a family of beetles known as the Lampyridae or fireflies. The\nfireflies are a huge group containing over 2000 species, with new ones being discovered all\nthe time. The feature which makes fireflies and glow-worms so appealing is their ability to\nproduce an often dazzling display of light. The light is used by the adult fireflies as a signal\nto attract a mate, and each species must develop its own 'call-sign' to avoid being confused\nwith other species glowing nearby. So within any one area each species will differ from its\nneighbours in some way, for example in the colour or pattern of its light, how long the\npulses of light last, the interval between pulses and whether it displays in flight or from the\nground.\nB\nThe firefly’s almost magical light has attracted human attention for generations. It is\ndescribed in an ancient Chinese encyclopaedia written over 2000 years ago by a pupil of\nConfucius. Fireflies often featured in Japanese and Arabian folk medicine. All over the\nworld they have been the inspiration for countless poems, paintings and stories. In Britain,\nfor example, there are plenty of anecdotes describing how glow-worms have been used to\nread by or used as emergency bicycle lamps when a cyclist's batteries have failed without\nwarning. Early travellers in the New World came back with similar stories, of how the native\npeople of Central America would collect a type of click beetle and release them indoors to\nlight up their huts. Girls threaded them around their feet to illuminate the forest paths at\nnight.\nFireflies very similar to those we see today have been found fossilised in rocks which were\nformed about 30 million years ago, and their ancestors were probably glowing long before\nthen. It is impossible to be sure exactly when and where the first firefly appeared. The\nhighest concentrations of firefly species today are to be found in the tropics of South\nAmerica, which may mean either that this is where they first evolved, or simply that they\nprefer the conditions there.\nWherever they first arose, fireflies have since spread to almost every part of the globe.\nToday members of the firefly family can be found almost anywhere outside the Arctic and\nAntarctic circles.\nC\nAs with many insects, the glow-worm's life is divided into four distinct stages: the egg, the\nlarva (equivalent to the caterpillar of a butterfly), the pupa (or chrysalis) and the adult. The\nglow-worm begins its life in the autumn as a pale yellow egg. The freshly laid egg is\nextremely fragile but within a day its surface has hardened into a shell. The egg usually\ntakes about 35 days to hatch, but the exact time varies according to the temperature, from\nabout 27 days in hot weather to more than 45 days in cold weather. By the time it is due to\nhatch, the glow-worm's light organ is fully developed, and its glow signals that the egg will\nsoon hatch.\nAfter it has left the egg, the larva slowly grows from a few millimetres into the size and\nshape of a matchstick. The larval stage is the only time the insect can feed. The larva\ndevotes much of its life to feeding and building up its food reserves so that as an adult it will\n \n1\n\nbe free to concentrate all its efforts on the task of finding a mate and reproducing.\nThroughout its time as a larva, approximately 15 months, the glow-worm emits a bright\nlight. The larva's light is much fainter than the adult female's but it can still be seen more\nthan five metres away.\nIn the final stage of a glow-worm's life, the larva encases itself in a pupa) skin while it\nchanges from the simple larva to the more complex adult fly. When the adult fly emerges\nfrom the pupa the male seeks a female with whom it can mate. After mating, the female\nlays about 120 eggs. The adult flies have no mouth parts, cannot eat and therefore only\nlive a few days. When people talk of seeing a glow-worm they normally mean the brightly\nglowing adult female.\nD\nIn some countries the numbers of glow-worms have been falling. Evidence suggests that\nthere has been a steady decrease in the British glow-worm population since the 1950s and\npossibly before that. Possible causes for the decline include habitat destruction, pollution\nand changes in climate. Thousands of acres of grassland have been built upon and glow-\nworm sites have become increasingly isolated from each other. The widespread use of\npesticides and fertilisers may also have endangered the glow-worm. Being at the top of a\nfood chain it is likely to absorb any pollutants eaten by the snails on which it feeds. The\neffect of global warming on rainfall and other weather patterns may also be playing a part in\nthe disappearance of glow-worms. A lot more research will be needed, however, before the\ncauses of the glow-worm's gradual decline are clear.\nE\nAlthough glow-worms are found wherever conditions are damp, food is in good supply and\nthere is an over-hanging wall, they are most spectacular in caves. For more than 100 years\nthe glow-worm caves in New Zealand have attracted millions of people from all over the\nworld. The caves were first explored in 1887 by a local Maori chief, Tane Tinorau, and an\nEnglish surveyor, Fred Mace. They built a raft and, with candles as their only light, they\nfloated into the cave where the stream goes underground. As their eyes adjusted to the\ndarkness they saw myriad lights reflecting off the water. Looking up they discovered that\nthe ceiling was dotted with the lights of thousands of glow-worms. They returned many\ntimes to explore further, and on an independent trip Tane discovered the upper level of the\ncave and an easier access. The authorities were advised and government surveyors\nmapped the caves. By 1888 Tane Tinorau had opened the cave to tourists.\n \n2",
