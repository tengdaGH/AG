But he insists that cases are few and far between. ‘It's a\nvery rare phenomenon.' he says.\nOthers disagree. 'On average I see about one or two buildings a month suffering from\nnickel sulphide related failures,' says Barrie Josie, a consultant engineer involved in the\nBishops Walk investigation. Other experts tell of similar experiences. Tony Wilmott of\nLondon based consulting engineers Sandberg, and Simon Armstrong at CladTech\nAssociates in Hampshire both say they know of hundreds of cases. 'What you hear is only\nthe tip of the iceberg.' says Trevor Ford, a glass expert at Resolve Engineering in Brisbane.\nQueensland. He believes the reason is simple: 'No-one wants bad press.'\nToughened glass is found everywhere, from cars and bus shelters to the windows, walls\nand roofs of thousands of buildings around the world. It's easy to see why. This glass has\nfive times the strength of standard glass, and when it does break it shatters into tiny cubes\nrather than large, razor-sharp shards. Architects love it because large panels can be bolted\ntogether to make transparent walls, and turning it into ceilings and floors is almost as easy.\nIt is made by heating a sheet of ordinary glass to about 620°C to soften it slightly, allowing\nits structure to expand, and then cooling it rapidly with jets of cold air. This causes the outer\nlayer of the pane to contract and solidify before the interior. When the interior finally\nsolidifies and shrinks, it exerts a pull on the outer layer that leaves It in permanent\ncompression and produces a tensile force inside the glass. As cracks propagate best in\nmaterials under tension, the compressive force on the surface must be overcome before\nthe pane will break, making it more resistant to cracking.\nThe problem starts when glass contains nickel sulphide impurities. Trace amounts of nickel\nand sulphur are usually present in the raw materials used to make glass, and nickel can\nalso be introduced by fragments of nickel alloys falling into the molten glass. As the glass is\nheated, these atoms react to form tiny crystals of nickel sulphide. Just a tenth of a gram of\nnickel in the furnace can create up to 50,000 crystals.\nThese crystals can exist in two forms: a dense form called the alpha phase, which is stable\nat high temperatures, and a less dense form called the beta phase, which is stable at room\ntemperatures. The high temperatures used in the toughening process convert all the\ncrystals to the dense, compact alpha form. But the subsequent cooling is so rapid that the\ncrystals don't have time to change back to the beta phase. This leaves unstable alpha\ncrystals in the glass, primed like a coiled spring, ready to revert to the beta phase without\nwarning.\n \n1\n\nWhen this happens, the crystals expand by up to 4%. And if they are within the central,\ntensile region of the pane, the stresses this unleashes can shatter the whole sheet. The\ntime that elapses before failure occurs is unpredictable. It could happen just months after\nmanufacture, or decades later, although if the glass is heated - by sunlight, for example -\nthe process is speeded up. Ironically, says Graham Dodd, of consulting engineers Arup in\nLondon, the oldest pane of toughened glass known to have failed due to nickel sulphide\ninclusions was in Pilkington's glass research building in Lathom, Lancashire. The pane was\n27 years old.\nData showing the scale of the nickel sulphide problem Is almost Impossible to find. The\npicture is made more complicated by the fact that these crystals occur in batches. So even\nif, on average, there is only one inclusion in 7 tonnes of glass, if you experience one nickel\nsulphide failure in your building, that probably means you've got a problem in more than\none pane. Josie says that in the last decade he has worked on over 15 buildings with the\nnumber of failures into double figures.\nOne of the worst examples of this is Waterfront Place, which was completed in 1990. Over\nthe following decade the 40- storey Brisbane block suffered a rash of failures. Eighty panes\nof its toughened glass shattered due to inclusions before experts were finally called in.\nJohn Barry, an expert in nickel sulphide contamination at the University of Queensland,\nanalysed every glass pane in the building. Using a studio camera, a photographer went up\nin a cradle to take photos of every pane. These were scanned under a modified microfiche\nreader for signs of nickel sulphide crystals. ‘We discovered at least another 120 panes with\npotentially dangerous inclusions which were then replaced,’ says Barry. ‘It was a very\nexpensive and time consuming process that took around six months to complete.'\nThough the project cost A$1.6 million (nearly £700,000), the alternative - re-cladding the\nentire building - would have cost ten times as much. \n \n2",
