  "passage_text": "Reading Practice\n \nThe psychology of innovation\nWhy are so few companies truly innovative?\nInnovation is key to business survivaland companies put substantial resources into\ninspiring employees to develop new ideas. There are, nevertheless, people working in\nluxurious, state-of-the-art centres designed to stimulate innovation who find that their\nenvironment doesn’t make them feel at all creative. And there are those who don’t have a\nbudget, or much space, but who innovate successfully.\nFor Robert B. Cialdini, Professor of Psychology at Arizona State University, one reason\nthat companies don’t succeed as often as they should is that innovation starts with\nrecruitment. Research shows that the fit between an employee’s values and a company’s\nvalues makes a difference to what contribution they make and whether, two years after\nthey join, they’re still at the company. Studies at Harvard Business School show that,\nalthough some individuals may be more creative than others, almost every individual can\nbe creative in the right circumstances.\nOne of the most famous photographs in the story of rock’n’roll emphasises Ciaidini’s views.\nThe 1956 picture of singers Elvis Presley, Carl Perkins, Johnny Cash and Jerry Lee Lewis\njamming at a piano in Sun Studios in Memphis tells a hidden story. Sun’s ‘million-dollar\nquartet’ could have been a quintet. Missing from the picture is Roy Orbison’ a greater\nnatural singer than Lewis, Perkins or Cash. Sam Phillips, who owned Sun, wanted to\nrevolutionise popular music with songs that fused black and white music, and country and\nblues. Presley, Cash, Perkins and Lewis instinctively understood Phillips’s ambition and\nbelieved in it. Orbison wasn’t inspired by the goal, and only ever achieved one hit with the\nSun label.\nThe value fit matters, says Cialdini, because innovation is, in part, a process of change,\nand under that pressure we, as a species, behave differently, ‘When things change, we are\nhard-wired to play it safe.’ Managers should therefore adopt an approach that appears\ncounterintuitive -they should explain what stands to be lost if the company fails to seize a\nparticular opportunity. Studies show that we invariably take more gambles when threatened\nwith a loss than when offered a reward.\nManaging innovation is a delicate art. It’s easy for a company to be pulled in conflicting\ndirections as the marketing, product development, and finance departments each get\ndifferent feedback from different sets of people. And without a system which ensures\ncollaborative exchanges within the company, it’s also easy for small ‘pockets of innovation\nto disappear. Innovation is a contact sport. You cant brief people just by saying, ‘We’re\ngoing in this direction and I’m going to take you with me.’\nCialdini believes that this ‘follow-the-leader syndrome, is dangerous, not least because it\nencourages bosses to go it alone. ‘It’s been scientifically proven that three people will be\nbetter than one at solving problems, even if that one person is the smartest person in the\nfield.’ To prove his point, Cialdini cites an interview with molecular biologist James Watson.\nWatson, together with Francis Crick, discovered the structure of DNA, the genetic\ninformation carrier of all living organisms. ‘When asked how they had cracked the code\nahead of an array of highly accomplished rival investigators, he said something that\nstunned me. He said ”he and Crick had succeeded because they were aware that they\n \n1\n\nweren’t the most intelligent of the scientists pursuing the answer. The smartest scientist\nwas called Rosalind Franklin who, Watson said, “was so intelligent she rarely sought\nadvice”.’\nTeamwork taps into one of the basic drivers of human behaviour. ‘The principle of social\nproof is so pervasive that we don’t even recognise it,’ says Cialdini. ‘If your project is being\nresisted, for example, by a group of veteran employees, ask another old-timer to speak up\nfor it.’ Cialdini is not alone in advocating this strategy. Research shows that peer power,\nused horizontally not vertically, is much more powerful than any boss’s speech.\nWriting, visualising and prototyping can stimulate the flow of new ideas. Cialdini cites\nscores of research papers and historical events that prove that even something as simple\nas writing deepens every individual’s engagement in the project. It is, he says, the reason\nwhy all those competitions on breakfast cereal packets encouraged us to write in saying, in\nno more than 10 words: ‘I like Kellogg’s Com Flakes because… .’ The very act of writing\nmakes us more likely to believe it.\nAuthority doesn’t have to inhibit innovation but it often does. The wrong kind of leadership\nwill lead to what Cialdini calls ”captainitis, the regrettable tendency of team members to opt\nout of team responsibilities that are properly their’. He calls it captainitis because, he says,\n”crew members of multipilot aircraft exhibit a sometimes deadly passivity when the flight\ncaptain makes a clearly wrong-headed decision”. This behaviour is not, he says, unique to\nair travel, but can happen in any workplace where the leader is overbearing.\nAt the other end of the scale is the 1980s Memphis design collective, a group of young\ndesigners for whom ”the only rule was that there were no rule”. This environment\nencouraged a free interchange of ideas, which led to more creativity with form, function,\ncolour and materials that revolutionised attitudes to furniture design.\nMany theorists believe the ideal boss should lead from behind, taking pride in collective\naccomplishment and giving credit where it is due. Cialdini says:”Leaders should encourage\neveryone to contribute and simultaneously assure all concerned that every\nrecommendation is important to making the right decision and will be given full attention”\nThe frustrating thing about innovation is that there are many approaches, but no magic\nformula. However, a manager who wants to create a truly innovative culture can make their\njob a lot easier by recognising these psychological realities.\n \n2",
