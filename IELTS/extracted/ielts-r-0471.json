  "passage_text": "Reading Practice\n \nThe Exploration of Mars\nA. In 1877, Giovanni Schiaparelli, an Italian astronomer, made drawings and maps of the\nMartian surface that suggested strange features. The images from telescopes at this time\nwere not as sharp as today’s. Schiaparelli said he could see a network of lines, or canali. In\n1894, an American astronomer, Percival Lowell, made a series of observations of Mars\nfrom his own observations of Mars from his own observatory at Flagstaff, Arizona, USA.\nLowell was convinced a great network of canals had been dug to irrigate crops for the\nMartian race! He suggested that each canal had fertile vegetation on either side, making\nthem noticeable from Earth. Drawings and globes he made show a network of canals and\noases all over the planet.\n \nB. The idea that there was intelligent life on Mars gained strength in the late 19th century.\nIn 1898, H.G. Wells wrote a science fiction classic, The War of the Worlds about an\ninvading force of Martians who try to conquer Earth. They use highly advanced technology\n(advanced for 1898) to crush human resistance in their path. In 1917, Edgar Rice\nBurroughs wrote the first in a series of 11 novels about Mars. Strange beings and\nrampaging Martian monsters gripped the public’s imagination. A radio broadcast by Orson\nWelles on Halloween night in 1938 of The War of the Worlds caused widespread panic\nacross America. People ran into the streets in their pyjamas-millions believed the dramatic\nreports of a Martian invasion.\nC. Probes are very important to our understanding of other planets. Much of our recent\nknowledge comes from these robotic missions into space. The first images sent back from\nMars came from Mariner 4 in July 1965. They showed a cratered and barren landscape,\nmore like the surface of our moon than Earth. In 1969, Mariners 6 and 7 were launched\nand took 200 photographs of Mars’s southern hemisphere and pole on fly-by missions. But\nthese showed little more information. In 1971, Mariner 9’s mission was to orbit the planet\nevery 12 hours. In 1975, The USA sent two Viking probes to the planet, each with a lander\nand an orbiter. The Landers had sampler arms to scoop up Maritain rocks and did\nexperiments to try and find signs of life. Although no life was found, they sent back the first\ncolour pictures of the planet’s surface and atmosphere from pivoting cameras.\nD. The Martian meteorite found in Earth aroused doubts to the above analysis. ALH84001\nmeteorite was discovered in December 1984 in Antarctica, by members of the ANSMET\nproject; The sample was ejected from Mars about 17 million years ago and spent 11,000\nyears in or on the Antarctic ice sheets. Composition analysis by NASA revealed a kind of\nmagnetite that on Earth, is only found in association with certain microorganisms. Some\nstructures resembling the mineralized casts of terrestrial bacteria and their appendages\nfibrils or by-products occur in the rims of carbonate globules and pre-terrestrial aqueous\nalteration regions. The size and shape of the objects is consistent with Earthly fossilized\nnanobacteria but the existence of nanobacteria itself is still controversial.\nE. In 1965, the Mariner 4 probe discovered that Mars had no global magnetic field that\nwould protect the planet from potentially life-threatening cosmic radiation and solar\nradiation; observations made in the late 1990s by the Mars Global Surveyor confirmed this\ndiscovery. Scientists speculate that the lack of magnetic shielding helped the solar wind\nblow away much of Mars’s atmosphere over the course of several billion years. After\n \n1\n\n \nmapping cosmic radiation levels at various depths on Mars, researchers have concluded\nthat any life within the first several meters of the planet’s surface would be killed by lethal\ndoses of cosmic radiation. In 2007, it was calculated that DNA and RNA damage by cosmic\nradiation would limit life on Mars to depths greater than 7.5 metres below the planet’s\nsurface. Therefore, the best potential locations for discovering life on Mars may be at\nsubsurface environments that have not been studied yet. Disappearance of the magnetic\nfield may played an significant role in the process of Martian climate change. According to\nthe valuation of the scientists, the climate of Mars gradually transits from warm and wet to\ncold and dry after magnetic field vanished.\n \nF. NASA’s recent missions have focused on another question: whether Mars held lakes or\noceans of liquid water on its surface in the ancient past. Scientists have found hematite, a\nmineral that forms in the presence of water. Thus, the mission of the Mars Exploration\nRovers of 2004 was not to look for present or past life, but for evidence of liquid water on\nthe surface of Mars in the planet’s ancient past. Liquid water, necessary for Earth life and\nfor metabolism as generally conducted by species on Earth, cannot exist on the surface of\nMars under its present low atmospheric pressure and temperature, except at the lowest\nshaded elevations for short periods and liquid water does not appear at the surface itself. In\nMarch 2004, NASA announced that its rover Opportunity had discovered evidence that\nMars was, in the ancient past, a wet planet. This had raised hopes that evidence of past life\nmight be found on the planet today. ESA confirmed that the Mars Express orbiter had\ndirectly detected huge reserves of water ice at Mars’ south pole in January 2004.\nG. Researchers from the Center of Astrobiology (Spain) and the Catholic University of the\nNorth in Chile have found an ‘oasis’ of microorganisms two meters below the surface of the\nAtacama Desert, SOLID, a detector for signs of life which could be used in environments\nsimilar to subsoil on Mars. “We have named it a ‘microbial oasis’ because we found\nmicroorganisms developing in a habitat that was rich in rock salt and other highly\nhygroscopic compounds that absorb water” explained Victor Parro, researcher from the\nCenter of Astrobiology in Spain. “If there are similar microbes on Mars or remains in similar\nconditions to the ones we have found in Atacama, we could detect them with instruments\nlike SOLID” Parro highlighted.\nH. Even more intriguing, however, is the alternative scenario by Spanish scientists: If those\nsamples could be found to that use DNA, as Earthly life does, as their genetic code. It is\nextremely unlikely that such a highly specialised, complex molecule like DNA could have\nevolved separately on the two planets, indicating that there must be a common origin for\nMartian and Earthly life. Life based on DNA first appeared on Mars and then spread to\nEarth, where it then evolved into the myriad forms of plants and creatures that exist today.\nIf this was found to be the case, we would have to face the logical conclusion: we are all\nMartian. If not, we would continue to search the life of signs.\n \n2",
