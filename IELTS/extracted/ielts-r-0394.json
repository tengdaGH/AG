The global population is expected to exceed nine billion by 2050 - up a third from today's\nlevel and studies suggest that food production will have to go up by 70 per cent if we are to\nfeed all of those new mouths This means that scientists will have to develop new ways of\ngrowing crops if we are to avoid a humanitarian crisis.

With this in mind, some scientists and agricultural experts are advocating an innovative\nalternative to traditional farming whereby skyscrapers packed with shelf-based systems for\ngrowing vegetables on each storey -known as 'vertical farms' - could hold the key to\nrevolutionising agriculture. Columbia University professor Dickson Despommier claims that\nvertical farming could boost crop yields many times over. A single 20-storey vertical farm\ncould theoretically feed 50 000 people, according to Despommier.

By\nsignificantly reducing the amount of land required for food production, vertical farms could\nhelp to enrich biodiversity. And according to Jeremijenko, this can, in turn, help to improve\nthe productivity of conventional farms, as the health of agricultural land is often tied to the\nhealth of the surrounding ecosystems. Furthermore, vertical farming could dramatically cut\nthe utilisation of fossil fuels. And also reduce geopolitical tensions in countries where poor\nfarming conditions cause conflict and malnutrition.\n \n2",
