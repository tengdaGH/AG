Apart\nfrom engendering widespread ecological disorders, pesticides have contributed to the\nemergence of a new breed of chemical-resistant, highly lethal superbugs. \nAccording to a recent study by the Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO), more than\n300 species of agricultural pests have developed resistance to a wide range of potent\nchemicals. Not to be left behind are the disease-spreading pests, about 100 species of\nwhich have become immune to a variety of insecticides now in use.\nOne glaring disadvantage of pesticides’ application is that, while destroying harmful pests,\nthey also wipe out many useful non-targeted organisms, which keep the growth of the pest\npopulation in check. This results in what agroecologists call the ‘treadmill syndrome’.\nBecause of their tremendous breeding potential and genetic diversity, many pests are\nknown to withstand synthetic chemicals and bear offspring with a built-in resistance to\npesticides.\nThe havoc that the ‘treadmill syndrome’ can bring about is well illustrated by what\nhappened to cotton farmers in Central America. In the early 1940s, basking in the glory of\nchemical-based intensive agriculture, the farmers avidly took to pesticides as a sure\nmeasure to boost crop yield. The insecticide was applied eight times a year in the mid-\n1940s, rising to 28 in a season in the mid-1950s, following the sudden proliferation of three\nnew varieties of chemical-resistant pests.\nBy the mid-1960s, the situation took an alarming turn with the outbreak of four more new\npests, necessitating pesticide spraying to such an extent that 50% of the financial outlay on\ncotton production was accounted for by pesticides. In the early 1970s, the spraying\nfrequently reached 70 times a season as the farmers were pushed to the wall by the\ninvasion of genetically stronger insect species.\nMost of the pesticides in the market today remain inadequately tested for properties that\ncause cancer and mutations as well as for other adverse effects on health, says a study by\nUnited States environmental agencies. The United States National Resource Defense\nCouncil has found that DDT was the most popular of a long list of dangerous chemicals in\nuse.\nIn the face of the escalating perils from indiscriminate applications of pesticides, a more\neffective and ecologically sound strategy of biological control, involving the selective use of\nnatural enemies of the pest population, is fast gaining popularity - though, as yet, it is a new\nfield with limited potential. The advantage of biological control in contrast to other methods\nis that it provides a relatively low-cost, perpetual control system with a minimum of\ndetrimental side-effects. When handled by experts, bio-control is safe, non-polluting and\nself-dispersing.\nThe Commonwealth Institute of Biological Control (CIBC) in Bangalore, with its global\nnetwork of research laboratories and field stations, is one of the most active, non-\ncommercial research agencies engaged in pest control by setting natural predators against\nparasites. CIBC also serves as a clearing-house for the export and import of biological\n \n1\n\nagents for pest control world-wide.\nCIBC successfully used a seed-feeding weevil, native to Mexico, to control the obnoxious\nparthenium weed, known to exert devious influence on agriculture and human health in\nboth India and Australia. Similarly the Hyderabad-based Regional Research Laboratory\n(RRL), supported by CIBC, is now trying out an Argentinian weevil for the eradication of\nwater hyacinth, another dangerous weed, which has become a nuisance in many parts of\nthe world. According to Mrs Kaiser Jamil of RRL, ‘The Argentinian weevil does not attack\nany other plant and a pair of adult bugs could destroy the weed in 4-5 days.’ CIBC is also\nperfecting the technique for breeding parasites that prey on ‘disapene scale’ insects -\nnotorious defoliants of fruit trees in the US and India.\nHow effectively biological control can be pressed into service is proved by the following\nexamples. In the late 1960s, when Sri Lanka’s flourishing coconut groves were plagued by\nleaf-mining hispides, a larval parasite imported from Singapore brought the pest under\ncontrol. A natural predator indigenous to India, Neodumetia sangawani, was found useful in\ncontrolling the Rhodes grass-scale insect that was devouring forage grass in many parts of\nthe US. By using Neochetina bruci, a beetle native to Brazil, scientists at Kerala Agricultural\nUniversity freed a 12-kilometre-long canal from the clutches of the weed Salvinia molesta,\npopularly called ‘African Payal’ in Kerala. About 30,000 hectares of rice fields in Kerala are\ninfested by this weed.\n \n2",
