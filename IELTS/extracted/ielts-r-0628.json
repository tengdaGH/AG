  "passage_text": "Reading Practice\n \nWheel of Fortune\n \nEmma Duncan discusses the potential effects on the entertainment industry of\nthe digital revolution\n \nA Since moving pictures were invented a century ago, a new way of distributing\nentertainment to consumers has emerged about once every generation. Each such\ninnovation has changed the industry irreversibly; each has been accompanied by a\nperiod of fear mixed with exhilaration. The arrival of digital technology, which\ntranslates music, pictures and text into the zeros and ones of computer language,\nmarks one of those periods.\n \nB This may sound familiar, because the digital revolution, and the explosion of\nchoice that would go with it, has been heralded for some time. In 1992, John Malone,\nchief executive of TCI, an American cable giant, welcomed the '500-channel\nuniverse'. Digital television was about to deliver everything except pizzas to people's\nliving rooms. When the entertainment companies tried out the technology, it worked\nfine - but not at a price that people were prepared to pay.\n \nC Those 500 channels eventually arrived but via the Internet and the PC rather than\nthrough television. The digital revolution was starting to affect the entertainment\nbusiness in unexpected ways. Eventually it will change every aspect of it, from the\nway cartoons are made to the way films are screened to the way people buy music.\nThat much is clear. What nobody is sure of is how it will affect the economics of the\nbusiness.\n \nD New technologies always contain within them both threats and opportunities. They\nhave the potential both to make the companies in the business a great deal richer,\nand to sweep them away. Old companies always fear new technology. Hollywood\nwas hostile to television, television terrified by the VCR. Go back far enough, points\nout Hal Varian, an economist at the University of California at Berkeley, and you find\npublishers complaining that 'circulating libraries' would cannibalise their sales. Yet\nwhenever a new technology has come in, it has made more money for existing\nentertainment companies. The proliferation of the means of distribution results,\ngratifyingly, in the proliferation of dollars, pounds, pesetas and the rest to pay for it.\n \nE All the same, there is something in the old companies' fears. New technologies\nmay not threaten their lives, but they usually change their role. Once television\nbecame widespread, film and radio stopped being the staple form of entertainment.\nCable television has undermined the power of the broadcasters. And as power has\nshifted the movie studios, the radio companies and the television broadcasters have\nbeen swallowed up. These days, the grand old names of entertainment have more\nresonance than power. Paramount is part of Viacom, a cable company; Universal,\npart of Seagram, a drinks-and-entertainment company; MGM, once the roaring lion\nof Hollywood, has been reduced to a whisper because it is not part of one of the\ngiants. And RCA, once the most important broadcasting company in the world, is\nnow a recording label belonging to Bertelsmann, a large German entertainment\ncompany.\nF Part of the reason why incumbents got pushed aside was that they did not see\n \n1\n\nwhat was coming. But they also faced a tighter regulatory environment than the\npresent one. In America, laws preventing television broadcasters from owning\nprogramme companies were repealed earlier this decade, allowing the creation of\nvertically integrated businesses. Greater freedom, combined with a sense of history,\nprompted the smarter companies in the entertainment business to re-invent\nthemselves. They saw what happened to those of their predecessors who were stuck\nwith one form of distribution.\n \nSo, these days, the powers in the entertainment business are no longer movie studios, or\ntelevision broadcasters, or publishers; all those businesses have become part of bigger\nbusinesses still, companies that can both create content and distribute it in a range of\ndifferent ways.\nG Out of all this, seven huge entertainment companies have emerged - Time Warner,\nWalt Disney, Bertelsmann, Viacom, News Corp, Seagram and Sony. They cover\npretty well every bit of the entertainment business except pornography. Three are\nAmerican, one is Australian, one Canadian, one German and one Japanese. 'What\nyou are seeing', says Christopher Dixon, managing director of media research at\nPaineWebber, a stockbroker, 'is the creation of a global oligopoly.\nIt happened to the oil and automotive businesses earlier this century; now it is happening to\nthe entertainment business.' It remains to be seen whether the latest technology will\nweaken those great companies, or make them stronger than ever.\n \n2",
