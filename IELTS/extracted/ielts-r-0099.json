The chinstrap penguin has a cap of black plumage, a white face, and a continuous\nband of black feathers extending from one side of the head to the other, the\n“chinstrap.” The northern part of the Antarctic Peninsula, several Antarctic and\nsubantarctic islands, and the uninhabited Balleny Islands between Antarctica and\nNew Zealand are the habitats of the species.\nB. Antarctic penguin colonies in some parts of the Antarctic have declined over the last\n50 years, mostly because of climate change, researchers say.
