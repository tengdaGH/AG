  "passage_text": "Reading Practice\n \nA Brief History of Tea\nA\nThe story of tea began in ancient China over 5,000 years ago. According to legend, the\nEmperor Shen Nung was a skilled ruler, creative scientist and patron of the arts. His\nfarsighted edicts required, among other things, that all drinking water be boiled as a\nhygienic precaution. One summer day while visiting a distant region of his realm, he and\nthe court stopped to rest. In accordance with his ruling, the servants began to boil water for\nthe court to drink. Dried leaves from a nearby bush fell into the boiling water, and as the\nleaves infused the water turned brown. As a scientist, the Emperor was intrigued by the\nnew liquid, drank some, and found it very refreshing. And so, according to legend, tea was\ncreated.\nB\nTea consumption spread throughout Chinese culture, reaching into every aspect of the\nsociety: The first definitive book was written on tea - a book clearly reflecting Zen Buddhist\nphilosophy - 1,200 years ago, The first tea seeds were brought to Japan by a returning\nBuddhist priest, who had seen the value of tea in enhancing meditation in China. As a\nresult, he is known as the 'Father of Tea' in Japan. Because of this early association, tea in\nJapan has always been linked with Zen Buddhism. Tea received the Japanese Emperots\nsupport almost instantly and spread rapidly from the royal court and monasteries to other\nsections of society.\nB\nTea was elevated to an art form in the Japanese tea ceremony, in which supreme\nimportance is given to making tea in the most perfect, most polite, most graceful, most\ncharming manner possible. Such a purity of expression prompted the creation of a\nparticular form of architecture for tea house: duplicating the simplicity of a forest cottage.\nThe cultural/artistic hostesses of Japan, the geishas, began to specialize in the\npresentation of the tea ceremony. However, as more and more people became involved in\nthe excitement surrounding tea, the purity of the original concept was lost, and for a period\nthe tea ceremony became corrupted, boisterous and highly embellished. Efforts were then\nmade to return to the earlier simplicity, with the result that, in the 15th and 16th centuries,\ntea was viewed as the ultimate gift. Even warlords paused for tea before battles.\nWhile tea was at this high level of development in parts of Asia, information concerning the\nthen unknown beverage began to filter back to Europe. Earlier traders had mentioned it, btit\nwere unclear as to whether tea should be eaten or drunk. The first European to personally\nencounter tea and write about it was Portuguese - Portugal, with her technologically\nadvanced navy, had been successful in gaining the first right of trade with China.\nE\nTea finally arrived in Europe in the 16tr’ century, brought to Holland by the country's navy,\nand becoming very fashionable in the Dutch capital, the Hague. This was due in part to tea\nbeing very expensive (over $100 per pound), which immediately made it the domain of the\nwealthy. Slowly, as the amount of tea imported increased, the price fell, and by 1675 it was\navailable in common food shops throughout Holland.\n \n1\n\nF\nAs the consumption of tea increased dramatically in Dutch society, doctors and university\nauthorities in Holland argued as to its benefits or drawbacks.
