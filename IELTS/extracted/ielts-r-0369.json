  "passage_text": "Reading Practice\n \nResearcher on the Tree Crown\nA\nThe forest canopy – the term given to the aggregated crowns of trees in a forest – is\nthought to host up to 40 per cent of all species, of which ten per cent could be unique to the\nforest roof. “We’re dealing with the richest, least known, most threatened habitat on Earth,”\nsays Andrew Mitchell, the executive director of the Global Canopy Programme (GCP), a\ncollection of groups undertaking research into this lofty world. “The problem with our\nunderstanding of forests is that nearly all the information we have has been gleaned from\njust two meters above the soil, and yet we’re dealing with trees that grow to heights of 60\nmeters, or in the case of the tallest redwood 112 meters. It’s like doctors trying to treat\nhumans by only looking at their feet.”\nB\nTropical rainforest comprises the richest of ecosystems, rivalled only by coral reel for its\ndiversity and complex interrelationships. And a great deal of that diversity lives up in the\ncanopy – an estimated 70-90 per cent of life in the rainforest exists in the trees; one in ten\nof all vascular plants are canopy dwellers, and about 20-25 per cent of all invertebrates are\nthought to be unique to the canopy.\nC\nThe first Briton to actually get into the canopy may have been Sir Francis Drake who, in\n1573, gained his first glimpse of the Pacific Ocean from a tall tree in Darien, Panama.\nHowever, the first serious effort to reach and study the canopy didn’t begin until 1929. The\nOxford University Expedition to British Guiana, led by Major RWG Hingston, still ended up\nhelp of locals when it came to building an observation platform. It was a successful\nexpedition all the same, despite the colony’s acting governor getting stuck high up on a\nwinched seat during a visit. In terms of canopy access, the French have proved themselves\nto be excellent innovators, taking things further with the development of ‘lighter-than-air\nplatforms -balloons and related equipment, to you and me. Francis Halle; from the\nLaboratoire de Botanique Tropicale at Montpellier University took to a balloon in the mid-\n1980s in order to approach the canopy from above. His work in French Guiana was\ninspired by the use in Gabon of a tethered helium balloon by Marcel and Annette Hladick.\nHalle went one further by using a small purpose-built airship-a cigar-shaped balloon with\npropellers to aid manoeuvrability. “We suddenly had a mobile system that could move\naround the treetops; there were no other means of doing this,” says Mitchell.\nD\nFrom this, two balloon-dependent features have developed: the radeau or raft, and the luge\nor sledge. The raft is a ‘floating’ platform, employed by French academics Dany Cleyet-\nMarrel and Laurent Pyot and is essentially an island in the treetops. Made of kevlar mesh\nnetting and edged with inflated neoprene tubes, it rests on top of the canopy, allowing\nsampling (mostly of plants and insects) to take place at the edges of the platform, and can\nstay in position for several days. The luge, on the other hand, is an inflated hexagon similar\nto a traditional balloon basket but with a hole in the bottom covered with Kevlar mesh. Such\ntechniques aren’t without their problems, however, “balloons can cover larger areas,\n \n1\n\nespecially for collection purposes, but they are extremely expensive- Jibe raft alone cost\n122,000 [euro] (86,000 [pounds sterling]) in 2001], nut very effective because you can only\nreach the tops of the trees, and are highly dependent on the weather, ” says Dr Wilfried\nMorawetz, director of systematic botany at the University of Leipzig. “Balloons can usually\nonly be used in the early morning for two to four hours. Last time, we could only fly three\ntimes during the whole week.” Given these factors, it comes as no surprise that operations\ninvolving these balloons numbered just six between 1986 and 2001.\nE\nSmithsonian Tropical Research Institute in Panama. Smith had the idea of using a static\ncrane to get into the treetops. Un-tethered balloons may allow widely distributed sites to be\nsampled, but cranes allow scientists to study an area of at least a hectare from soil to\ncanopy throughout the year, year after year. “Cranes beat any other access mode. They\nare cheap, reliable and fast. In two minutes I can reach any point in our forest, which is\nessential for comparative measurements across species,” says Professor Christian Korner\nof the University of Basel. Korner is using a static crane in a unique carbon dioxide-\nenrichment experiment in Switzerland, in an attempt to discover how forests might respond\nto the global increase in atmospheric carbon dioxide (see Swiss canopy-crane carbon\nexperiment, right). For reasons of convenience, cranes are generally situated close to cities\nor a research center. Leipzig University has a crane not far from the town, the Location\nallowing scientists to study the effect of city pollutants on forests. In order to increase the\namount of canopy a crane can access, some have been mounted on short rail tracks. In\n“1995, Dr Wilfried Morawetz was the first to use this technique, installing a crane on 150\nmeters of track in the Venezuelan rainforest. “In my opinion, cranes should be the core of\ncanopy research in the future,” he says.\nF\nIt appears that the rest of the scientific community has now come around to Mitchell’s way\nof thinking. “I think most scientists thought him mad to consider such a complex field station\nat first,” says internationally respected ‘canopist’ Meg Lowman, the executive director of the\nMarie Selby Botanical Gardens. “However, we’ve all come to realize that a combination of\nmethods, a long-term approach to ecological studies and a collaborative approach are the\nabsolute best ways to advance canopy science. A permanent canopy field station would\nallow that to happen.” With A dedicated group of canopy scientists working together and a\nwide range of tools available for them to get into the treetops, we’re now finally on our way\ntowards a true understanding of the least-known terrestrial habitat.\n \n2",
