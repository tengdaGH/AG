  "passage_text": "Reading Practice\n \nLearning color words\n \nYoung children struggle with color concepts, and the reason for this may have something to\ndo with how we use the words that describe them.\n \nA In the course of the first few years of their lives, children who are brought up in English-\nspeaking homes successfully master the use of hundreds of words. Words for objects,\nactions, emotions, and many other aspects of the physical world quickly become part of\ntheir infant repertoire. For some reason, however, when it comes to learning color words,\nthe same children perform very badly. At the age of four months, babies can\ndistinguish between basic color categories. Yet it turns out they do this in much the same\nway as blind children. \"Blue\" and \"yellow\" appear in older children's expressive language in\nanswer to questions such as \"What color is this?\", but their mapping of objects to individual\ncolors is haphazard and interchangeable. If shown a blue cup and asked about its color,\ntypical two-year-olds seem as likely to come up with \"red\" as \"blue.\" Even after hundreds of\ntraining trials, children as old as four may still end up being unable to accurately sort\nobjects by color.\nB In an effort to work out why this is, cognitive scientists at Stanford University in California\nhypothesized that children's incompetence at color-word learning may be directly linked to\nthe way these words are used in English. While word order for color adjectives varies, they\nare used overwhelmingly in pre-nominal position (e.g. \"blue cup\"); in other words, the\nadjective comes before the noun it is describing. This is in contrast to post-nominal position\n(e.g. \"The cup is blue\") where the adjective comes after the noun. It seems that the\ndifficulty children have may not be caused by any unique property of color, or indeed, of the\nworld. Rather, it may simply come down to the challenge of having to make predictions\nfrom color words to the objects they refer to, instead of being able to make predictions from\nthe world of objects to the color words.\n \nTo illustrate, the word \"chair\" has a meaning that applies to the somewhat varied set of\nentities in the world that people use for sitting on. Chairs have features, such as arms and\nlegs and backs, that are combined to some degree in a systematic way; they turn up in a\nrange of chairs of different shapes, sizes, and ages. It could be said that children learn to\nnarrow down the set of cues that make up a chair and in this way they learn the concept\nassociated with that word. On the other hand, color words tend to be unique and not bound\nto other specific co-occurring features; there is nothing systematic about color words to\nhelp cue their meaning. In the speech that adults direct at children, color adjectives occur\npre-nominally (\"blue cup\") around 70 percent of the time. This suggests that most of what\nchildren hear from adults will, in fact, be unhelpful in learning what color words refer to.\nC To explore this idea further, the research team recruited 41 English children aged\nbetween 23 and 29 months and carried out a three- phase experiment. It consisted of a\npre-test, followed by training in the use of color words, and finally a post-test that was\nidentical to the pre-test. The pre- and post-test materials comprised six objects that were\nnovel to the children. There were three examples of each object in each of three\ncolors—red, yellow, and blue. The objects were presented on trays, and in both tests, the\nchildren were asked to pick out objects in response to requests in which the color word was\neither a prenominal (\"Which is the red one?\") or a post-nominal (\"Which one is red?\").\nIn the training, the children were introduced to a \"magic bucket\" containing five sets of\n \n1\n\n \nitems familiar to 26-month-olds (balls, cups, crayons, glasses, and toy bears) in each of the\nthree colors. The training was set up so that half the children were presented with the items\none by one and heard them labelled with color words used pre-nominally (\"This is a red\ncrayon\"), while the other half were introduced to the same items described with a post-\nnominal color word (\"This crayon is red\"). After the training, the children repeated the\nselection task on the unknown items in the post-test. To assess the quality of children's\nunderstanding of the color words, and the effect of each type of training, correct choices on\nitems that were consistent across the pre- and post-tests were used to measure children's\ncolor knowledge.\nD Individual analysis of pre- and post-test data, which confirmed parental vocabulary\nreports, showed the children had at least some knowledge of the three colour words: they\naveraged two out of three correct choices in response to both pre- and post-nominal\nquestion types, which, it has been pointed out, is better than chance. When children's\nresponses to the question types were assessed independently, performance was at its\nmost consistent when children were both trained and tested on post-nominal adjectives,\nand worst when trained on pre-nominal adjectives and tested on post-nominal adjectives.\nOnly children who had been trained with post- nominal color-word presentation and then\ntested with post-nominal question types were significantly more accurate than chance.\nComparing the pre- and post-test scores across each condition revealed a significant\ndecline in performance when children were both pre- and post-tested with questions that\nplaced the color words pre-nominally.\n \nAs predicted, when children are exposed to color adjectives in post-nominal position, they\nlearn them rapidly (after just five training trials per color); when they are presented with\nthem pre-nominally, as English overwhelmingly tends to do, children show no signs of\nlearning.\n \n2",
