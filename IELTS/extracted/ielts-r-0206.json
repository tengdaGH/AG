  "passage_text": "Reading Practice\n \nHow Fair is Fair Trade?\nThe fair-trade movement began in Europe in earnest in the post-war period, but only in the\nlast 25 years has it grown to include producers and consumers in over 60 countries.\nIn the 1950s and 60s, many people in the developed world felt passionately about the\nenormous disparities between developed and developing countries, and they believed the\nsystem of international trade shut out African, Asian, and South American producers who\ncould not compete with multinational companies or who came from states that, for political\nreasons, were not trading with the West. The catchphrase ‘Trade Not Aid’ was used by\nchurch groups and trade unions – early supporters of fair trade – who also considered that\ninternational aid was either a pittance or a covert form of subjugation. These days, much\nfair trade does include aid: developed-world volunteers offer their services, and there is\nfree training for producers and their workers.\nTea, coffee, cocoa, cotton, flowers, handicrafts, and gold are all major fair-trade items, with\ncoffee being the most recognisable, fund on supermarket shelves and at café chains\nthroughout the developed world.\nAlthough around two million farmers and workers produce fair-trade items, this is a tiny\nnumber in relation to total global trade. Still, fair-trade advocates maintain that the system\nhas positively impacted upon many more people worldwide, while the critics claim that if\nthose two million returned to the mainstream trading system, they would receive higher\nprices for their goods or labour.\nFair trade is supposed to be a trade that is fair to producers. Its basic tenet is that\ndeveloped-world consumers will pay slightly more for end products in the knowledge that\ndeveloping-world producers have been equitably remunerated, and that the products have\nbeen made in decent circumstances. Additionally, the fair-trade system diers from that of\nthe open market because there is a minimum price paid for goods, which may be higher\nthan that of the open market. Secondly, a small premium, earmarked for community\ndevelopment, is added in good years; for example, coee co-operatives in South America\nfrequently receive an additional 25c per kilogram. Lastly, purchasers of fair-trade products\nmay assist with crop pre-financing or with the training of producers and workers, which\ncould take the form of improving product quality, using environmentally friendly fertilisers,\nor raising literacy. Research has shown that non-fair-trade farmers copy some fair-trade\nfarming practices, and, occasionally, encourage social progress. In exchange for ethical\npurchase and other assistance, fair-trade producers agree not to use child or slave labour,\nto adhere to the United Nations Charter on Human Rights, to provide safe workplaces, and\nto protect the environment despite these not being legally binding in their own countries.\nHowever, few non-fair-trade farmers have adopted these practices, viewing them as little\nmore than rich-world conceits.\nSo that consumers know which products are made under fair-trade conditions, goods are\nlabelled, and, these days, a single European and American umbrella organisation\nsupervises labelling, standardisation, and inspection.\nWhile fair trade is increasing, the system is far from perfect. First and foremost, there are\nexpenses involved in becoming a fair-trade-certified producer, meaning the desperately\npoor rarely participate, so the very farmers fair-trade advocates originally hoped to support\n \n1\n\nare excluded. Secondly, because conforming to the standards of fair-trade certification is\ncostly, some producers deliberately mislabel their goods. The fair-trade monitoring process\nis patchy, and unfortunately, around 12% of fair-trade-labelled produce is nothing of the\nkind. Next, a crop may genuinely be produced under fair-trade conditions, but due to a lack\nof demand cannot be sold as fair trade, so goes onto the open market, where prices are\nmostly lower. It is estimated that only between 18-37% of fair-trade output is actually sold\nas fair trade. Sadly, there is little reliable research on the real relationship between costs\nincurred and revenue for fair-trade farmers, although empirical evidence suggests that\nmany never realise a profit. Partly, reporting from producers is inadequate, and ways of\ndetermining profit may not include credit, harvesting, transport, or processing. Sometimes,\nthe price paid to fair-trade producers is lower than that of the open market, so while a crop\nmay be sold, elsewhere it could have earnt more, or where there are profits, they are often\ntaken by the corporate firms that buy the goods and sell them on to retailers.\nThere are problems with the developed-world part of the equation too. People who\nvolunteer to work for fair-trade concerns may do so believing they are assisting farmers\nand communities, whereas their labour serves to enrich middlemen and retailers.\nCompanies involved in West African cocoa production have been criticised for this. In the\ndeveloped world, the right to use a fair-trade logo is also expensive for packers and\nretailers, and sometimes a substantial amount of the money received from sale is ploughed\nback into marketing. In richer parts of the developed world, notably in London, packers and\nretailers charge high prices for fair-trade products. Consumers imagine they are paying so\nmuch because more money is returned to producers when profit-taking by retailers or\npackers is a more likely scenario. One UK café chain is known to have passed on 1.6% of\nthe extra 18% is charged for fair-trade coee to producers. However, this happens with other\nitems at the supermarket or cafe, so perhaps consumers are naive to believe fair-traders\nbehave otherwise. In addition, there are struggling farmers in rich countries, too, so some\ncritics think fair-trade associations should certify them. Other critics find the entire fair-trade\nsystem awed – nothing more than a colossal marketing scam- and they would rather assist\nthe genuinely poor in more transparent ways, but this criticism may be overblown since fair\ntrade has endured for and been praised in the developing world itself.\n \n2",
