  "passage_text": "Reading Practice\n \nThe development of the silk industry\nSilk, a natural fibre produced by a particular worm called a silkworm, has been used in\nclothing for many centuries.\nWhen silk was first discovered in China over 4,500 years ago, it was reserved exclusively\nfor the use of the emperor, his close relations and the very highest of his dignitaries. Within\nthe palace, the emperor is believed to have worn a robe of white silk; outside, he, his\nprincipal wife, and the heir to the throne wore yellow, the colour of the earth.\nGradually silk came into more general use, and the various classes of Chinese society\nbegan wearing tunics of silk. As well as being used for clothing and decoration, silk was\nquite quickly put to industrial use, and rapidly became one of the principal elements of the\nChinese economy. It was used in the production of musical instruments, as string for\nfishing, and even as the world’s first luxury paper. Eventually even the common people\nwere able to wear garments of silk.\nDuring the Han dynasty (206 BC-220 AD), silk ceased to be a mere fabric and became a\nform of currency. Farmers paid their taxes in grain and silk, and silk was used to pay civil\nservants and to reward subjects for outstanding services. Values were calculated in lengths\nof silk as they had previously been calculated in weight of gold. Before long, silk became a\ncurrency used in trade with foreign countries, which continued into the Tang dynasty (616-\n907 AD). It is possible that this added importance was the result of a major increase in\nproduction. Silk also found its way so thoroughly into the Chinese language that 230 of the\n5,000 most common characters of Mandarin* have 'silk' as their key component. Silk\nbecame a precious commodity, highly sought after by other countries from an early date,\nand it is believed that the silk trade.\nactually existed before the Silk Road1\" was officially opened in the second century BC. An\nEgyptian mummy with a silk thread in her hair, dating from 1070 BC, has been discovered\nin the village of Deir el Medina near the Valley of the Kings, and is probably the earliest\nevidence of the silk trade. During the second century BC, the Chinese emperor Han Wu\nDi’s ambassadors travelled as far west as Persia and Mesopotamis, bearing gifts including\nsilks. A range of important finds of Chinese silks have also been made along the Silk Road.\nOne of the most dramatic of these finds was some Tang silk discovered in 1900. It is\nbelieved that around 1015 AD Buddhist monks, possibly alarmed by the threat of invasion\nby Tibetan people, had sealed more than ten thousand manuscripts and silk paintings, silk\nbanners and textiles in caves near Dunhuang, a trading station on the Silk Road in north-\nwest China.\nSome historians believe the first Europeans to set eyes upon the fabulous fabric were the\nRoman legions of Marcus Licinius Crassus, Governor of Syria. According to certain\naccounts of the period, at an important battle near the Euphrates River in 53 BC, the\nRoman soldiers were so startled by the bright silken banners of the enemy that they fled in\npanic. Yet, within decades Chinese silks were widely worn by the rich and noble families of\nRome. The Roman Emperor Heliogabalus (218-222 AD) wore nothing but silk. By 380 AD,\nthe Roman historian Marcellinnus Ammianus reported that. The use of silk, which was\none confined to the nobility, has now spread to all classes without distinction - even to the\nlowest. The desire for silk continued to increase over the centuries. Despite this demand,\nthe price of silk remained very high.\n \n1\n\nIn spite of their secrecy about production methods, the Chinese eventually lost their\nmonopoly on silk production. Knowledge of silk production methods reached Korea around\n200 BC, when waves of Chinese immigrants arrived there. Shortly after 300 AD, it travelled\nwestward, and the cultivation of the silkworm was established in India.\nAround 550 AD silk production reached the Middle East. Records indicate that two monks\nfrom Constantinople (modern-day Istanbul), capital of the Byzantine Empire, appeared at\ntheir emperor’s court with silkworm eggs which they had obtained secretly, and hidden in\ntheir hollow bamboo walking sticks. Under their supervision the eggs hatched into worms,\nand the worms spun silk threads. Byzantium was in the silk business at last. The Byzantine\nchurch and state created imperial workshops, monopolising production and keeping the\nsecret to themselves. This allowed a silk industry to be established, undercutting the\nmarket for ordinary-grade Chinese silk. However, high quality silk textiles, woven in China\nespecially for the Middle Eastern market, continued to achieve high prices in the West, and\ntrade along the Silk Road continued as before. By the sixth century the Persians, too, had\nmastered the art of silk weaving, developing their own rich patterns and techniques. But it\nwasn’t until the 13th century that Italy began silk production, with the introduction of 2,000\nskilled silk weavers from Constantinople. Eventually, silk production became widespread\nthroughout Europe.\nWorld silk production has approximately doubled during the last 30 years in spite of\nmanmade fibres replacing certain uses of silk. Before this period, China and Japan were\nthe two main producers, together manufacturing more than 50 per cent of world production\neach year. After the late 1970s, however, China dramatically increased its silk production,\nand once again became the world’s leading producer.\n \n2",
