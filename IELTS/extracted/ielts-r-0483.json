  "passage_text": "Reading Practice\nThe harm that picture books can cause\nA\nThere is a great concern in Europe and North America about declining standards of literacy\nin schools. In Britain, the fact that 30 per cent of 16 year olds have a reading age of 14 or\nless has helped to prompt massive educational changes. The development of literacy has\nfar-reaching effects on general intellectual development and thus anything which impedes\nthe development of literacy is a serious matter for us all. So the hunt is on for the cause of\nthe decline in literacy. The search so far has focused on socioeconomic factors, or the\neffectiveness of 'traditional' versus 'modern' teaching techniques.\nB\nThe fruitless search for the cause of the increase in illiteracy is a tragic example of the\nsaying 'They can't see the wood for the trees'. When teachers use picture books, they are\nsimply continuing a long-established tradition that is accepted without question. And for the\npast two decades, illustrations in reading primers have become increasingly detailed and\nobtrusive, while language has become impoverished — sometimes to the point of\nextinction.\nC\nAmazingly, there is virtually no empirical evidence to support the use of illustrations in\nteaching reading. On the contrary, a great deal of empirical evidence shows that pictures\ninterfere in a damaging way with all aspects of learning to read. Despite this, from North\nAmerica to the Antipodes, the first books that many school children receive are totally\nwithout text.\nD\nA teacher's main concern is to help young beginner readers to develop not only the ability\nto recognise words, but the skills necessary to understand what these words mean. Even if\na child is able to read aloud fluently, he or she may not be able to understand much of it:\nthis is called 'barking at text'. The teacher's task of improving comprehension is made\nharder by influences outside the classroom. But the adverse effects of such things as\ntelevision, video games, or limited language experiences at home, can be offset by\nexperiencing 'rich' language at school.\nE\nInstead, it is not unusual for a book of 30 or more pages to have only one sentence full of\nrepetitive phrases. The artwork is often marvellous, but the pictures make the language\nredundant, and the children have no need to imagine anything when they read such books.\nLooking at a picture actively prevents children younger than nine from creating a mental\nimage, and can make it difficult for older children. In order to learn how to comprehend,\nthey need to practise making their own meaning in response to text. They need to have\ntheir innate powers of imagination trained.\nF\n \n1\n\nAs they grow older, many children turn aside from books without pictures, and it is a\nsituation made more serious as our culture becomes more visual. It is hard to wean\nchildren off picture books when pictures have played a major part throughout their\nformative reading experiences, and when there is competition for their attention from so\nmany other sources of entertainment. The least intelligent are most vulnerable, but tests\nshow that even intelligent children are being affected. The response of educators has been\nto extend the use of pictures in books and to simplify the language, even at senior levels.\nThe Universities of Oxford and Cambridge recently held joint conferences to discuss the\nnoticeably rapid decline in literacy among their undergraduates. \nG\nPictures are also used to help motivate children to read because they are beautiful and\neye-catching. But motivation to read should be provided by listening to stories well read,\nwhere children imagine in response to the story. Then, as they start to read, they have this\nexperience to help them understand the language. If we present pictures to save children\nthe trouble of developing these creative skills, then I think we are making a great mistake.\nH\nAcademic journals ranging from educational research, psychology, language learning,\npsycholinguistics, and so on cite experiments which demonstrate how detrimental pictures\nare for beginner readers. Here is a brief selection:\nI\n \nThe research results of the Canadian educationalist Dale Willows were clear and\nconsistent: pictures affected speed and accuracy and the closer the pictures were to the\nwords, the slower and more inaccurate the child's reading became. She claims that when\nchildren come to a word they already know, then the pictures are unnecessary and\ndistracting. If they do not know a word and look to the picture for a clue to its meaning, they\nmay well be misled by aspects of the pictures which are not closely related to the meaning\nof the word they are trying to understand.\nJ\nJay Samuels, an American psychologist, found that poor readers given no pictures learnt\nsignificantly more words than those learning to read with books with pictures. He examined\nthe work of other researchers who had reported problems with the use of pictures and who\nfound that a word without a picture was superior to a word plus a picture. When children\nwere given words and pictures, those who seemed to ignore the pictures and pointed at the\nwords learnt more words than the children who pointed at the pictures, but they still learnt\nfewer words than the children who had no illustrated stimuli at all.\n \n2",
