  "passage_text": "Reading Practice\n \nOvercoming the language barrier\nThe discovery that language can be a barrier to communication is quickly made by all who\ntravel, study, govern or sell. Whether the activity is tourism, research, government, policing,\nbusiness, or data dissemination, the lack of a common language can severely impede\nprogress or can halt it altogether. 'Common language' here usually means a foreign\nlanguage, but the same point applies in principle to any encounter with unfamiliar dialects\nor styles within a single language. 'They don't talk the same language' has a major\nmetaphorical meaning alongside its literal one.\nAlthough communication problems of this kind must happen thousands of times each day,\nvery few become public knowledge. Publicity comes only when a failure to communicate\nhas major consequences, such as strikes, lost orders, legal problems, or fatal accidents -\neven, at times, war. One reported instance of communication failure took place in 1970,\nwhen several Americans ate a species of poisonous mushroom. No remedy was known,\nand two of the people died within days. A radio report of the case was heard by a chemist\nwho knew of a treatment that had been successfully used in 1959 and published in 1963.\nWhy had the American doctors not heard of it seven years later? Presumably because the\nreport of the treatment had been published only in journals written in European languages\nother than English.\nSeveral comparable cases have been reported. But isolated examples do not give an\nimpression of the size of the problem — something that can come only from studies of the\nuse or avoidance of foreign-language materials and contacts in different communicative\nsituations. In the English-speaking scientific world, for example, surveys of books and\ndocuments consulted in libraries and other information agencies have shown that very little\nforeign-language material is ever consulted. Library requests in the field of science and\ntechnology showed that only 13 per cent were for foreign language periodicals. Studies of\nthe sources cited in publications lead to a similar conclusion: the use of foreign- language\nsources is often found to be as low as 10 per cent.\nThe language barrier presents itself in stark form to firms who wish to market their products\nin other countries. British industry, in particular, has in recent decades often been criticised\nfor its linguistic insularity — for its assumption that foreign buyers will be happy to\ncommunicate in English, and that awareness of other languages is not therefore a priority.\nIn the 1960s, over two-thirds of British firms dealing with • non-English-speaking customers\nwere using English for outgoing correspondence; many had their sales literature only in\nEnglish; and as many as 40 per cent employed no-one able to communicate in the\ncustomers' languages. A similar problem was identified in other English-speaking\ncountries, notably the USA, Australia and New Zealand. And non-English-speaking\ncountries were by no means exempt - although the widespread use of English as an\nalternative language made them less open to the charge of insularity.\nThe criticism and publicity given to this problem since the 1960s seems to have greatly\nimproved the situation, industrial training schemes have promoted an increase in linguistic\nand cultural awareness. Many firms now have their own translation services; to take just\none example in Britain, Rowntree Mackintosh now publish their documents in six\nlanguages (English, French, German, Dutch, Italian and Xhosa). Some firms run part-time\nlanguage courses in the languages of the countries with which they are most involved;\n \n1\n\nsome produce their own technical glossaries, to ensure consistency when material is being\ntranslated. It is now much more readily appreciated that marketing efforts can be delayed,\ndamaged, or disrupted by a failure to take account of the linguistic needs of the customer.\nThe changes in awareness have been most marked in English-speaking countries, where\nthe realisation has gradually dawned that by no means everyone in the world knows\nEnglish well enough to negotiate in it. This is especially a problem when English is not an\nofficial language of public administration, as in most parts of the Far East, Russia, Eastern\nEurope, the Arab world, Latin America and French- speaking Africa. Even in cases where\nforeign customers can speak English quite well, it is often forgotten that they may not be\nable to understand it to the required level - bearing in mind the regional and social variation\nwhich permeates speech and which can cause major problems of listening comprehension.\nIn securing understanding, how 'we' speak to 'them' is just as important, it appears, as how\n'they' speak to 'us'.\n \n2",
