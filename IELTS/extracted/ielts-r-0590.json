  "passage_text": "Reading Practice\n \nTraffic Jams — No End in Sight\nA.\nThere are no easy answers to the problems of traffic congestion. Traffic congestion affects\npeople throughout the world. Traffic jams cause smog in dozens of cities across both the\ndeveloped and developing world.\nIn the U.S., commuters spend an average of a full work week each year sitting in traffic,\naccording to the Texas Transportation Institute. While alternative ways of getting around\nare available, most people still choose their cars because they are looking for convenience,\ncomfort and privacy.\nB.\nThe most promising technique for reducing city traffic is called congestion pricing, whereby\ncities charge a toll to enter certain parts of town at certain times of day.\nIn theory, if the toll is high enough, some drivers will cancel their trips or go by bus or train.\nAnd in practice it seems to work: Singapore, London and Stockholm have reduced traffic\nand pollution in city centers thanks to congestion pricing.\nC.\nAnother way to reduce rush hour traffic is for employers to implement flexitime, which lets\nemployees travel to and from work at off-peak traffic times to avoid the rush hour.\nThose who have to travel during busy times can do their part by sharing cars. Employers\ncan also allow more staff to telecommute (work from home) so as to keep more cars off the\nroad altogether.\nD.\nSome urban planners still believe that the best way to ease traffic congestion is to build\nmore roads, especially roads that can take drivers around or over crowded city streets. But\nsuch techniques do not really keep cars off the road; they only accommodate more of\nthem.\nE.\nOther, more forward-thinking, planners know that more and more drivers and cars are\ntaking to the roads every day, and they are unwilling to encourage more private\nautomobiles when public transport is so much better both for people and the environment.\nFor this reason, the American government has decided to spend some $7 billion on helping\nto increase capacity on public transport systems and upgrade them with more efficient\ntechnologies. But environmentalists complain that such funding is tiny compared with the\n$50 billion being spent on roads and bridges. \n \n1",
