  "passage_text": "Reading Practice\n \nCollecting Ant Specimens\nCollecting ants can be as simple as picking up stray ones and placing them in a glass jar,\nor as complicated as completing an exhaustive survey of all species present in an area and\nestimating their relative abundances. The exact method used will depend on the final\npurpose of the collections. For taxonomy, or classification, long series, from a single nest,\nwhich contain all castes (workers, including majors and minors, and, if present, queens and\nmales) are desirable, to allow the determination of variation within species. For ecological\nstudies, the most important factor is collecting identifiable samples of as many of the\ndifferent species present as possible. Unfortunately, these methods are not always\ncompatible. The taxonomist sometimes overlooks whole species in favour of those groups\ncurrently under study, while the ecologist often collects only a limited number of specimens\nof each species, thus reducing their value for taxonomic investigations. \nTo collect as wide a range of species as possible, several methods must be used. These\ninclude hand collecting, using baits to attract the ants, ground litter sampling, and the\nuse of pitfall traps. Hand collecting consists of searching for ants everywhere they are\nlikely to occur. This includes on the ground, under rocks, logs or other objects on the\nground, in rotten wood on the ground or on trees, in vegetation, on tree trunks and under\nbark. When possible, collections should be made from nests or foraging columns and at\nleast 20 to 25 individuals collected. This will ensure that all individuals are of the same\nspecies, and so increase their value for detailed studies. Since some species are largely\nnocturnal, collecting should not be confined to daytime. Specimens are collected using an\naspirator (often called a pooter), forceps, a fine, moistened paint brush, or fingers, if the\nants are known not to sting. Individual insects are placed in plastic or glass tubes (1.5-3-0\nml capacity for small ants, 5-8 ml for larger ants) containing 75% to 95% ethanol. Plastic\ntubes with secure tops are better than glass because they are lighter, and do not break as\neasily if mishandled.\nBaits can be used to attract and concentrate foragers. This often increases the number of\nindividuals collected and attracts species that are otherwise elusive. Sugars and meats or\noils will attract different species and a range should be utilised. These baits can be placed\neither on the ground or on the trunks of trees or large shrubs. When placed on the ground,\nbaits should be situated on small paper cards or other flat, light-coloured surfaces, or in\ntest-tubes or vials. This makes it easier to spot ants and to capture them before they can\nescape into the surrounding leaf litter.\nMany ants are small and forage primarily in the layer of leaves and other debris on the\nground. Collecting these species by hand can be difficult. One of the most successful\nways to collect them is to gather the leaf litter in which they are foraging and extract the\nants from it. This is most commonly done by placing leaf litter on a screen over a large\nfunnel, often under some heat. As the leaf litter dries from above, ants (and other animals)\nmove downward and eventually fall out the bottom and are collected in alcohol placed\nbelow the funnel. This method works especially well in rain forests and marshy areas. A\nmethod of improving the catch when using a funnel is to sift the leaf litter through a coarse\nscreen before placing it above the funnel. This will concentrate the litter and remove larger\nleaves and twigs. It will also allow more litter to be sampled when using a limited number\nof funnels.\n \n1\n\nThe pitfall trap is another commonly used tool for collecting ants. A pitfall trap can be any\nsmall container placed in the ground with the top level with the surrounding surface\nand filled with a preservative. Ants are collected when they fall into the trap while foraging.\nThe diameter of the traps can vary from about 18 mm to 10 cm and the number used can\nvary from a few to several hundred. The size of the traps used is influenced largely\nby personal preference (although larger sizes are generally better), while the number\nwill be determined by the study being undertaken. The preservative used is usually\nethylene glycol or propylene glycol, as alcohol will evaporate quickly and the traps will dry\nout.\nOne advantage of pitfall traps is that they can be used to collect over a period of time with\nminimal maintenance and intervention. One disadvantage is that some species are\nnot collected as they either avoid the traps or do not commonly encounter them while\nforaging.\n \n2",
