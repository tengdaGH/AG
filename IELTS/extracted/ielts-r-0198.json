Helium - an inert,\nodourless, monatomic element known to lay people as the substance that makes\nballoons float and voices squeak when inhaled - could be gone from this planet within a\ngeneration.\nB Helium itself is not rare; there is actually a plentiful supply of it in the cosmos. In\nfact, 24 per cent of our galaxy’s elemental mass consists of helium, which makes it the\nsecond most abundant element in our universe. Because of its lightness, however, most\nhelium vanished from our own planet many years ago. Consequently, only a miniscule\nproportion - 0.00052%, to be exact - remains in earth’s atmosphere. Helium is the by¬\nproduct of millennia of radioactive decay from the elements thorium and uranium. The\nhelium is mostly trapped in subterranean natural gas bunkers and commercially\nextracted through a method known as fractional distillation.\nC The loss of helium on Earth would affect society greatly. Defying the perception\nof it as a novelty substance for parties and gimmicks, the element actually has many\nvital applications in society. Probably the most well known commercial usage is in\nairships and blimps (non-flammable helium replaced hydrogen as the lifting gas du jour\nafter the Hindenburg catastrophe in 1932, during which an airship burst into flames and\ncrashed to the ground killing some passengers and crew). But helium is also\ninstrumental in deep-sea diving, where it is blended with nitrogen to mitigate the dangers\nof inhaling ordinary air under high pressure; as a cleaning agent for rocket engines; and,\nin its most prevalent use, as a coolant for superconducting magnets in hospital MRI\n(magnetic resonance imaging) scanners.\nD The possibility of losing helium forever poses the threat of a real crisis because\nits unique qualities are extraordinarily difficult, if not impossible to duplicate (certainly, no\nbiosynthetic ersatz product is close to approaching the point of feasibility for helium,\neven as similar developments continue apace for oil and coal). Helium is even cheerfully\nderided as a “loner” element since it does not adhere to other molecules like its cousin,\nhydrogen. According to Dr. Lee Sobotka, helium is the “most noble of gases, meaning\nit’s very stable and non-reactive for the most part ... it has a closed electronic\nconfiguration, a very tightly bound atom. It is this coveting of its own electrons that\nprevents combination with other elements’. Another important attribute is helium’s\nunique boiling point, which is lower than that for any other element. The worsening\nglobal shortage could render millions of dollars of high-value, life-saving equipment\ntotally useless. The dwindling supplies have already resulted in the postponement of\nresearch and development projects in physics laboratories and manufacturing plants\naround the world. There is an enormous supply and demand imbalance partly brought\nabout by the expansion of high-tech manufacturing in Asia.\nE The source of the problem is the Helium Privatisation Act (HPA), an American\nlaw passed in 1996 that requires the U.S. National Helium Reserve to liquidate its helium\nassets by 2015 regardless of the market price. Although intended to settle the original\ncost of the reserve by a U.S. Congress ignorant of its ramifications, the result of this fire\n \n1\n\nsale is that global helium prices are so artificially deflated that few can be bothered\nrecycling the substance or using it judiciously. Deflated values also mean that natural\ngas extractors see no reason to capture helium. Much is lost in the process of extraction.\nAs Sobotka notes: \"[t]he government had the good vision to store helium, and the\nquestion now is: Will the corporations have the vision to capture it when extracting\nnatural gas, and consumers the wisdom to recycle? This takes long-term vision because\npresent market forces are not sufficient to compel prudent practice”. For Nobel-prize\nlaureate Robert Richardson, the U.S. government must be prevailed upon to repeal its\nprivatisation policy as the country supplies over 80 per cent of global helium, mostly from\nthe National Helium Reserve. For Richardson, a twenty- to fifty-fold increase in prices\nwould provide incentives to recycle.\nF A number of steps need to be taken in order to avert a costly predicament in the\ncoming decades. Firstly, all existing supplies of helium ought to be conserved and\nreleased only by permit, with medical uses receiving precedence over other commercial\nor recreational demands. Secondly, conservation should be obligatory and enforced by a\nregulatory agency. At the moment some users, such as hospitals, tend to recycle\ndiligently while others, such as NASA, squander massive amounts of helium. Lastly,\nresearch into alternatives to helium must begin in earnest.\n \n2",
