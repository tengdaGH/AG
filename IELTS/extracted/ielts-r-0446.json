One hundred and one cane toads arnved at Edmonton in June in 1935.\nBreeding occurred almost immediately. The cane toad is tough and adaptable, as well as\nbeing poisonous throughout Its life cycle, and has few predators in Australia.\nParagraph B\nCane toads are large heavily-built amphibians with dry, warty skin. They have a bony head\nand over their eyes are bony ndges that meet above the nose They sit upright and move in\nshort rapid hops. Their hind feet have leathery webbing between the toes and their front\nfeet are unwebbed. Adult cane toads have large swellings - the parotoid glands - on each\nshoulder behind the eardrum. Cane toads may be grey, yellowish, olive-brown or reddish-\nbrown, and their bellies are pale with dark mottling. Average-sized adults are ten to fifteen\ncentimetres long. The largest female measured in Queensland was twenty-four centimetres\nlong and weighed one point three kilograms Male cane toads are smaller and wartier than\nfemales. Dunng the breeding season males develop dark lumps (nuptial pads) on their first\ntwo fingers; these help them cling to a female while mating. Their mating call is a long loud\npurnng tnll. Cane toad spawn is exclusive in Australia. It is laid in long strings of\ntransparent jelly enclosing double rows of black eggs The spawn tangles in dense dark\nmasses around water plants, and hangs in ropy strands if picked up\nParagraph c\nThe natural range of cane toads extends from the southern United States to tropical South\nAmenca. In 2002, cane toads occurred throughout the eastern and northern half of\nQueensland and have extended their range to the river catchments surrounding Kakadu\nNational Park in the Northern Temtory. In New South Wales, they occur as far south as\nYamba and Port Macquarie.\nParagraph D\nCane toads tolerate a broad range of environmental and climatic conditions and appear to\nbe able to adjust and survive in almost any environment system, including sea water for\nshort penods of time. This to a large extent explains their success in their spreading in\nAustralia. Cane toads are found in environments ranging from sand dunes and coastal\nheath to the margins of rainforest and mangroves. They are most abundant in open\nclearings in urban areas, and in grassland and woodland.\nParagraph E\nCane toads eat almost anything they can swallow, including pet food, carrion and\nhousehold scraps, but most of their food consists of living insects Beetles, honey bees.\nants, winged termites, cnckets and bugs are eaten in abundance Marine snails, smaller\ntoads and native\nfrogs, small snakes, and small mammals are occasionally eaten by cane toads. The\ntadpoles of cane toads eat algae and other aquatic plants which they rasp off with five rows\n \n1\n\nof tiny peg-like teeth. They also filter organic matter from the water. Large tadpoles\nsometimes eat cane toad eggs\nParagraph F\nCane toads were introduced to Australia to eat French s Cane Beetle and the Greyback\nCane Beetle The whitegrub larvae of these beetles eat the roots of sugar cane and kill or\nstunt the plants. The Australian Bureau of Sugar Experimental Stations imported about a\nhundred toads from Hawaii to the Meringa Experimental Station near Cairns. The toads\nbred quickly and more than three thousand were released in the sugar cane plantations of\nnorth Queensland in July 1935. At that time, some naturalists and scientists warned of the\ndangers of liberating cane toads in Australia. Their protests resulted in a brief moratohum\non the release of toads, but releases resumed in 1936. The protestors were right. Firstly,\ncane toads compete for the resources of native animals, like food, which affects native\npopulations. Secondly, cane toads don't have as many established predators as native\nanimals and so their population grows quickly. Finally, some native animals who would\nnormally feed on frogs try to eat toads and get poisoned.\nParagraph G\nAll stages of the cane toad's life-cycle are poisonous. No humans have died in Australia\nfrom cane toad poison, but overseas, people have died after eating toads and even soup\nmade from boiled toad eggs Cane toads are also poisonous to pets. In Hawaii, up to fifty\ndogs a year have died after having cane toads in their mouths Signs of dogs being\npoisoned through ingestion include profuse salivation, twitching, vomiting, shallow\nbreathing, and collapse of the hind limbs. Death may occur by cardiac arrest within fifteen\nminutes. A cane toad responds to threat by turning side-on so Its parotoid glands are\ndirected towards the attacker. The poison usually oozes out of the glands, but toads can\nsquirt a fine spray for a short distance if they want. The poison is absorbed through mucous\nmembranes such as eyes, mouth and nose, and in humans may cause intense pain,\ntemporary blindness and inflammation\n \n2",
