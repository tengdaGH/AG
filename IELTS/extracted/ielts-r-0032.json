But in fact the social lives of some members\nof the insect kingdom are sufficiently complex to suggest more than a hint of intelligence.\nAmong these, the world of the ant has come in for considerable scrutiny lately, and the idea\nthat ants demonstrate sparks of cognition has certainly not been rejected by those involved\nin these investigations.\nAnts store food, repel attackers and use chemical signals to contact one another in case of\nattack. Such chemical communication can be compared to the human use of visual and\nauditory channels (as in religious chants, advertising images and jingles, political slogans\nand martial music) to arouse and propagate moods and attitudes. The biologist Lewis\nThomas wrote, Ants are so much like human beings as to be an embarrassment. They\nfarm fungi, raise aphids* as livestock, launch armies to war, use chemical sprays to alarm\nand confuse enemies, capture slaves, engage in child labour, exchange information\nceaselessly.

Only basic instincts are carried in the\ngenes of a newborn baby, other skills being learned from others in the community as the\nchild grows up. It may seem that this cultural continuity gives us a huge advantage\nover ants. They have never mastered fire nor progressed. Their fungus farming and\naphid herding crafts are sophisticated when compared to the agricultural skills of humans\nfive thousand years ago but have been totally overtaken by modem human agribusiness.\nOr have they? The farming methods of ants are at least sustainable. They do not\nruin environments or use enormous amounts of energy. Moreover, recent evidence\nsuggests that the crop farming of ants may be more sophisticated and adaptable than\nwas thought.\nAnts were farmers fifty million years before humans were. Ants can't digest the cellulose in\nleaves - but some fungi can. The ants therefore cultivate these fungi in their nests, bringing\nthem leaves to feed on, and then use them as a source of food. Farmer ants secrete\nantibiotics to control other fungi that might act as 'weeds’, and spread waste to fertilise the\ncrop.\nIt was once thought that the fungus that ants cultivate was a single type that they had\npropagated, essentially unchanged from the distant past. Not so. Ulrich Mueller\nof Maryland and his colleagues genetically screened 862 different types of fungi taken from\nants' nests. These turned out to be highly diverse: it seems that ants are continually\ndomesticating new species. Even more impressively, DNA analysis of the fungi suggests\nthat the ants improve or modify the fungi by regularly swapping and sharing strains with\nneighbouring ant colonies.\nWhereas prehistoric man had no exposure to urban lifestyles - the forcing house\nof intelligence - the evidence suggests that ants have lived in urban settings for close on a\nhundred million years, developing and maintaining underground cities of specialised\nchambers and tunnels.\n \n1\n\nWhen we survey Mexico City, Tokyo, Los Angeles, we are amazed at what has\nbeen accomplished by humans.
