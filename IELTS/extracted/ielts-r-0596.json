  "passage_text": "Reading Practice\n \nTwin Study: Two of a kind\nA\nTHE scientific study of twins goes back to the late 19th century, when Francis Galton, an\nearly geneticist, realised that they came in two varieties: identical twins born from one egg\nand non-identical twins that had come from two. That insight turned out to be key, although\nit was not until 1924 that it was used to formulate what is known as the twin rule of\npathology, and twin studies really got going.\nB\nThe twin rule of pathology states that any heritable disease will be more concordant (that\nis, more likely to be jointly present or absent) in identical twins than in non-identical twins –\nand, in turn, will be more concordant in non-identical twins than in non-siblings. Early work,\nfor example, showed that the statistical correlation of skin-mole counts between identical\ntwins was 0.4, while non-identical twins had a correlation of only 0.2. (A score of 1.0 implies\na perfect correlation, while a score of zero implies no correlation.) This result suggests that\nmoles are heritable, but it also implies that there is an environmental component to the\ndevelopment of moles, otherwise, the correlation in identical twins would be close to 1.0.\nC\nTwin research has shown that whether or not someone takes up smoking is determined\nmainly by environmental factors, but once he does so, how much he smokes is largely\ndown to his genes. And while a person’s religion is clearly a cultural attribute, there is a\nstrong genetic component to religious fundamentalism. Twin studies are also unraveling\nthe heritability of various aspects of human personality. Traits from neuroticism and anxiety\nto thrill – and novelty-seeking all have large genetic components. Parenting matters, but it\ndoes not determine personality in the way that some had thought.\nD\nMore importantly, perhaps, twin studies are helping the understanding of diseases such as\ncancer, asthma, osteoporosis, arthritis and immune disorders. And twins can be used,\nwithin ethical, for medical experiments. A study that administered vitamin C to one twin and\na placebo to the other found that it had no effect on the common cold. The lesson from all\nof today’s twin studies is that most human traits are at least partially influenced by genes.\nHowever, for the most part, the age-old dichotomy between nature and nurture is not very\nuseful. Many genetic programs are open to input from the environment, and genes are\nfrequently switched on or off by environmental signals. It is also possible that genes\nthemselves influence their environment. Some humans have an innate preference for\nparticipation in sports. Others are drawn to novelty. Might people also be drawn to certain\nkinds of friends and types of experience? In this way, a person’s genes might shape the\nenvironment they act in as much as the environment shapes the actions of the genes.\nE\nIn the past, such research has been controversial. Josef Mengele, a Nazi doctor working at\nthe Auschwitz extermination camp during the second world war, was fascinated by twins.\nHe sought them out among arrivals at the camp and preserved them from the gas-\n \n1\n\nchambers for a series of brutal experiments. After the war, Cyril Burt, a British psychologist\nwho worked on the heredity of intelligence, tainted twin research with results that appear, in\nretrospect, to have been rather too good. Some of his data on identical twins who had been\nreared apart were probably faked. In any case, the prevailing ideology in the social\nsciences after the war was Marxist and disliked suggestions that differences in human\npotential might have underlying genetic causes. Twin studies were thus viewed with\nsuspicion.\nF\nThe ideological pendulum has swung back; however, as the human genome project and its\naftermath have turned genes for abstract concepts to real pieces of DNA. The role of genes\nin sensitive areas such as intelligence is acknowledged by all but a few die-hards. The\ninteresting questions now concern how nature and nurture interact to produce particular\nbits of biology, rather than which of the two is more important. Twin studies, which are a\ngood way to ask these questions, are back in fashion, and many twins are enthusiastic\nparticipants in this research.\nG\nResearch at the Twinsburg festival began in a small way, with a single stand in 1979.\nGradually, news spread and more scientists began turning up. This year, half a dozen\ngroups of researchers were lodged in a specially pitched research tent. In one corner of\nthis tent, Paul Breslin, who works at the Monell Institute in Philadelphia, watched over\nseveral tables where twins sat sipping clear liquids from cups and making notes. It was the\nteam’s third year at Twinsburg. Dr Breslin and his colleagues want to find out how genes\ninfluence human perception, particularly the senses of smell and taste and those (warmth,\ncold, pain, tingle, itch and so on) that result from stimulation of the skin. Perception is an\nexample of something that is probably influenced by both genes and experience. Even\nbefore birth, people are exposed to flavours such as chocolate, garlic, mint and vanilla that\npass intact into the bloodstream, and thus to the fetus. Though it is not yet clear whether\nsuch pre-natal exposure shapes taste-perception, there is evidence that it shapes\npreferences for foods encountered later in life.\nH\nHowever, there are clearly genetic influences at work, as well – for example in the ability to\ntaste quinine. Some people experience this as intensely bitter, even when it is present at\nvery low levels. Others, whose genetic endowment is different, are less bothered by it. Twin\nstudies make this extremely clear. Within a pair of identical twins, either both, or neither,\nwill find quinine hard to swallow. Non-identical twins will agree less frequently.\nI\nOn the other side of the tent Dennis Drayna, from the National Institute on Deafness and\nOther Communication Disorders, in Maryland, was studying hearing. He wants to know\nwhat happens to sounds after they reach the ear. It is not clear, he says, whether the\nsound is processed into sensation mostly in the ear or in the brain. Dr Drayna has already\nbeen involved in a twin study which revealed that the perception of musical pitch is highly\nheritable. At Twinsburg, he is playing different words, or parts of words, into the left and\nright ears of his twinned volunteers. The composite of the two sounds that an individual\nreports hearing depends on how he processes this diverse information and that, Dr Drayna\n \n2\n\nbelieves, may well be influenced by genetics.\nJ\nElsewhere in the marquee, Peter Miraldi, of Kent State University in Ohio, was trying to find\nout whether genes affect an individual’s motivation to communicate with others. A number\nof twin studies have shown that personality and sociability are heritable, so he thinks this is\nfertile ground. And next to Mr Miraldi was a team of dermatologists from Case Western\nReserve University in Cleveland. They are looking at the development of skin disease and\nmale-pattern baldness. The goal of the latter piece of research is to find the genes\nresponsible for making men’s hair fall out.\nK\nThe busiest part of the tent, however, was the queue for forensic-science research into\nfingerprints. The origins of this study are shrouded in mystery. For many months, the\nfestival’s organisers have been convinced that the Secret Service – the American\ngovernment agency responsible for, among other things, the safety of the president – is\nbehind it. When The Economist contacted the Secret Service for more information, we\nwere referred to Steve Nash, who is chairman of the International Association for\nIdentification (IAI) and is also a detective in the scientific investigations section of the Marin\nCountry Sheriff’s Office in California. The IAI, based in Minnesota, is an organisation of\nforensic scientists from around the world. Among other things, it publishes the Journal of\nForensic Identification.\n \n3",
