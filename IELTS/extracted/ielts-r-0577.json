  "passage_text": "Reading Practice\n \nThe World Wide Web from its origins\nScience inspired the World Wide Web, and the Web has responded by changing science.\n'Information Management: A Proposal'. That was the bland title of a document written in\nMarch 1989 by a then little- known computer scientist called Tim Berners-Lee, who was\nworking at CERN, Europe’s particle physics laboratory, near Geneva. His proposal,\nmodestly called the World Wide Web, has achieved far more than anyone expected at the\ntime.\nIn fact, the Web was invented to deal with a specific problem. In the late 1980s, CERN was\nplanning one of the most ambitious scientific projects ever, the Large Hadron Collider*, or\nLHC. As the first few lines of the original proposal put it, 'Many of the discussions of the\nfuture at CERN and the LHC end with the question \"Yes, but how will we ever keep track of\nsuch a large project?\" This proposal provides an answer to such questions.\nThe Web, as everyone now knows, has many more uses than the original idea of linking\nelectronic documents about particle physics in laboratories around the world. But among all\nthe changes it has brought about, from personal social networks to political campaigning, it\nhas also transformed the business of doing science itself, as the man who invented it\nhoped it would.\nIt allows journals to be published online and links to be made from one paper to another. It\nalso permits professional scientists to recruit thousands of amateurs to give them a hand.\nOne project of this type, called GalaxyZoo, used these unpaid workers to classify one\nmillion images of galaxies into various types (spiral, elliptical and irregular). This project,\nwhich was intended to help astronomers understand how galaxies evolve, was so\nsuccessful that a successor has now been launched, to classify the brightest quarter of a\nmillion of them in finer detail. People working for a more modest project called\nHerbaria@home examine scanned images of handwritten notes about old plants stored in\nBritish museums. This will allow them to track the changes in the distribution of species in\nresponse to climate change.\nAnother new scientific application of the Web is to use it as an experimental laboratory. It is\nallowing social scientists, in particular, to do things that were previously impossible. In one\nproject, scientists made observations about the sizes of human social networks using data\nfrom Facebook. A second investigation of these networks, produced by Bernardo\nHuberman of HP Labs, Hewlett-Packard's research arm in Pato Alto, California, looked at\nTwitter, a social networking website that allows people to post short messages to long lists\nof friends.\nAt first glance, the networks seemed enormous - the 300,000 Twitterers sampled had 80\nfriends each, on average (those on Facebook had 120), but some listed up to 1,000. Closer\nstatistical inspection, however, revealed that the majority of the messages were directed at\na few specific friends. This showed that an individual's active social network is far smaller\nthan his 'clan'. Dr Huberman has also helped uncover several laws of web surfing,\nincluding the number of times an average person will go from web page to web page on a\ngiven site before giving up, and the details of the 'winner takes all' phenomenon, whereby a\nfew sites on a given subject attract most of the attention, and the rest get very little.\n \n1\n\n \n \nScientists have been good at using the Web to carry out research.
