Bich was appalled at the\npoor quality of the ballpoint pens that were available, and was also shocked at their high\ncost. However, he recognised that the ballpoint was a firmly established invention, and he\ndecided to design a cheap pen that worked well and would be commercially successful.\n \nBich went to the Biro brothers and asked them if he could use the design of their original\ninvention in one of his own pens. In return, he offered to pay them every time he sold a\npen. Then, for two years, Bich studied the detailed construction of every ballpoint pen that\nwas being sold, often working with a microscope.\n \nBy 1950, he was ready to introduce his new wonder: a plastic pen with a clear barrel that\nwrote smoothly, did not leak and only cost a few cents. He called it the 'Bic Cristal'. The\nballpoint pen had finally become a practical writing instrument. The public liked it\nimmediately, and today it is as common as the pencil. In Britain, they are still called Biros,\nand many Bic models also say 'Biro' on the side of the pen, to remind people of their\noriginal inventors.\nBich became extremely wealthy thanks to his invention, which had worldwide appeal. Over\nthe next 60 years his company, Societe Bic, opened factories all over the world and\nexpanded its range of inexpensive products. Today, Bic is as famous for its lighters and\nrazors as it is for its pens, and you can even buy a Bic mobile phone.\n \n1\n\n \n2",
