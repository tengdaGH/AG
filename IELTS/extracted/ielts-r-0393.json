  "passage_text": "Reading Practice\n \nSir Francis Ronalds and Telegraph\nA. RONALDS, Sir FRANCIS (1788-1873), inventor of the electric telegraph and\nmeteorologist, son of Francis Ronalds, a London merchant, and of his wife, Jane,\ndaughter of William Field, was born in London on 21 Feb. 1788. Ronalds was\neducated at a private school at Cheshunt by the Rev. E. Cogan. At an early age he\ndisplayed a taste for experiment, and he acquired great skill later in practical\nmechanics and draughtsman ship. Under the influence of Jean Andre de Luc (1727-\n1817), whose acquaintance he made in 1814, he began to devote himself to practical\nelectricity. In 1814 and 1815 he published several papers on electricity in Tilloch’s\n'Philosophical Magazine,' one of which records an ingenious use of De Luc's 'electric\ncolumn' as a motive power for a clock.\nB. Ronalds's name is chiefly remembered as the inventor of an electric telegraph. Since\n1753, when the first proposal for an electric telegraph worked by statical electricity\nwas made by a writer signing 'C. ' (said to be Charles Morrison) in the 'Scots\nMagazine', successive advances had been made abroad by Volta, Le Sage, Lomond,\nCavallo, Salva, and others; but much was needed to perfect the invention.\nC. In 1816 Francis Ronalds, then living at Upper Mall, Hammersmith, built in his back\ngarden two frames to accommodate eight miles of wire for his new invention of an\nelectrostatic telegraph. It used clockwork-driven rotating dials, engraved with letters\nof the alphabet and numbers, synchronized with each other, at both ends of the\ncircuit. For the past three or four years, encouraged by the octogenarian Swiss\nmeteorologist, Jean Andre De Luc, Ronalds had been enthusiastically experimenting\nwith electrostatic clockwork devices. When someone desired to send a message he\nearthed the wire at his end at the moment when the dial indicated the desired letter.\nAt the receiving end the pith balls would fall together when earthed and the recipient\nnoted the letter showing on his dial at that moment. The system was slow and\ndepended on the two dials staying in step, but Ronalds successfully transmitted and\nreceived letters over 150 meters of wire ; later he succeeded in sending messages\nthrough eight miles of iron wire suspended above his garden in London.\nD. After sending messages along his wires on the frame, he developed another version\nin which the wires were enclosed in glass tubes buried in the ground. At each end of\nthe line a clockwork mechanism turned synchronously revolving discs with letters on\nthem. A frictional-electricity machine kept the wire continuously charged, while at\neach end two pith balls hung from the wire on silk threads, and since they were\nsimilarly charged from the wire they stayed apart. Ronalds 'S instrument was of real\npractical use, and the brilliant idea of using synchronously rotating discs, now\nemployed in the Hughes printing apparatus, was entirely his own. The only defect in\nhis invention was the comparative slowness with which a succession of symbols\ncould be transmitted.\nE.\ntelegraph would work over distances of 800km. In the same year, Ronalds wrote to\noffer his invention to the Admiralty. In fact, in 1806, Ralph Wedgwood submitted a\nWith communications between London and Portsmouth in mind, he believed his\n \n1\n\ntelegraph based on frictional electricity to the Admiralty, but was told that the\nsemaphore was sufficient for the country. In a pamphlet he suggested the\nestablishment of a telegraph system with public offices in different centers. Francis\nRonalds, in 1816, brought a similar telegraph of his invention to the notice of the\nAdmiralty, and was politely informed that 'telegraphs of any kind are now wholly\nunnecessary.' John Barrow, Secretary to the Admiralty, replied that \"Telegraphs of\nany kind are now wholly unnecessary; and no other than the one now in use will be\nadopted.\" (The one in use was a semaphore system. Only a year after the end of the\nNapoleonic Wars, the Admiralty saw no need for improved communications, even\nthough the semaphore was usable only in daylight and good weather.\nF. After this disappointment, Ronalds set off for the continent. He travelled throughout\nEurope and the Eastern Mediterranean, taking notes, sketching and collecting\nscientific books between 1816 and 1823. He had begun collecting his large library of\nworks on electricity and kindred subjects. The last activity formed the beginnings of\nthe Ronalds Library, left in trust to the IEE (now the IET) after his death. In a small\npamphlet published in 1823, Ronalds described his invention and listed some of its\npossible uses, \"Why should not government govern at Portsmouth almost as promptly\nas in Downing Street? Why should our defaulters escape by default of our foggy\nclimate? Let US have Electrical Conversazione offices communicating with each\nother all over the kingdom if we can.\" In 1825 he invented and patented a perspective\ntracing instrument, intended to facilitate drawing from nature, which he improved\nabout 1828, and described in a work called 'Mechanical Perspective.' These\ninstruments seem to be the only ones for which he took out patents.\nG. However, Ronalds never patented his invention in electric telegraph. Ronalds seems\nto have made few or no practical contributions to science. In the meanwhile, one\nperson did benefit from this work-Charles Wheatstone who saw the telegraph as a\nboy. When Charles Wheatstone was quite a child, his father had seen the Ronalds\ntelegraph at work. Later, the invention of an electric telegraph had been marvelously\ndeveloped by Wheatstone, who had seen many of the Hammersmith experiments, in\nconjunction with Mr. William Fothergill Cooke, and these two men together devised\nand patented in 1837 the first electric telegraph used publicly and commercially in\nEngland. When, in 1855, a controversy arose between Wheatstone and Cooke with\nregard to their respective shares in the invention, Wheatstone at once acknowledged\nhis direct debt to Ronalds, and Cooke, though less fully, acknowledged the priority of\nRonalds's work; Until 1855 Ronalds's share in the invention had been forgotten by\nthe public.\nH.\nMeteorological Observatory, which was then established at Kew by the British\nAssociation for the Advancement of Science.
