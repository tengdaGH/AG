  "passage_text": "Reading Practice\n \nSo you think humans are unique\nThere was a time when we thought humans were special in so many ways. Now we know\nbetter. We are not the only species that feels emotions, empathises with others or abides\nby a moral code. Neither are we the only ones with personalities, cultures and the ability to\ndesign and use tools. Yet we have steadfastly clung to the notion that one attribute, at\nleast, makes us unique: we alone have the capacity for language.\nAlas, it turns out we are not so special in this respect either. Key to the revolutionary\nreassessment of our talent for communication is the way we think about language itself.\nWhere once it was seen as a monolith, a discrete and singular entity, today scientists find it\nis more productive to think of language as a suite of abilities. Viewed this way, it becomes\napparent that the component parts of language are not as unique as the whole.\nTake gesture, arguably the starting point for language. Until recently, it was considered\nuniquely human - but not any more. Mike Tomasello of the Max Planck Institute for\nEvolutionary Anthropology in Leipzig, Germany, and others have compiled a list of gestures\nobserved in monkeys, gibbons, gorillas, chimpanzees, bonobos and orang-utans, which\nreveals that gesticulation plays a large role in their communication. Ape gestures can\ninvolve touch, vocalising or eye movement, and individuals wait until they have another\nape’s attention before making visual or auditory gestures. If their gestures go\nunacknowledged, they will often repeat them or touch the recipient.\nIn an experiment carried out in 2006 by Erica Cartmill and Richard Byrne from the\nUniversity of St Andrews in the UK, they got a person to sit on a chair with some highly\ndesirable food such as banana to one side of them and some bland food such as celery to\nthe other. The orang-utans, who could see the person and the food from their enclosures,\ngestured at their human partners to encourage them to push the desirable food their way. If\nthe person feigned incomprehension and offered the bland food, the animals would change\ntheir gestures - just as humans would in a similar situation. If the human seemed to\nunderstand while being somewhat confused, giving only half the preferred food, the apes\nwould repeat and exaggerate their gestures - again in exactly the same way a human\nwould. Such findings highlight the fact that the gestures of nonhuman primates are not\nmerely innate reflexes but are learned, flexible and under voluntary control - all\ncharacteristics that are considered prerequisites for human-like communication. As well as\ngesturing, pre-linguistic infants babble. At about five months, babies start to make their first\nspeech sounds, which some researchers believe contain a random selection of all the\nphonemes humans can produce. But as children learn the language of their parents, they\nnarrow their sound repertoire to fit the model to which they are exposed, producing just the\nsounds of their native language as well as its classic intonation patterns. Indeed, they lose\ntheir polymath talents so effectively that they are ultimately unable to produce some sounds\n- think about the difficulty some speakers have producing the English th.\nDolphin calves also pass through a babbling phase, Laurance Doyle from the SETI Institute\nin Mountain View, California, Brenda McCowan from the University of California at Davis\nand their colleagues analysed the complexity of baby dolphin sounds and found it looked\nremarkably like that of babbling infants, in that the young dolphins had a much wider\nrepertoire of sound than adults. This suggests that they practise the sounds of their\n \n1\n\nspecies, much as human babies do, before they begin to put them together in the way\ncharacteristic of mature dolphins of their species.\nOf course, language is more than mere sound - it also has meaning. While the traditional,\ncartoonish version of animal communication renders it unclear, unpredictable and\ninvoluntary, it has become clear that various species are able to give meaning to particular\nsounds by connecting them with specific ideas. Dolphins use 'signature whistles’, so called\nbecause it appears that they name themselves. Each develops a unique moniker within the\nfirst year of life and uses it whenever it meets another dolphin.\nOne of the clearest examples of animals making connections between specific sounds and\nmeanings was demonstrated by Klaus Zuberbuhler and Katie Slocombe of the University of\nSt Andrews in the UK. They noticed that chimps at Edinburgh Zoo appeared to make\nrudimentary references to objects by using distinct cries when they came across different\nkinds of food. Highly valued foods such as bread would elicit high- pitched grunts, less\nappealing ones, such as an apple, got low-pitched grunts. Zuberbuhler and Slocombe\nshowed not only that chimps could make distinctions in the way they vocalised about food,\nbut that other chimps understood what they meant, When played recordings of grunts that\nwere produced for a specific food, the chimps looked in the place where that food was\nusually found. They also searched longer if the cry had signalled a prized type of food.\nClearly animals do have greater talents for communication than we realised. Humans are\nstill special, but it is a far more graded, qualified kind of special than it used to be.\n \n2",
