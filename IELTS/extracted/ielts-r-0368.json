  "passage_text": "Reading Practice\n \nRenewable Energy\nAn insight into the progress in renewable energy research\nA\nThe race is on for the ultimate goal of renewable energy: electricity production at prices that\nare competitive with coal-fired power stations, but without coal’s pollution. Some new\ntechnologies are aiming to be the first to push coal from its position as Australia’s chief\nsource of electricity.\nB\nAt the moment the front-runner in renewable energy is wind technology. According to Peter\nBergin of Australian Hydro, one of Australia’s leading wind energy companies, there have\nbeen no dramatic changes in windmill design for many years, but the cumulative effects of\nnumerous small improvements have had a major impact on cost. ‘We’re reaping the\nbenefits of 30 years of research in Europe, without have to make the same mistakes that\nthey did,’ Mr Bergin says.\nC\nElectricity can be produced from coal at around 4 cents per kilowatt-hour, but only if the\nenvironmental costs are ignored. ‘Australia has the second cheapest electricity in the world,\nand this makes it difficult for renewable to compete,’ says Richard Hunter of the Australian\nEcogeneration Association (AEA). Nevertheless, the AEA reports: ‘The production cost of a\nkilowatt-hour of wind power is one-fifth of what it was 20 years ago,’ or around 7 cents per\nkilowatt-hour.\nD\nAustralian Hydro has dozens of wind monitoring stations across Australia as part of its aim\nto become Australia’s pre-eminent renewable energy company. Despite all these\ndevelopments, wind power remains one of the few forms of alternative energy where\nAustralia is nowhere near the global cutting edge, mostly just replicating European designs.\nE\nWhile wind may currently lead the way, some consider a number of technologies under\ndevelopment have more potential. In several cases, Australia is at the forefront of global\nresearch in the area. Some of them are very site-specific, ensuring that they may never\nbecome dominant market players. On the other hand, these newer developments are\ncapable of providing more reliable power, avoiding the major criticism of windmills – the\nneed for back-up on a calm day.\nF\nOne such development uses hot, dry rocks. Deep beneath South Australia, radiation from\nelements contained in granite heats the rocks. Layers of insulating sedimentation raise the\ntemperatures in some location to 250° centigrade. An Australian firm, Geoenergy, is\nproposing to pump water 3.5 kilometres into the earth, where it will travel through tiny\nfissures in the granite, heating up as it goes until it escapes as steam through another\n \n1\n\ndrilled hole.\nG\nNo greenhouse gases are produced, but the system needs some additional features if it is\nto be environmentally friendly. Dr Prue Chopra, a geophysicist at the Australian National\nUniversity and one of the founders of Geoenergy, note that the steam will bring with it\nradon gas, along through a heat exchanger and then sent back underground for another\ncycle. Technically speaking, hot dry rocks are not a renewable source of energy. However,\nthe Australian source is so large it could supply the entire country’s needs for thousands of\nyears at current rates of consumption.\nH\nTwo other proposals for very different ways to harness sun and wind energy have surfaced\nrecently. Progress continues with Australian company EnviroPower’s plans for Australia’s\nfirst solar chimney near Mildura, in Victoria. Under this scheme, a tall tower will draw hot air\nfrom a greenhouse built to cover the surrounding 5 km². As the air rises, it will drive a\nturbine* to produce electricity. The solar tower combines three very old technologies – the\nchimney, the turbine and the greenhouse – to produce something quite new. It is this\nreliance on proven engineering principles that led Enviropower’s CEO, Richard Davies, to\nstate: There is no doubt this technology will work, none at all.’\nI\nThis year, Enviropower recognized that the quality of sunlight in the Mildura district will\nrequire a substantially larger collecting area than was previously thought. However,\nspokesperson kay Firth says that a new location closer to Mildura will enable Enviropower\nto balance the increased costs with extra revenue. Besides saving in transmission costs,\nthe new site ‘will mean increased revenue from tourism and use of power for\ntelecommunications. We’ll also be able to use the outer 500 metres for agribusiness.’ Wind\nspeeds closer to the tower will be too high for farming.\nJ\nAnother Australian company, Wavetech, is achieving success with ways of harvesting the\nenergy in waves. Wavetech’s invention uses a curved surface to push waves into a\nchamber, where the flowing water column pushes air back and forth through a turbine.\nWavetech was created when Dr Tim Devine offered the idea to the world leader in wave\ngenerator manufacturers, who rather surprisingly rejected it. Dr Devine responded by\nestablishing Wavetech and making a number of other improvements to generator design.\nWavetech claims that, at appropriate sites, ‘the cost of electricity produced with our\ntechnology should be below 4 cents per kilowatt-hour.\nK\nThe diversity of forms of greenhouse – friendly energy under development in Australia is\nremarkable. However, support on a national level is disappointing. According to Richard\nHunter of the AEA, ‘Australia has huge potential for wind, sun and wave technology. We\nshould really be at the forefront, but the reality is we are a long way behind.’\n \n2",
