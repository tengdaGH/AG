  "passage_text": "Reading Practice\n \nTHE MPEMBA EFFECT\nIn 300 BC, the famous philosopher Aristotle wrote about a strange phenomenon that he\nhad observed: “Many people, when they want to cool water quickly, begin by putting it in\nthe sun.” Other philosophers over the ages noted the same result, but were unable to\nexplain it.\nIn 1963, a young Tanzanian student named Erasto Mpemba noticed that the ice cream he\nwas making froze faster if the mix was placed in the freezer while warm than if it were at\nroom temperature. He persisted in questioning why this occurred, and eventually physicist\nDenis Osborne began a serious investigation into what is now known as the Mpemba\nEffect. He and Mpemba co-authored a paper in New Scientist in 1969, which produced\nscientific descriptions of some of the many factors at work in freezing water.\nIt was initially hypothesised that the warm bowl melted itself a place in the ice on the\nfreezer shelf, thus embedding its base in a ‘nest’ of ice, which would accelerate freezing.\nThe hypothesis was tested by comparing the result when bowls of warm water were placed\non ice and on a dry wire shelf; this demonstrated that the ice nest actually had little effect.\nA second suggestion was that the warmer water would be evaporating at its surface, thus\nreducing the volume needing to be frozen, but this idea was also shown to be insignificant.\nThermometers placed in the water showed that the cooler water dropped to freezing\ntemperature well before the warmer bowlful, and yet the latter always froze solid first.\nExperiments at different temperatures showed that water at 50C took longest to freeze in a\nconventional freezer, while water initially at 350C was quickest. On further examination, an\nexplanation for this paradox began to emerge. Losing heat from the water occurs at the\npoints where it is in touch with the colder atmosphere of the freezer, namely the sides of\nthe bowl and the water surface.\nA warm surface will lose heat faster than a cold one because of the contrast between the\ntemperatures; but of course there is more heat to be lost from one bowl than the other! If\nthe surface can be kept at a higher temperature, the higher rate of heat loss will continue.\nAs long as the water remains liquid, the cooling portion on top will sink to the bottom of the\nbowl as the warmer water below rises to take its place. The early freezing that may occur\non the sides and base of the container will amplify the effect.\nThe bowl that is more uniformly cold will have far less temperature difference so the water\nflow will be minimal. Another inhibiting factor for this container is that ice will also form quite\nquickly on the surface. This not only acts as insulation, but will virtually stop the helpful\neffects of the water circulating inside the bowl.\nUltimately, the rate of cooling the core of this body of water becomes so slow that the other\nwarmer one is always fully frozen first. While there are limitations to this comparison (for\nexample, we would not see such a result if one quantity were at 10C and another at 990C)\nthis counter-intuitive result does hold true within the 5–350C range of temperatures\nindicated previously.\nSince this paper was published, the validity of the research findings has been questioned\nby a number of reviewers. They point out that the initial experimental question was not\nclearly defined; for example, the researchers needed to decide on exactly what constituted\n \n1\n\nfreezing the water. They also state that the rate at which water freezes depends on a large\nnumber of variables.\nContainer size is one of these; for the Mpemba Effect to be noticed, the container must be\nlarge enough to allow a free circulation of water to take place, yet small enough for the\nfreezing areas of the side and base to be effective at extracting heat too. Secondly,\nresearch at a University in St Louis, Missouri, suggests that the Mpemba Effect may be\naffected by water purity, or by dissolved gas in the water.\nDistilled water is totally free of the particles that are common in normal drinking water or\nmineral water. When suspended in water, these particles may have a small effect on the\nspeed of cooling, especially as ice molecules tend to expel them into the surrounding\nwater, where they become more concentrated. Just as salt dissolved in water will raise the\nboiling point and lower the temperature at which it freezes, the researchers found that the\nfinal portion of ordinary water needed extra cooling, below zero, before all was frozen solid.\n \nOne more factor that can distort the effect is observed if the bowls are not placed\nsimultaneously into the same freezer. In this case, the freezer thermostat is more likely to\nregister the presence of a hotter bowl than a colder one, and therefore the change in\ninternal temperature causes a boost of freezing power as the motor is activated.\nThe Mpemba Effect is still not fully understood, and researchers continue to delve into its\nunderlying physics. Physicists cannot reach consensus. Some suggest that supercooling1\nis involved; others that the molecular bonds in the water molecules affect the rate of cooling\nand freezing of water. A 2013 competition to explain the phenomenon run by the Royal\nSociety of Chemistry attracted more than 22,000 entries, with the winning one suggesting\nsupercooling as an important factor so it seems the question and its underlying explanation\ncontinue to fascinate.\n \n2",
