  "passage_text": "Reading Practice\n \n \nHow war debris could cause cancer\n \nA Could the mystery over how depleted uranium might cause genetic damage be closer to\nbeing solved? It may be, if a controversial claim by two researchers is right. They say that\nminute quantities of the material lodged in the body may kick out energetic electrons that\nmimic the effect of beta radiation. This, they argue, could explain how residues of depleted\nuranium scattered across former war zones could be increasing the risk of cancers and\nother problems among soldiers and local people. \n \nB Depleted uranium is highly valued by the military, who use it in the tips of armourpiercing\nweapons. The material’s high density and self-sharpening properties help it to penetrate\nthe armour of enemy tanks and bunkers. Its use in conflicts has risen sharply in recent\nyears. The UN Environment Programme (UNEP) estimates that shells containing 1700\ntonnes of the material were fired during the 2003 Iraq war. Some researchers and\ncampaigners are convinced that depleted uranium left in the people exposed to it.\nGovernments and the military disagree, and point out that there is no conclusive\nepidemiological evidence for this. And while they acknowledge that the material is weakly\nradioactive, they say this effect is too small to explain the genetic damage at the levels\nseen in war veterans and civilians.\n \nC Organisations such as the UK’s Royal Society, the US Department of Veterans Affairs\nand UNEP have called for more comprehensive epidemiological studies to clarify the link\nbetween depleted uranium and any ill effects. Meanwhile, various testtube and animal\nstudies have suggested that depleted uranium may increase the risk of cancer, according\nto a review of the scientific literature published in May 2008 by the US National Research\nCouncil. The authors of the NRC report argue that more long-term and quantitative\nresearch is needed on the effects of uranium’s chemical toxicity. They say the science\nseems to support the theory that genetic damage might be occurring because uranium’s\nchemical toxicity and weak radioactivity could somehow reinforce each other, though no\none knows what the mechanism for this might be.\nD Now two researchers, Chris Busby and Ewald Schnug, have a new theory that they say\nexplains how depleted uranium could cause genetic damage. Their theory invokes a well-\nknown process called the photoelectric effect. This is the main mechanism by\nwhich gamma photons with energies of about 100 kiloelectronvolts (keV) or less are\nblocked by matter: the photon transfers its energy to an electron in the atom’s electron\ncloud, which is ejected into the surroundings.\n \nAn atom’s ability to stop photons by this mechanism depends on the fourth power of its\natomic number - the number of protons in its nucleus - so heavy elements are far better at\nintercepting gamma radiation and X-rays than light elements. This means that uranium\ncould be especially effective at capturing photons and kicking out damaging\nphotoelectrons: with an atomic number of 92, uranium blocks low-energy gamma photons\nover 450 times as effectively as the lighter element calcium, for instance.\nE Busby and Schnug say that previous risk models have ignored this well-established\nphysical effect. They claim that depleted uranium could be kicking out photoelectrons in the\nbody’s most vulnerable spots. Various studies have shown that dissolved uranium -\ningested in food or water, for example - is liable to attach to DNA strands within cells,\nbecause uranium binds strongly to DNA phosphate. “Photoelectrons from uranium are\n \n1\n\n \ntherefore likely to be emitted precisely where they will cause most damage to genetic\nmaterial,” says Busby.\n \nBusby and Schnug base their claim on calculations of the photoelectrons that would be\nproduced by the interation between normal background levels of gamma radiation and\nuranium in the body. “Our detailed calculations indicate that the phantom photoelectrons\nare the predominant effect by far for uranium genome toxicity, and that uranium could be\n1500 times as powerful as an emitter of photoelectrons than as an alpha emitter.” Their\ncomputer modelling results are described in a peer-reviewed paper to be published in this\nmonth by the IPNSS in a book called Loads and Fate of Fertiliser Derived Uranium.\n \nG Hans-Georg Menzel, who chairs the International Commission on Radiological\nProtection’s committee on radiation doses, acknowledges that the theory should be\nconsidered, but he doubts that it will prove significant. He suspects that under normal\nbackground radiation the effect is too weak to inflict many of the “double hits” of energy that\nare known to be most damaging to cells. “It is very unlikely that individual cells would be\nsubject to two or more closely spaced photoelectron impacts under normal background\ngamma irradiation,” he says. Despite his doubts, Menzel raised the issue last week with his\ncommittee in St Petersburg, Russia, and says that several colleagues “intended to collect\nrelevant data and perform calculations to check whether there was any possibility of a real\neffect in living tissues”. Organisations in the UK, including the Ministry of Defence and the\nHealth Protection Agency, say they have no plans to investigate Busby’s hypothesis.\nH Radiation biophysicist Mark Hill of the University of Oxford would like to see a fuller\ninvestigation, though he suggests this might show that the photoelectric effect is not as\npowerful as Busby claims. “We really need more detailed calculations and dose estimates\nfor realistic situations with and without uranium present,” he says. Hill’s doubts centre on an\neffect called Compton scattering, which he believes needs to be factored into any\ncalculations. With Compton scattering, uranium is only 4.5 times as effective as calcium at\nstopping gamma photons, so Hill says that taking it into account would reduce the relative\nimportance of uranium as an emitter of secondary electrons. If he is right, this would dilute\nthe mechanism proposed by Busby and Schnug.\nI The arguments over depleted uranium are likely to continue, whatever the outcome of\nthese experiments. Whether Busby’s theory holds up or not remains to be seen, but\ninvestigating it can only help to clear up some of the doubts about this mysterious\nsubstance.\n \n2",
