  "passage_text": "Reading Practice\n \nMuseums of fine art and their public\nThe fact that people go to the Louvre museum in Paris to see the original painting\nMona Lisa when they can see a reproduction anywhere leads us to question some\n \nassumptions about the role of museums of fine art in today’s world\nOne of the most famous works of art in the world is Leonardo da Vinci’s Mona Lisa. Nearly\neveryone who goes to see the original will already be familiar with it from reproductions, but\nthey accept that fine art is more rewardingly viewed in its original form.\nHowever, if Mona Lisa was a famous novel, few people would bother to go to a museum to\nread the writer’s actual manuscript rather than a printed reproduction. This might be\nexplained by the fact that the novel has evolved precisely because of technological\ndevelopments that made it possible to print out huge numbers of texts, whereas oil\npaintings have always been produced as unique objects. In addition, it could be argued that\nthe practice of interpreting or ‘reading’ each medium follows different conventions. With\nnovels, the reader attends mainly to the meaning of words rather than the way they are\nprinted on the page, whereas the ‘reader’ of a painting must attend just as closely to the\nmaterial form of marks and shapes in the picture as to any ideas they may signify.\nYet it has always been possible to make very accurate facsimiles of pretty well any fine art\nwork. The seven surviving versions of Mona Lisa bear witness to the fact that in the 16th\ncentury, artists seemed perfectly content to assign the reproduction of their creations to\ntheir workshop apprentices as regular ‘bread and butter’ work. And today the task of\nreproducing pictures is incomparably more simple and reliable, with reprographic\ntechniques that allow the production of high-quality prints made exactly to the original\nscale, with faithful colour values, and even with duplication of the surface relief of the\npainting.\nBut despite an implicit recognition that the spread of good reproductions can be culturally\nvaluable, museums continue to promote the special status of original work.\nUnfortunately, this seems to place severe limitations on the kind of experience offered to\nvisitors.\nOne limitation is related to the way the museum presents its exhibits. As repositories of\nunique historical objects, art museums are often called ‘treasure houses’. We are reminded\nof this even before we view a collection by the presence of security guards, attendants,\nropes and display cases to keep us away from the exhibits. In many cases, the\narchitectural style of the building further reinforces that notion. In addition, a major\ncollection like that of London’s National Gallery is housed in numerous rooms, each with\ndozens of works, any one of which is likely to be worth more than all the average visitor\npossesses. In a society that judges the personal status of the individual so much by their\nmaterial worth, it is therefore difficult not to be impressed by one’s own relative\n‘worthlessness’ in such an environment.\nFurthermore, consideration of the ‘value’ of the original work in its treasure house setting\nimpresses upon the viewer that, since these works were originally produced, they have\nbeen assigned a huge monetary value by some person or institution more powerful than\nthemselves. Evidently, nothing the viewer thinks about the work is going to alter that value,\n \n1\n\nand so today’s viewer is deterred from trying to extend that spontaneous, immediate, self-\nreliant kind of reading which would originally have met the work.\nThe visitor may then be struck by the strangeness of seeing such diverse paintings,\ndrawings and sculptures brought together in an environment for which they were not\noriginally created. This ‘displacement effect’ is further heightened by the sheer volume of\nexhibits. In the case of a major collection, there are probably more works on display than\nwe could realistically view in weeks or even months.\nThis is particularly distressing because time seems to be a vital factor in the appreciation of\nall art forms. A fundamental difference between paintings and other art forms is that there\nis no prescribed time over which a painting is viewed. By contrast, the audience encourage\nan opera or a play over a specific time, which is the duration of the performance. Similarly\nnovels and poems are read in a prescribed temporal sequence, whereas a picture has no\nclear place at which to start viewing, or at which to finish. Thus art works themselves\nencourage us to view them superficially, without appreciating the richness of detail and\nlabour that is involved.\nConsequently, the dominant critical approach becomes that of the art historian, a\nspecialised academic approach devoted to ‘discovering the meaning’ of art within the\ncultural context of its time. This is in perfect harmony with the museum s function, since the\napproach is dedicated to seeking out and conserving ‘authentic’, original, readings of the\nexhibits. Again, this seems to put paid to that spontaneous, participators criticism which\ncan be found in abundance in criticism of classic works of literature, but is absent from\nmost art history.\nThe displays of art museums serve as a warning of what critical practices can emerge\nwhen spontaneous criticism is suppressed. The museum public, like any other audience,\nexperience art more rewardingly when given the confidence to express their views. If\nappropriate works of fine art could be rendered permanently accessible to the public by\nmeans of high-fidelity reproductions, as literature and music already are, the public may\nfeel somewhat less in awe of them. Unfortunately, that may be too much to ask from those\nwho seek to maintain and control the art establishment.\n \n2",
