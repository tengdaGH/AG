  "passage_text": "Reading Practice\n \nMaking Every Drop Count\nA\nThe history of human civilisation is entwined with the history of the ways we have learned\nto manipulate water resources. As towns gradually expanded, water was brought from\nincreasingly remote sources, leading to sophisticated engineering efforts such as dams and\naqueducts. At the height of the Roman Empire, nine major systems, with an innovative\nlayout of pipes and well-built sewers, supplied the occupants of Rome with as much water\nper person as is provided in many parts of the industrial world today.\nB\nDuring the industrial revolution and population explosion of the 19th and 20th centuries, the\ndemand for water rose dramatically. Unprecedented construction of tens of thousands of\nmonumental engineering projects designed to control floods, protect clean water supplies,\nand provide water for irrigation and hydropower brought great benefits to hundreds of\nmillions of people. Food production has kept pace with soaring populations mainly because\nof the expansion of artificial irrigation systems that make possible the growth of 40 % of the\nworld’s food. Nearly one fifth of all the electricity generated worldwide is produced by\nturbines spun by the power of falling water.\nC\nYet there is a dark side to this picture: despite our progress, half of the world’s population\nstill suffers, with water services inferior to those available to the ancient Greeks and\nRomans. As the United Nations report on access to water reiterated in November 2001,\nmore than one billion people lack access to clean drinking water; some two and a half\nbillion do not have adequate sanitation services. Preventable water-related diseases kill an\nestimated 10,000 to 20,000 children every day, and the latest evidence suggests that we\nare falling behind in efforts to solve these problems.\nD\nThe consequences of our water policies extend beyond jeopardising human health. Tens of\nmillions of people have been forced to move from their homes - often with little warning or\ncompensation - to make way for the reservoirs behind dams. More than 20 % of all\nfreshwater fish species are now threatened or endangered because dams and water\nwithdrawals have destroyed the free-flowing river ecosystems where they thrive. Certain\nirrigation practices degrade soil quality and reduce agricultural productivity. Groundwater\naquifers* are being pumped down faster than they are naturally replenished in parts of\nIndia, China, the USA and elsewhere. And disputes over shared water resources have led\nto violence and continue to raise local, national and even international tensions.\n*underground stores of water\nE\nAt the outset of the new millennium, however, the way resource planners think about water\nis beginning to change. The focus is slowly shifting back to the provision of basic human\nand environmental needs as top priority - ensuring ‘some for all,’ instead of ‘more for\n \n1\n\nsome’. Some water experts are now demanding that existing infrastructure be used in\nsmarter ways rather than building new facilities, which is increasingly considered the option\nof last, not first, resort. This shift in philosophy has not been universally accepted, and it\ncomes with strong opposition from some established water organisations. Nevertheless, it\nmay be the only way to address successfully the pressing problems of providing everyone\nwith clean water to drink, adequate water to grow food and a life free from preventable\nwater-related illness.\nF\nFortunately - and unexpectedly - the demand for water is not rising as rapidly as some\npredicted. As a result, the pressure to build new water infrastructures has diminished over\nthe past two decades. Although population, industrial output and economic productivity\nhave continued to soar in developed nations, the rate at which people withdraw water from\naquifers, rivers and lakes has slowed. And in a few parts of the world, demand has actually\nfallen.\nG\nWhat explains this remarkable turn of events? Two factors: people have figured out how to\nuse water more efficiently, and communities are rethinking their priorities for water use.\nThroughout the first three-quarters of the 20th century, the quantity of freshwater\nconsumed per person doubled on average; in the USA, water withdrawals increased\ntenfold while the population quadrupled. But since 1980, the amount of water consumed\nper person has actually decreased, thanks to a range of new technologies that help to\nconserve water in homes and industry. In 1965, for instance, Japan used approximately 13\nmillion gallons* of water to produce $1 million of commercial output; by 1989 this had\ndropped to 3.5 million gallons (even accounting for inflation) - almost a quadrupling of water\nproductivity. In the USA, water withdrawals have fallen by more than 20 % from their peak\nin 1980.\nH\nOn the other hand, dams, aqueducts and other kinds of infrastructure will still have to be\nbuilt, particularly in developing countries where basic human needs have not been met. But\nsuch projects must be built to higher specifications and with more accountability to local\npeople and their environment than in the past. And even in regions where new projects\nseem warranted, we must find ways to meet demands with fewer resources, respecting\necological criteria and to a smaller budget.\n* 1 gallon: 4.546 litres\n \n2",
