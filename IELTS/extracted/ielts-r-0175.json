  "passage_text": "Reading Practice\n \nGeoff Brash\nGeoff Brash, who died in 2010, was a gregarious Australian businessman and\nphilanthropist who encouraged the young to reach their potential.\nBorn in Melbourne to Elsa and Alfred Brash, he was educated at Scotch College. His sister,\nBarbara, became a renowned artist and printmaker. His father, Alfred, ran the Brash retail\nmusic business that had been founded in 1862 by his grandfather, the German immigrant\nMarcus Brasch, specialising in pianos. It carried the slogan ‘A home is not a home without\na piano.’\nIn his young days, Brash enjoyed the good life, playing golf and sailing, and spending some\nmonths travelling through Europe, having a leisurely holiday. He worked for a time at Myer\ndepartment stores before joining the family business in 1949, where he quickly began to\nput his stamp on things. In one of his first management decisions, he diverged from his\nfather’s sense of frugal aesthetics by re-carpeting the old man’s office while he was away.\nAfter initially complaining of his extravagance, his father grew to accept the change and\ngave his son increasing responsibility in the business.\nAfter World War II (1939-1945), Brash’s had begun to focus on white goods, such as\nwashing machines and refrigerators, as the consumer boom took hold. However, while his\nfather was content with the business he had built, the younger Brash viewed expansion as\nvital. When Geoff Brash took over as managing director in 1957, the company had two\nstores, but after floating it on the stock exchange the following year, he expanded rapidly\nand opened suburban stores, as well as buying into familiar music industry names such as\nAllans, Palings and Suttons. Eventually, 170 stores traded across the continent under the\nBrash’s banner.\nGeoff Brash learned from his father’s focus on customer service. Alfred Brash had also\nbeen a pioneer in introducing a share scheme for his staff, and his son retained and\nexpanded the plan following the float.\nGeoff Brash was optimistic and outward looking. As a result, he was a pioneer in both\naccessing and selling new technology, and developing overseas relationships. He sourced\nand sold electric guitars, organs, and a range of other modern instruments, as well as\nstate-of-the-art audio and video equipment. He developed a relationship with Taro\nKakehashi, the founder of Japan’s Roland group, which led to a joint venture that brought\nelectronic musical devices to Australia.\nIn 1965, Brash and his wife attended a trade fair in Guangzhou, the first of its kind in China;\nthey were one of the first Western business people allowed into the country following Mao\nZedong’s Cultural Revolution. He returned there many times, helping advise the Chinese in\nestablishing a high quality piano factory in Beijing; he became the factory’s agent in\nAustralia. Brash also took leading jazz musicians Don Burrows and James Morrison to\nChina, on a trip that reintroduced jazz to many Chinese musicians.\nHe stood down as Executive Chairman of Brash’s in 1988, but under the new management\ndebt became a problem, and in 1994 the banks called in administrators. The company was\nsold to Singaporean interests and continued to trade until 1998, when it again went into\nadministration. The Brash name then disappeared from the retail world. Brash was greatly\n \n1\n\ndisappointed by the collapse and the eventual disappearance of the company he had run\nfor so long. But it was not long before he invested in a restructured Allan’s music business.\nBrash was a committed philanthropist who, in the mid-1980s, established the Brash\nFoundation, which eventually morphed, with other partners, into the Soundhouse Music\nAlliance. This was a not-for-profit organisation overseeing and promoting multimedia music\nmaking and education for teachers and students. The Soundhouse offers teachers and\nyoung people the opportunity to get exposure to the latest music technology, and to use\nthis to compose and record their own music, either alone or in collaboration. The\norganisation has now also established branches in New Zealand, South Africa and Ireland,\nas well as numerous sites around Australia.\n \n2",
