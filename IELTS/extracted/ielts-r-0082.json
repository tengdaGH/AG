  "passage_text": "Reading Practice\n \nCalifornia’s age of Megafires\nA\n There’s a reason fire squads now battling more than a dozen blazes in southern California\nare having such difficulty containing the flames, despite better preparedness than ever and\ndecades of experience fighting fires fanned by the notorious Santa Ana winds. The wildfires\nthemselves, experts say, generally are hotter, move faster, and spread more erratically\nthan in the past.\nB\nThe short-term explanation is that the region, which usually has dry summers, has had nine\ninches less rain than normal this year. Longer-term, climate change across the West is\nleading to hotter days on average and longer fire seasons. Experts say this is likely to yield\nmore megafires like the conflagrations that this week forced evacuations of at least\n300,000 resident in California’s southland and led President Bush to declare a disaster\nemergency in seven counties on Tuesday.\nC\nMegafires, also called “siege fires,” are the increasingly frequent blazes that burn 500,000\nacres or more – 10 times the size of the average forest fire of 20 years ago. One of the\ncurrent wildfires is the sixth biggest in California ever, in terms of acreage burned,\naccording to state figures and news reports. The trend to more superhot fires, experts say,\nhas been driven by a century-long policy of the US Forest Service to stop wildfires as\nquickly as possible. The unintentional consequence was to halt the natural eradication of\nunderbrush, now the primary fuel for megafires. Three other factors contribute to the trend,\nthey add. First is climate change marked by a 1-degree F. rise in average yearly\ntemperature across the West. Second is a fire season that on average is 78 days longer\nthan in the late 1980s. The third is the increased building of homes and other structures in\nwooded areas.\nD\n“We are increasingly building our homes … in fire-prone ecosystems,” says Dominik\nKulakowski, adjunct professor of biology at Clark University Graduate School of Geography\nin Worcester, Mass. Doing that “in many of the forests of the Western US … is like building\nhomes on the side of an active volcano.” In California, where population growth has\naveraged more than 600,000 a year for at least a decade, housing has pushed into such\nareas. “What once was open space is now residential homes providing fuel to make fires\nburn with greater intensity,” says Terry McHale of the California Department of Forestry\nfirefighters union. “With so much dryness, so many communities to catch fire, so many\nfronts to fight, it becomes an almost incredible job.”\nE\nThat said, many experts give California high marks for making progress on preparedness\nsince 2003, when the largest fires in state history scorched 750,000 acres, burned 3,640\nhomes, and killed 22 people. Stung then by criticism of bungling that allowed fires to\nspread when they might have been contained, personnel are meeting the peculiar\n \n1\n\nchallenges of a neighborhood – and canyon-hopping fires better than in recent years,\nobservers say.\nF\nState promises to provide newer engines, planes, and helicopters have been fulfilled.\nFirefighters unions that then complained of dilapidated equipment, old fire engines and\ninsufficient blueprints for fire safety are now praising the state’s commitment, noting that\nfunding for firefighting has increased despite huge cuts in many other programs. “We are\npleased that the Schwarzenegger administration has been very proactive in its support of\nus and come through with budgetary support of the infrastructure needs we have long\nsought,” says Mr McHale with the firefighters union.\nG\nBesides providing money to upgrade the fire engines that must traverse the mammoth\nstate and wind along serpentine canyon roads, the state has invested in better command-\nand-control facilities as well as the strategies to run them. “In the fire sieges of earlier\nyears, we found out that we had the willingness of mutual-aid help from other jurisdictions\nand states, but we were not able to communicate adequately with them,” says Kim Zagaris,\nchief of the state’s Office of Emergency Services, fire and rescue branch. After a 2004\nblue-ribbon commission examined and revamped those procedures, the statewide\nresponse “has become far more professional and responsive,” he says.\nH\nBesides ordering the California National Guard on Monday to make 1,500 guardsmen\navailable for firefighting efforts, Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger asked the Pentagon to send\nall available Modular Airborne Fighting Systems to the area. The military Lockheed C-130\ncargo/utility aircraft carry a pressurized 3,000-gallon tank that can eject fire retardant or\nwater in fewer than five seconds through two tubes at the rear of the plane. This load can\ncover an area 1/4-mile long and 60 feet wide to create a fire barrier. Governor\nSchwarzenegger also directed 2,300 inmate firefighters and 170 custody staff from the\nCalifornia Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation to work for hand in hand with state\nand local firefighters.\nI\nResidents and government officials alike are noting the improvements with gratitude, even\namid the loss of homes, churches, businesses, and farms. By Tuesday morning, the fires\nhad burned 1,200 homes and businesses and set 245,957 acres – 384 square miles –\nablaze. Despite such losses, there is a sense that the speed, dedication, and coordination\nof firefighters from several states and jurisdictions are resulting in greater efficiency than in\npast “siege fire” situations.\nJ\n“I am extraordinarily impressed by the improvements we have witnessed between the last\nbig fire and this,” says Ross Simmons, a San Diego-based lawyer who had to evacuate\nboth his home and business on Monday, taking up residence at a Hampton Inn 30 miles\nsouth of his home in Rancho Bernardo. After fires consumed 172,000 acres there in 2003,\nthe San Diego region turned communitywide soul-searching into improved building codes,\nevacuation procedures, and procurement of new technology. Mr Simmons and neighbors\n \n2\n\nbegan receiving automated phone calls at 3:30 a.m. Monday morning telling them to\nevacuate. “Notwithstanding all the damage that will be caused by this, we will not come\nclose to the loss of life because of what we have … put in place since then,” he says.\n \n3",
