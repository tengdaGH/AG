  "passage_text": "Reading Practice\n \nTalc Powder\nPeter Rrigg discovers how talc from Luzenac’s Trimouns in France find its way into\nfood and agricultural products—from chewing  gum to olive oil.\nHigh in the French Pyrenees, some 1,700m above see level, lies Trimouns, a huge deposit\nof hydrated magnesium silicate - talc to you and me. Talc from Trimouns, and from ten\nother Luzenac mines across the globe, is used in the manufacture of a vast array of\neveryday products extending from paper, paint and plaster to cosmetics, plastics and car\ntyres. And of course there is always talc’s best known end use: talcum powder for babies’\nbottoms. But the true versatility of this remarkable mineral is nowhere better displayed than\nin its sometimes surprising use in certain niche markets in the food and agriculture\nindustries.\nTake, for example, the chewing gum business. Every year, Talc de Luzenac\nFrance—which owns and operates the Trimouns mine and is a member of the international\nLuzenac Group (art of Rio Tinto minerals)—supplies about 6,000 tones of talc to chewing\ngum manufacturers in Europe. “We’ve been selling to this sector of the market since the\n1960s,”says Laurent Fournier, sales manager in Luzenac’s Specialties business unit in\nToulouse. “Admittedly, in terms of our total annual sales of talc, the amount we supply to\nchewing gum manufacturers is relatively small, but we see it as a valuable niche market:\none where customers place a premium on securing supplies from a reliable, high quality\nsource. Because of this, long term allegiance to a proven suppler is very much a feature of\nthis sector of the talc market.”Switching sources—in the way that you might choose to buy,\nsay, paperclips from Supplier A rather than from Supplier B—is not  a easy option for\nchewing gum manufacturers,”Fournier says. “The cost of reformulating is high, so when\ncustomers are using a talc grade that works, even if it’s expensive, they are understandably\nreluctant to switch.”\nBut how is talc actually used in the manufacture of chewing gum? PatrickDelord, an\nengineer with a degree in agronomics, who has been with Luzenac for 22 years and is now\nsenior market development manager, Agriculture and Food, in Europe, explains that\nchewing gums has four main components. “The most important of them is the gum\nbase,”he says. “It’s the gum base that puts the chew into chewing gum. It binds all the\ningredients together, creating a soft, smooth texture. To this the manufacturer then adds\nsweeteners, softeners and flavourings. Our talc is used as a filler in the gum base. The\namount varies between, say, ten and 35 per cent, depending on the type of gum. Fruit\nflavoured chewing gum, for example, is slightly acidic and would react with the calcium\ncarbonate that the manufacturer might otherwise use as a filler. Talc, on the other hand,\nmakes an ideal filler because it’s non-reactive chemically. In the factory, talc is also used to\ndust the gum base pellets and to stop the chewing gum sticking during the lamination and\npacking process,”Delord adds.\nThe chewing gum business is, however, just one example of talc’s use in the food sector.\nFor the past 20 years or so, olive oil processors in Spain have been taking advantage of\ntalc’s unique characteristics to help them boost the amount of oil they extract from crushed\n \n1\n\nolives. According to Patrick Delord, talc is especially useful for treating what he calls\n“difficult” olives. After the olives are harvested-preferably early in the morning because their\ntaste is better if they are gathered in the cool of the day - they are taken to the processing\nplant. There they are crushed and then stirred for 30-45 minutes. In the old days, the\nresulting paste was passed through an olive press but nowadays it’s more common to add\nwater and centrifuge  the mixture to separate the water and oil from the solid matter. The oil\nand water are then allowed to settle so that the olive oil layer can be decanted oft and\nbottled. “Difficult” olives are those that are more reluctant than the norm to yield up their full\noil content. This may be attributable to the particular species of olive, or to its water content\nand the time of year the olives are collected—at the beginning and the end of the season\ntheir water content is often either too high or too low. These olives are easy to recognize\nbecause they produce a lot of extra  foam during the stirring process, a consequence of an\nexcess of a fine solid that acts as anatural emulsifier. The oil in this emulsion is lost when\nthe water is disposed of. Not only that, if the waste water is disposed of directly into local\nfields—often the case in many smaller processing operations—the emulsified oil may take\nsome time to biodegrade and so be harmful to the environment.\n“If you add between a it absorbs the half and two percent of talc by weightduring the stirring\nprocess, it absorbs the natural emulsifier in the olives and so boosts the amount of oil you\ncan extract,”says Delord. “In addition, talc’s flat, platey’ structure helps increase the size of\nthe oil droplets liberated during stirring, which again improves the yield. However, because\ntalc is chemically inert, it doesn’t affect the colour, taste, appearance or composition of the\nresulting olive oil.”\nIf the use of talc in olive oil processing and in chewing gum is long established, new\napplications in the food and agriculture industries are also constantly being sought by\nLuzenac. One such promising new market is fruit crop protection, being pioneered in the\nUS. Just like people, fruit can get sunburned. In fact, in very sunny regions up to 45 percent\nof atypical crop can be affected by heat stress and sunburn. However, in the case of fruit,\nit’s not so much the ultra violet rays which harm the crop as the high surface temperature\nthat the sun’s rays create.\nTo combat this, farmers normally use either chemicals or spray a continuous fine canopy of\nmist above the fruit trees or bushes. The trouble is, this uses a lot of water—normally a\nprecious commodity in hot, sunny areas—and it is therefore expensive. What’s more, the\nground can quickly become waterlogged.” So our idea was to coat the fruit with talc to\nprotect it from the sun,”says Greg Hunter, a marketing specialist who has been with\nLuzenac for ten years. “But to do this, several technical challenges had first to be\novercome. Talc is very hydrophobic: it doesn’t like water. So in order to have a viable\nproduct we needed a wettable powder—something that would go readily into suspension\nso that it could be sprayed onto the fruit. It also had to break the surface tension of the\ncutin (the natural waxy, waterproof layer on the fruit) and of course it had to wash off easily\nwhen the fruit was harvested. No-one’s going to want an apple that’s covered in talc.”\nInitial trials in the state of Washington in 2003 showed that when the product was sprayed\nonto Granny Smith apples, it reduced their surface temperature and lowered the incidence\nof sunburn by up to 60 per cent. Today the new product, known as Invelop Maximum SPF,\nis in its second commercial year on the US market. Apple growers are the primary target\nalthough Hunter believes grape growers represent another sector with long term potential.\n \n2\n\nHe is also hopeful of extending sales to overseas markets such as Australia, South \nAmerica and southern Europe.\n \n3",
