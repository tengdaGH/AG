  "passage_text": "Reading Practice\n \nSnow-makers\n \nSkiing is big business nowadays. But what can ski resort owners do if the snow\ndoesn't come?\n \nA In the early to mid twentieth century, with the growing popularity of skiing, ski slopes\nbecame extremely profitable businesses. But ski resort owners were completely dependent\non the weather: if it didn't snow, or didn’t snow enough, they had to close everything down.\nFortunately, a device called the snow gun can now provide snow whenever it is needed.\nThese days such machines are standard equipment in the vast majority of ski resorts\naround the world, making it possible for many resorts to stay open for months or more a\nyear.\n \nB Snow formed by natural weather systems comes from water vapour in the atmosphere.\nThe water vapour condenses into droplets, forming clouds. If the temperature is sufficiently\nlow, the water droplets freeze into tiny ice crystals. More water particles then condense\nonto the crystal and join with it to form a snowflake. As the snow flake grows heavier, it falls\ntowards the Earth.\n \nC The snow gun works very differently from a natural weather system, but it accomplishes\nexactly the same thing. The device basically works by combining water and air. Two\ndifferent hoses are attached to the gun. one leading from a water pumping station which\npumps water up from a lake or reservoir, and the other leading from an air compressor.\nWhen the compressed air passes through the hose into the gun. it atomises the water - that\nis, it disrupts the stream so that the water splits up into tiny droplets. The droplets are then\nblown out of the gun and if the outside temperature is below 0°C, ice crystals will form, and\nwill then make snowflakes in the same way as natural snow.\n \nD Snow-makers often talk about dry snow and wet snow. Dry snow has a relatively low\namount of water, so it is very light and powdery. This type of snow is excellent for skiing\nbecause skis glide over it easily without getting stuck in wet slush. One of the advantages\nof using a snow-maker is that this powdery snow can be produced to give the ski slopes a\nlevel surface. However, on slopes which receive heavy use, resort owners also use denser,\nwet snow underneath the dry snow. Many resorts build up the snow depth this way once or\ntwice a year, and then regularly coat the trails with a layer of dry snow throughout the\nwinter.\n \nE The wetness of snow is dependent on the temperature and humidity outside, as well as\nthe size of the water droplets launched by the gun. Snow-makers have to adjust the\nproportions of water and air in their snow guns to get the perfect snow consistency for the\noutdoor weather conditions. Many ski slopes now do this with a central computer system\nthat is connected to weather-reading stations all over the slope.\nF But man-made snow makes heavy demands on the environment. It takes about 275,000\nlitres of water to create a blanket of snow covering a 60x60 metre area. Most resorts pump\nwater from one or more reservoirs located in low-lying areas. The run-off water from the\nslopes feeds back into these reservoirs, so the resort can actually use the same water over\nand over again. However, considerable amounts of energy are needed to run the large air-\ncompressing pumps, and the diesel engines which run them also cause air pollution.\n \n1\n\n \nG Because of the expense of making snow, ski resorts have to balance the cost of running\nthe machines with the benefits of extending the ski season, making sure they only make\nsnow when it is really needed and when it will bring the maximum amount of profit in return\nfor the investment. But man-made snow has a number of other uses as well. A layer of\nsnow keeps a lot of the Earth’s heat from escaping into the atmosphere, so farmers often\nuse man-made snow to provide insulation for winter crops. Snow-making machines have\nplayed a big part in many movie productions. Movie producers often take several months to\nshoot scenes that cover just a few days. If the movie takes place in a snowy setting, the set\ndecorators have to get the right amount of snow for each day of shooting either by adding\nman-made snow or melting natural snow. And another important application of man-made\nsnow is its use in the tests that aircraft must undergo in order to ensure that they can\nfunction safely in extreme conditions.\n \n2",
