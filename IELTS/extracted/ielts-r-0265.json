  "passage_text": "Reading Practice\n \nLost for words\nIn the Native American Navajo nation, which sprawls across four states in the American\nsouth-west, the native language is dying. Most of its speakers are middle-aged or elderly\nAlthough many students take classes in Navajo, the schools are run in English. Street\nsigns, supermarket goods and even their own newspaper are all in English. Not\nsurprisingly, linguists doubt that any native speakers of Navajo will remain in a hundred\nyears’ time.\nNavajo is far from alone. Half the world’s 6,800 languages are likely to vanish within two\ngenerations - that’s one language lost every ten days. Never before has the planet’s\nlinguistic diversity shrunk at such a pace. At the moment, we are heading for about three or\nfour languages dominating the world,’ says Mark Pagel, an evolutionary biologist at the\nUniversity of Reading. ‘It’s a mass extinction, and whether we will ever rebound from the\nloss is difficult to know.’\nIsolation breeds linguistic diversity: as a result, the world is peppered with languages\nspoken by only a few people. Only 250 languages have more than a million speakers, and\nat least 3,000 have fewer than 2,500. It is not necessarily these small languages that are\nabout to disappear. Navajo is considered endangered despite having 150,000 speakers.\nWhat makes a language endangered is not just the number of speakers, but how old they\nare. If it is spoken by children it is relatively safe. The critically endangered languages are\nthose that are only spoken by the elderly, according to Michael Krauss, director of the\nAlassk Native Language Center, in Fairbanks.\nWhy do people reject the language of their parents? It begins with a crisis of confidence,\nwhen a small community finds itself alongside a larger, wealthier society, says Nicholas\nOstler, of Britain’s Foundation for Endangered Languages, in Bath. ‘People lose faith in\ntheir culture,’ he says. ‘When the next generation reaches their teens, they might not want\nto be induced into the old traditions.’\nThe change is not always voluntary. Quite often, governments try to kill off a minority\nlanguage by banning its use in public or discouraging its use in schools, all to promote\nnational unity. \nThe former US policy of running Indian reservation schools in English, for example,\neffectively put languages such as Navajo on the danger list. But Salikoko Mufwene, who\nchairs the Linguistics department at the University of Chicago, argues that the deadliest\nweapon is not government policy but economic globalisation. ‘Native Americans have not\nlost pride in their language, but they have had to adapt to socio-economic pressures,’ he\nsays. ‘They cannot refuse to speak English if most commercial activity is in English.’ But\nare languages worth saving? At the very least, there is a loss of data for the study of\nlanguages and their evolution, which relies on comparisons between languages, both living\nand dead. When an unwritten and unrecorded language disappears, it is lost to science.\nLanguage is also intimately bound up with culture, so it may be difficult to preserve one\nwithout the other. ‘If a person shifts from Navajo to English, they lose something,’ Mufwene\nsays. ‘Moreover, the loss of diversity may also deprive us of different ways of looking at the\nworld,’ says Pagel. There is mounting evidence that learning a language produces\nphysiological changes in the brain. ‘Your brain and mine are different from the brain of\n \n1\n\nsomeone who speaks French, for instance,’ Pagel says, and this could affect our thoughts\nand perceptions. ‘The patterns and connections we make among various concepts may be\nstructured by the linguistic habits of our community.’\nSo despite linguists’ best efforts, many languages will disappear over the next century. But\na growing interest in cultural identity may prevent the direst predictions from coming true.\n‘The key to fostering diversity is for people to learn their ancestral tongue, as well as the\ndominant language,’ says Doug Whalen, founder and president of the Endangered\nLanguage Fund in New Haven, Connecticut. ‘Most of these languages will not survive\nwithout a large degree of bilingualism,’ he says. In New Zealand, classes for children have\nslowed the erosion of Maori and rekindled interest in the language. A similar approach in\nHawaii has produced about 8,000 new speakers of Polynesian languages in the past few\nyears. In California, ‘apprentice’ programmes have provided life support to several\nindigenous languages. Volunteer ‘apprentices’ pair up with one of the last living speakers of\na Native American tongue to learn a traditional skill such as basket weaving, with\ninstruction exclusively in the endangered language. After about 300 hours of training they\nare generally sufficiently fluent to transmit the language to the next generation. But\nMufwene says that preventing a language dying out is not the same as giving it new life by\nusing it every day. ‘Preserving a language is more like preserving fruits in a jar,’ he says.\nHowever, preservation can bring a language back from the dead. There are examples of\nlanguages that have survived in written form and then been revived by later generations.\nBut a written form is essential for this, so the mere possibility of revival has led many\nspeakers of endangered languages to develop systems of writing where none existed\nbefore.\n \n2",
