  "passage_text": "Reading Practice\n \nHow tsunamis are made\nThe word tsunami comes from the Japanese. It means “harbor\" (tsu) and “wave” (nami).\nThe first person to discover a tsunami was a fisherman. He returned to shore on his boat.\nWhen he reached the beach, he saw the harbor was gone. This caught him by surprise.\nThe fisherman did not expect this to happen. He did not feel a strong wave out in the\nocean. He realized that it was not wind that created waves in the ocean. It was something\nstronger and deeper.\nTsunamis form after an earthquake. Earthquakes happen in special zones. These are\ncalled Subduction zones. They lie deep on the ocean floor. Famous Subduction zones arc\nin the Indian Ocean and the South East Pacific Ocean. Here the ocean floor is divided into\ntwo plates. These two pieces of floor slide one over the other very gently. But sometimes\nthey collide. They crash into each other. The shock causes an earthquake. The earth\nshakes and lifts the ocean water above. Huge waves are generated. The waves made by\nthe earthquake form a tsunami.\nA tsunami carries a lot of energy. It has created deep in the ocean. Thus its waves have far\nmore power than normal waves. They carry a lot of speed. They travel faster and faster\nand get bigger and bigger. These waves travel across the ocean with 500 to 1,000 km/h. A\nset of waves is called a train. There is usually a big distance between these waves.\nSometimes it can take an hour for a new tsunami wave to pass. But these waves are\nextremely long. A tsunami wave can have a length of several hundred kilometers. In the\nopen ocean, a tsunami wave is only a few meters high. People on the open ocean do not\nfeel it.\nBut things change when tsunami waves get close to shore. The sea becomes shallower.\nThe water is not so deep anymore. The tsunami waves have no room to carry their energy\nand cannot travel as quickly. So they begin to pile up. They start to get on top of each\nother.  There is no more distance between the waves. The waves get steeper and taller\nuntil they reach huge heights. A typical tsunami wave on shore is 30 m high. All the energy\nis now inside this huge wave. When it crashes on land, it carries great power and destroys\neverything in its path.\nThe biggest tsunami in the history of the world happened on December 26, 2004. It hit\nSouth East Asia. 230,000 people were killed, 168,000 in Indonesia alone. There were\nmillions of dollars worth in damage. Scientists have analyzed this tsunami. They are trying\nto figure out new methods to track down tsunamis. One way to discover a tsunami is to use\na tsunameter. This device is put deep into the ocean near Subduction zones. It senses\nwhen an earthquake happens. Then it sends signals to a nearby computer. The computer\ngenerates a tsunami model. Scientists read the computer model and can send early\nwarnings to people in danger. \n \n1",
