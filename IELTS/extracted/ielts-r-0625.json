  "passage_text": "Reading Practice\n \nWhat is the secret of a long life?\nThis year, the number of retired pensioners in the UK exceeded the number of under 18\nyears old for the first time in history. That's remarkable in its own right, but the real\n'population explosion' has been among the oldest of the old — the centenarians. In fact,\nthis imbalance is the fastest growing demographic in much of the developed world. In the\nUK, the number of centenarians has increased by 60 per cent since the early 20th century.\nAnd their ranks are set swell even further, thanks to the ageing baby-boomer generation:\nby 2030 there will be about a million worldwide.\nThese trends raise social, ethical and economic dilemmas. Are medical advances artificially\nprolonging life, with hide regard for the quality of that life? If growing numbers of elderly\npeople become dependent on state or familial support, society faces skyrocketing costs\nand commitments. Yet researchers who study the oldest old have made a surprising\ndiscovery that presents a less pessimistic view of the future than many anticipate.\n \nIt is becoming clear that people who break through the 90-plus barrier represent a physical\nelite. Far from gaining a longer burden of disability, their extra years tend to be healthy\nones. And supercentenarians, people aged 110 or over, are even better examples of\nageing well. The average supercentenarian had freely gone about their daily life up until the\nage of 105 or so, some five to ten years longer even than centenarians.\n \n \n \nOne of the most comprehensive studies comes from Denmark. In 1998 Kare Christensen,\nat the University of Southern Denmark, contacted every single one of 3600 people born in\n1905 who was still alive. Assessing their health over the subsequent decade, he found that\nthe proportion of people who managed to remain independent throughout was constantly\naround one-third of the total. Each individual risked becoming more infirm, but the\nunhealthiest ones passed away at earlier ages, leaving the strongest behind. In 2005, only\n166 of the people in Christensen's sample were still alive, but one-third of those were still\nentirely self-sufficient.\n \n \nChristensen's optimistic findings are echoed in studies all over the world. In the MC, Carol\nBrayne at the University of Cambridge studied 958 people aged over 90, and found that\nonly one-quarter of them were living in accommodation specifically catering for the needs\nof older people. Research in China reveals that centenarians and nonagenarians spend\nfewer days ill and in bed than younger elderly groups. Of course, people can live\nindependently without being entirely healthy, and it is true that most centenarians suffer\nfrom some kind of ailment. These range from osteoarthritis to simple loneliness.\nNot all the oldest old survive by delaying illness or disability, though. Many soldier through\nit. Jessica Even of Ohio State University examined the medical histories of over 400\ncentenarians. She found that those who achieve extreme longevity tend to fall into three\ncategories. About 40 per cent were 'delayers', who avoided chronic diseases until after the\nage of 80. Another 40 per cent were 'survivors', who suffered from chronic diseases before\nthe age of 80 but lived longer to tell the tale. The final 20 per cent were 'escapers', who\nreached their century with no sign of the most common chronic diseases. Intriguingly, one-\nthird of male centenarians were in this category, compared with only 15 per cent of women.\nIn fact, the two sexes fare very differently when it comes to longevity. There are far more\nfemale centenarians, but the reasons for this are unclear. Certainly, women tend to lead\nhealthier lifestyles and experience fewer serious accidents. They also go to their doctor\n \n1\n\n \n \nmore. Men are more prone to risky behaviour and chronic illness, so it must be genetics\nwhich allows some men to reach extreme old age. Evidence of this comes from longevity\nhotspots.\nThe Japanese island of Okinawa is the front runner. At 58 centenarians per 100,000\npeople, it has the world's highest proportion in this age group, with Sardinia and Iceland not\ntoo far behind. All three are relatively isolated island communities, which leads to less\ngenetic variation amongst inhabitants. In these places, the result has been a predisposition\ntowards a longer life.
