  "passage_text": "Reading Practice\n \nChildren's comprehension\nA In 1874, long before the advent of television, the English Parliament passed a law to\nprotect children ‘from their own lack of experience and from the wiles of pushing tradesmen\nand moneylenders’ (James, 1965). The act is one of the earliest governmental policies to\naddress children’s vulnerability to commercial exploitation and was produced before major\ncorporations earned huge profits by marketing products directly to children. Yet the issues\nunderlying this 19th-century policy remain much the same in the 21st century.\nB Television has long been the predominant medium that advertisers have chosen for\nmarketing products to children. It is estimated that the average child sees more than\n40.000 television commercials a year, most of which are 15 to 30 seconds in length\n(Kunkel, 2001). According to another estimate, children aged 14 years and under make\n$24 billion in direct, purchases and influence $190 billion in family purchases, underscoring\nthe high stakes involved (McNeal, 1987).\nC A number of factors have contributed to an unprecedented growth in both the amount\nand type of advertising directed at children. First and foremost among these are changes in\nthe media environment. In decades past, television programming targeted at children was\nlimited and relegated to time slots unpopular with their parents, such as Saturday\nmornings of television advertising\n(Turow, 1981). Today, the number of channels received in the average US home has\nescalated with the diffusion of cable television and satellite technologies. In this new multi-\nchannel era, there are numerous national program services devoted exclusively to children.\nNaturally, these channels deliver significant amounts of child- oriented marketing\nmessages. Although parent may be pleased that their youngsters can now watch children’s\nprogramming at any hour of the day, they may not recognize that such viewing\nopportunities entail much greater exposure to advertising than any previous generation of\nyouth has experienced.\nD Approximately 80% of all advertising targeted at children falls within four product\ncategories: toys, cereals, candies, and fast-food restaurants (Kunkel et al, 1992).\nCommercials are highly effective at employing specific features designed to attract\nchildren’s attention. For example, they use the strategy of introducing unique sound effects\nand rapidly moving images (Greer et al, 1982). The other most common persuasive\nstrategy employed in advertising to children is to associate the product with playfulness and\nhappiness, rather than to provide any actual product-related information (Kunkel et al,\n1992). For example, a commercial featuring Ronald McDonald dancing, singing, and\nsmiling in McDonald’s restaurants without any mention of the actual food products available\nreflects a playful or happy theme. This strategy is also found frequently with cereal ads,\nwhich often include cartoon characters to help children identify the product. In contrast,\nmost commercials fail to mention even the major grain used in each cereal.\nE Another common feature of advertising to children is the use of product disclosures such\nas 'batteries not included’ or 'each part sold separately'. Studies make clear that young\nchildren do not comprehend the intended meaning of these disclaimers. For example,\nfewer than one in four kindergarten through second grade children could grasp the\nmeaning of 'some assembly required' in a commercial. In contrast, the use of child-friendly\nlanguage such as 'you have to put it together' more than doubled the proportion of children\n \n1\n\nwho understood the qualifying message (Liebert et al, 1977). The phrase 'part of a\nbalanced breakfast’ is also a frequent disclosure included in most cereal ads to combat the\nconcern that sugared cereal holds little nutritional value for children. Research shows that\nmost children below age 7 years have no idea what the term ‘balanced breakfast’ means\n(Palmer & McDowell, 1981). Rather than informing young viewers about the importance of\na nutritious breakfast, this common disclaimer actually leaves many children with the\nmisimpression that cereal alone is sufficient for a meal. This pattern of employing creative\nterminology in advertising content so as to obscure certain information that might be\nunhelpful to the sponsor is a long-standing practice that often misleads the consumer\n(Geis, 1982).\nF Very young children do not recognize that there are two fundamentally different\ncategories of television content: programs and commercials. Most children below the age\nof 4 or 6 exhibit low awareness of the concept of commercials, frequently explaining them\nas if they were a scene in the program itself. Once this confusion diminishes, children first\nrecognize the difference between programs and commercials based on either affective\n(‘commercials are funnier than TV programs') or perceptual (‘commercials are short and\nprograms are long’) cues (Blatt et al, 1972).\nG Although most children's programs indicate that a commercial break is coming (e.g. by\nsaying 'We’ll be right back after these messages’), research reveals that these ‘separators'\ngenerally do not help children to recognize advertising content (Palmer & McDowell, 1979).\nThis likely occurs because they are not perceptually distinct from the adjacent\nprogramming that surrounds them; in fact, many separators feature characters that appear\nin the same show that the commercial has just interrupted. When an ad includes one of the\ncharacters featured in a program, this is known as host-selling. This type of advertising\nmakes the task of discriminating between program and commercial content particularly\ndifficult for young children (Kunkel, 1988) and is thus restricted in the US by the Federal\nCommunications Commission during children’s programs.\nH In sum, because young children lack the cognitive skills and abilities of older children and\nadults, they do not comprehend commercial messages in the same way as more mature\naudiences, and are therefore uniquely susceptible to advertising influence.\n \n2",
