But, contrary to expectation, paper consumption throughout the world shows no sign\nof abating. In fact, consumption, especially of printing and writing papers, continues to\nincrease. World demand for paper and board is now expected to grow faster than the\ngeneral economic growth in the next 15 years. Strong demand will be underprinted by the\ngrowing industrialization of South East Asia, the reemergence of paper packaging, greater\nuse of facsimile machines and photocopiers, and the popularity of direct -mail advertising. It\nis possible that by 2007, world paper and board demand will reach 455 million tonnes,\ncompared with 241 million tonnes in 1991.\n \n2.    The pulp and paper industry has not been badly affected by the electronic technologies\nthat promised a paperless society. But what has radically altered the industry’s structure is\npressure from another front-a more environmentally conscious society driving an\nirreversible move towards cleaner industrial production. The environmental consequences\nof antiquated pulp mill practices and technologies had marked this industry as one in need\nof reform. Graphic descriptions of deformed fish and thinning populations, particularly in the\nBaltic Sea where old pulp mills had discharged untreated effluents for 100 years, have\ndisturbed the international community.\n \n3.    Until the 1950s, it was common for pulp mills and other industries to discharge\nuntreated effluent into rivers and seas. The environmental effects were at the time either\nnot understood, or regarded as an acceptable cost of economic prosperity in an\nincreasingly import-oriented world economy. But greater environmental awareness has\nspurred a fundamental change in attitude in the community, in government and in industry\nitself.\n \n4.    Since the early 1980s, most of the world-scale pulp mills in Scandinavia and North\nAmerica have modernized their operations, outlying substantial amounts to improve\nproduction methods. Changes in mill design and processes have been aimed at minimizing\nthe environmental effects of effluent discharge while at the same time producing pulp with\nthe whiteness and strength demanded by the international market. The environmental\nimpetus is taking this industry even further, with the focus now on developing processes\nthat may even eliminate waste-water discharges. But the ghost of the old mills continues to\nhaunt industry today. In Europe, companies face a flood of environment-related legislation.\nIn Germany, companies are now being held responsible for the waste they create.\n \n5.    Pulp is the porridge -like mass of plant fibers from which paper is made. Paper makers\nchoose the type of plant fibre and the processing methods, depending on what the end\nproduct will be used for: whether it is a sturdy packing box, a smooth sheet of writing paper\nor a fragile tissue. In wood, which is the source of about 90% of the world’s paper\nproduction, fibres are bound together by lignin, which gives the unbleached pulp a brown\ncolour. Pulping can be done by mechanical grinding, or by chemical treatment in which\nwoodchips are “cooked” with chemicals, or by a combination of both methods.\n6.    Kraft pulping is the most widely used chemical process for producing pulp with the\nstrength required by the high-quality paper market. It is now usually carried out in a\ncontinuous process in a large vessel called digester. Woodchips are fed from a pile into the\ntop of the digester. In the digester, the chips are cooked in a solution called white liquor,\n \n1\n\nnosed of caustic soda (sodium hydroxide) sodium sulphide. The chips are cooked at high\ntemperatures of up to 170 degree for up to three hours. The pulp is then washed and rate\nfrom the spent cooking liquor which has turned dark and is now appropriately ailed black\nliquor. An important feature of kraft pulping is a chemical recovery system which recycles\nabout 95 % of the cooking chemicals and produces more than enough energy runs the mill.\nIn a series of steps involving a furnace and tanks, some of the black liquor is transformed\ninto energy, while some is regenerated into the original white cooking liquor. The pulp that\ncomes out has little lignin left in the fibres. Bleaching removes the last remaining lignin and\nbrightens the pulp. Most modern mills have modified their pulping process to remove as\nmuch of the lignin as possible before the pulp moves to the bleaching stage. \n \n2",
