  "passage_text": "Reading Practice\n \nNatural pesticide in India\nA\nA dramatic story about cotton farmers in India shows how destructive pesticides can be for\npeople and the environment; and why today’s agriculture is so dependent on pesticides.\nThis story also shows that it’s possible to stop using chemical pesticides without losing a\ncrop to ravaging insects, and it explains how to do it.\nB\nThe story began about 30 years ago, a handful of families migrated from the Guntur district\nof Andhra Pradesh, southeast India, into Punukula, a community of around 900 people\nfarming plots of between two and 10 acres. The outsiders from Guntur brought cotton-\nculture with them. Cotton wooed farmers by promising to bring in more hard cash than the\nmixed crops they were already growing to eat and sell: millet, sorghum, groundnuts, pigeon\npeas, mung beans, chili and rice. But raising cotton meant using pesticides and fertilizers –\nuntil then a mystery to the mostly illiterate farmers of the community. When cotton\nproduction started spreading through Andhra Pradesh state. The high value of cotton made\nit an exceptionally attractive crop, but growing cotton required chemical fertilizers and\npesticides. As most of the farmers were poor, illiterate, and without previous experience\nusing agricultural chemicals, they were forced to rely on local, small-scale agricultural\ndealers for advice. The dealers sold them seeds, fertilizers, and pesticides on credit and\nalso guaranteed the purchase of their crop. The dealers themselves had little technical\nknowledge about pesticides. They merely passed on promotional information from\nmultinational chemical companies that supplied their products.\nC\nAt first, cotton yields were high, and expenses for pesticides were low because cotton\npests had not yet moved in. The farmers had never earned so much! But within a few\nyears, cotton pests like bollworms and aphids plagued the fields, and the farmers saw how\nrapid insect evolution can be. Repeated spraying killed off the weaker pests, but left the\nones most resistant to pesticides to multiply. As pesticide resistance mounted, the farmers\nhad to apply more and more of the pesticides to get the same results. At the same time, the\npesticides killed off birds, wasps, beetles, spiders, and other predators that had once\nprovided natural control of pest insects. Without these predators, the pests could destroy\nthe entire crop if pesticides were not used. Eventually, farmers were mixing sometimes\nhaving to spray their cotton as frequently as two times a week. They were really hooked!\nD\nThe villagers were hesitant, but one of Punukula’s village elders decided to risk trying the\nnatural methods instead of pesticides. His son had collapsed with acute pesticide poisoning\nand survived but the hospital bill was staggering. SECURE’s staff coached this villager on\nhow to protect his cotton crop by using a toolkit of natural methods chat India’s Center for\nSustainable Agriculture put together in collaboration with scientists at Andhra Pradesh’s\nstate university. They called the toolkit “Non-Pesticide Management” – or “NPM.”\nE\n \n1\n\nThe most important resource in the NPM toolkit was the neem tree (Azadirachta indica)\nwhich is common throughout much of India. Neem tree is a broad-leaved evergreen tree\nrelated to mahogany. It protects itself against insects by producing a multitude of natural\npesticides that work in a variety of ways: with an arsenal of chemical defenses that repel\negg-laying, interfere with insect growth, and most important, disrupt the ability of crop-\neating insects to sense their food.\nF\nIn fact, neem has been used traditionally in India to protect stored grains from insects and\nto produce soaps, skin lotions, and other health products. To protect crops from insects,\nneem seeds are simply ground into a powder that is soaked overnight in water. The\nsolution is then sprayed onto the crop. Another preparation, neem cake, can be mixed into\nthe soil to kill pests and diseases in the soil, and it doubles as an organic fertilizer high in\nnitrogen. Neem trees grow locally, so the only “cost” is the labor to prepare neem for\napplication to fields.\nG\nThe first farmer’s trial with NPM was a complete success! His harvest was as good as the\nharvests of farmers that were using pesticides, and he earned much more because he did\nnot spend a single rupee on pesticides. Inspired by this success, 20 farmers tried NPM the\nnext year. SECURE posted two well-trained staff in Punukula to teach and help everyone in\nthe village, and the village women put pressure on their husbands to stop using toxic\nchemicals. Families that were no longer exposing themselves to pesticides began to feel\nmuch better, and the rapid improvement in income, health, and general wellbeing quickly\nsold everyone on the value of NPM. By 2000, all the farmers in Punukula were using NPM,\nnot only for cotton but for their other crops as well.\nH\nThe suicide epidemic came to an end. And with the cash, health, and energy that returned\nwhen they stopped poisoning themselves with pesticides, the villagers were inspired to\nstart more community and business projects. The women of Punukula created a new\nsource of income by collecting, grinding, and selling neem seeds for NPM in other villages.\nThe villagers rescued their indentured children and gave them special six-month “catch-\nup,” courses to return to school.\nI\nFighting against pesticides, and winning, increased village solidarity, self-confidence, and\noptimism about the future. When dealers tried to punish NPM users by paying less for NPM\ncotton, the farmers united to form a marketing cooperative that found fairer prices\nelsewhere. The leadership and collaboration skills that the citizens of Punukula developed\nin the NPM struggle have helped them to take on other challenges, like water purification,\nbuilding a cotton gin to add value to the cotton before they sell it, and convincing the state\ngovernment to support NPM over the objection of multi-national pesticide corporations.\n \n2",
