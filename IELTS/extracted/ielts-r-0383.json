  "passage_text": "Reading Practice\n \nSave Endangered Language\n“Obviously we must do some serious rethinking of our priorities, lest linguistics go down in\nhistory as the only science that presided obviously over the disappearance of 90 percent of\nthe very field to which it is dedicated.” – Michael Krauss, “The World’s Languages in\nCrisis”.\nA\nTen years ago Michael Krauss sent a shudder through the discipline of linguistics with his\nprediction that half the 6,000 or so languages spoken in the world would cease to be\nuttered within a century. Unless scientists and community leaders directed a worldwide\neffort to stabilize the decline of local languages, he warned, nine-tenths of the linguistic\ndiversity of humankind would probably be doomed to extinction. Krauss’s prediction was\nlittle more than an educated guess, but other respected linguists had been clanging out\nsimilar alarms. Keneth L. Hale of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology noted in the\nsame journal issue that eight languages on which he had done fieldwork had since passed\ninto extinction. A 1990 survey in Australia found that 70 of the 90 surviving Aboriginal\nlanguages were no longer used regularly by all age groups. The same was true for all but\n20 of the 175 Native American languages spoken or remembered in the US., Krauss told a\ncongressional panel in 1992.\nB\nMany experts in the field mourn the loss of rare languages, for several reasons. To start,\nthere is scientific self-interest: some of the most basic questions in linguistics have to do\nwith the limits of human speech, which are far from fully explored. Many researchers would\nlike to know which structural elements of grammar and vocabulary – if any – are truly\nuniversal and probably, therefore, hardwired into the human brain. Other scientists try to\nreconstruct ancient migration patterns by comparing borrowed words that appear in\notherwise unrelated languages. In each of these cases, the wider the portfolio of languages\nyou study, the more likely you are to get the right answers.\nC\nDespite the near-constant buzz in linguistics about endangered languages over the past 10\nyears, the field has accomplished depressingly little. “You would think that there would be\nsome organized response to this dire situation,” some attempt to determine which language\ncan be saved and which should be documented before they disappear, says Sarah G.\nThomason, a linguist at the University of Michigan at Ann Arbor. “But there isn’t any such\neffort organized in the profession. It is only recently that it has become fashionable enough\nto work on endangered languages.” Six years ago, recalls Douglas H. Whalen of Yale\nUniversity, “when I asked linguists who were raising money to deal with these problems, I\nmostly got blank stares.” So Whalen and a few other linguists founded the Endangered\nLanguages Fund. In the five years to 2001, they were able to collect only $80,000 for\nresearch grants. A similar foundation in England, directed by Nicholas Ostler, has raised\njust $8,000 since 1995.\nD\nBut there are encouraging signs that the field has turned a corner. The Volkswagen\n \n1\n\nFoundation, a German charity, just issued its second round of grants totaling more than $2\nmillion. It has created a multimedia archive at the Max Planck Institute for Psycholinguistics\nin the Netherlands that can house recordings, grammars, dictionaries and other data on\nendangered languages. To fill the archive, the foundation has dispatched field linguists to\ndocument Aweti (100 or so speakers in Brazil), Ega (about 300 speakers in Ivory Coast),\nWaima’a (a few hundred speakers in East Timor), and a dozen or so other languages\nunlikely to survive the century. The Ford Foundation has also edged into the arena. Its\ncontributions helped to reinvigorate a master-apprentice program created in 1992 by\nLeanne Hinton of Berkeley and Native Americans worried about the imminent demise of\nabout 50 indigenous languages in California. Fluent speakers receive $3,000 to teach a\nyounger relative (who is also paid) their native tongue through 360 hours of shared\nactivities, spread over six months. So far about 5 teams have completed the program,\nHinton says, transmitting a least some knowledge of 25 languages. “It’s too early to call this\nlanguage revitalization,” Hinton admits. “In California, the death rate of elderly speakers will\nalways be greater than the recruitment rate of young speakers. But at least we prolong the\nsurvival of the language.” That will give linguists more time to record these tongues before\nthey vanish.\nE\nBut the master-apprentice approach hasn’t caught on outside the U.S., and Hinton’s effort\nis a drop in the sea. At least 440 languages have been reduced to a mere handful of\nelders, according to the Ethnologue, a catalogue of languages produced by the Dallas-\nbased group SIL International that comes closest to global coverage. For the vast majority\nof these languages, there is little or no record of their grammar, vocabulary, pronunciation\nor use in daily life. Even if a language has been fully documented, all that remains once it\nvanishes from active use is a fossil skeleton, a scattering of features that the scientist was\nlucky and astute enough to capture. Linguists may be able to sketch an outline of the\nforgotten language and fix its place on the evolutionary tree, but little more. “How did\npeople start conversations and talk to babies? How dis husbands and wives converse?”\nHinton asks. “Those are the first  things you want to learn when you want to revitalize the\nlanguage.” \nF\nBut there is as yet no discipline of “conservation linguistics,” as there is for biology. Almost\nevery strategy tried so far has succeeded in some places but failed in others, and there\nseems to be no way to predict with certainty what will work where. Twenty years ago in\nNew Zealand, Maori speakers set up “language nests,” in which preschoolers were\nimmersed in the native language. Additional Maori-only classes were added as the children\nprogressed through elementary and secondary school. A similar approach was tried in\nHawaii, with some success – the number of native speakers has stabilized at 1,000 or so,\nreports Joseph E. Grimes of SIL International, who is working on Oahu. Students can now\nget instruction in Hawaiian all the way through university.\nG\nOne factor that always seems to occur in the demise of a language is that the speakers\nbegin to have collective doubts about the usefulness of language loyalty. Once they start\nregarding their own language as inferior to the majority language, people stop using it in all\nsituations. Kids pick up on the attitude and prefer the dominant language. In many cases,\n \n2\n\npeople don’t notice until they suddenly realize that their kids never speak the language,\neven at home. This is how Cornish and some dialects of Scottish Gaelic is still only rarely\nused for daily home life in Ireland, 80 years after the republic was founded with Irish as its\nfirst official language.\nH\nLinguists agree that ultimately, the answer to the problem of language extinction is\nmultilingualism. Even uneducated people can learn several languages, as long as they\nstart as children. Indeed, most people in the world speak more than one tongue, and in\nplaces such as Cameroon (279 languages), Papua New Guinea (823) and India (387) it is\ncommon to speak three of four distinct languages and a dialect or two as well. Most\nAmericans and Canadians, to the west of Quebec, have a gut reaction that anyone\nspeaking another language in front of them is committing an immoral act. You get the same\nreaction in Australia and Russia. It is no coincidence that these are the areas where\nlanguages are disappearing the fastest. The first step in saving dying languages is to\npersuade the world’s majorities to allow the minorities among them to speak with their own\nvoices.\n \n3",
