  "passage_text": "Reading Practice\n \nPreserving Britain’s cultural heritage: to restore a\nlegendary theatrical dress\nAn astonishingly intricate project is being undertaken to restore a legendary theatrical\ndress, Angela Wintle explains.\nOn December 28th, 1888, the curtain rose on a daring new stage revival of Shakespeare’s\nMacbeth at the Lyceum Theatre in London. Topping the bill, playing Lady Macbeth, a main\ncharacter in the play, was Ellen Terry. She was the greatest and most adored English\nactress of the age. But she didn't achieve this devotion through her acting ability alone, She\nknew the power of presentation and carefully cultivated her image. That first night was no\nexception. When she walked on stage for the famous banqueting scene, her appearance\ndrew a collective gasp from the audience.\nShe was dressed in the most extraordinary clothes ever to have graced a British stage: a\nlong, emerald and sea-green gown with tapering sleeves, surmounted by a velvet cloak,\nwhich glistened and sparkled eerily in the limelight. Yet this was no mere stage trickery.\nThe effect had been achieved using hundreds of wings from beetles. The gown - later\nnamed the ‘Beetlewing dress’ became one of the most iconic and celebrated costumes of\nthe age.\nTerry was every bit as remarkable as her costumes. At 31, she became a leading lady at\nthe Lyceum Theatre and for two decades, she set about bringing culture to the masses.\n \n \nThe productions she worked on were extravagant and daring. Shakespeare’s plays were\nstaged alongside blood-and-thunder melodramas and their texts were ruthlessly cut. Some\npeople were critical, but they missed the point. The innovations sold tickets and brought\nnew audiences to see masterpieces that they would never otherwise have seen.\nHowever, it was a painter who immortalised her. John Singer Sargent had been so struck\nby Terry's appearance at that first performance that he asked her to model for him, and his\nfamous portrait of 1889, now at the Tate Gallery in London, showed her with a glint in her\neye, holding a crown over her flame-red hair. But while the painting remains almost as\nfresh as the day it was painted, the years have not been so kind to the dress. Its delicate\nstructure, combined with the cumulative effects of time, has meant it is now in an extremely\nfragile condition. Thus, two years ago, a fundraising project was launched by Britain's\nNational Trust1 to pay for its conservation.\nIt turned to textile conservator Zenzie Tinker to do the job. Zenzie loves historical dress\nbecause of the link with the past. ’Working on costumes like the Beetlewing dress gives\nyou a real sense of the people who wore them; you can see the sweat stains and wear\nmarks. But it’s quite unusual to know who actually wore a garment. That’s the thing that\nmakes the Beetlewing project so special.’\nBefore any of Zenzie’s conservation work can begin, she and her team will conduct a\nthorough investigation to help determine what changes have been made to the dress and\nwhen. This will involve close examination of the dress for signs of damage and wear, and\nwill be aided by comparing it with John Singer Sargent's painting and contemporary\nphotographs. Then Zenzie and the National Trust will decide how far back to take the\nreconstruction, as some members feel that even the most recent changes are now part of\n \n1\n\n \nthe history of the dress.\nThe first stages in the actual restoration will involve delicate surface cleaning, using a small\nvacuum suction device. Once the level of reconstruction has been determined, the original\ncrocheted2 overdress will be stitched onto a dyed net support before repairs begin. It’s\ngoing to be extraordinarily difficult, because the original doth is quite stretchy, so we’ve\ndeliberately chosen net because that has a certain amount of flexibility in it too,' says\nZenzie. When the dress is displayed, none of our work will be noticeable, but we’ll retain all\nthe evidence on the reverse so that future experts will be able to see exactly what we've\ndone - and I'll produce a detailed report.’\nZenzie has estimated that the project, costing about £30,000, will require more than 700\nhours’ work. ‘It will be a huge undertaking and I don’t think the Trust has ever spent quite\nas much on a costume before,’ she says. ‘But this dress is unique. It's very unusual to see\nthis level of workmanship on a theatrical costume, and it must have looked spectacular on\nstage.’ If Terry was alive today, there’s no doubt she would be delighted. Unlike many other\nactresses, she valued her costumes because she kept and reused them time and time\nagain. 'I'd like to think she’d see our contribution as part of the ongoing history of the dress,’\nsays Zenzie.\n \n1 A conservation organisation whose work includes the funding of projects designed to\nprotect and preserve Britain's cultural heritage\n2 Produced using wool and a special needle with a hook at the end\nAdapted from Sussex Life magazine\n \n2",
