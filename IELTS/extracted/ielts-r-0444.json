  "passage_text": "Reading Practice\n \nThe Cacao: A Sweet history\nA Chapter 1\n \nMost people today think of chocolate as something sweet to eat or drink that can be easily\nfound in stores around the world. It might surprise you that chocolate was once highly\ntreasured. The tasty secret of the cacao (Kah Kow) tree was discovered 2,000 years ago in\nthe tropical rainforests of the Americas. The story of how chocolate grew from a local\nMesoamerican beverage into a global sweet encompasses many cultures and continents.\nB Chapter 2\nHistorians believe the Maya people of Central America first learned to farm cacao plants\naround two thousand years ago. The Maya took cacao trees from the rainforests and grew\nthem in their gardens. They cooked cacao seeds, the crushed them into a soft paste. They\nmixed the paste with water and flavorful spices to make an unsweetened chocolate drink.\nThe Maya poured the chocolate drink back and forth between two containers so that the\nliquid would have a layer of bubbles or foam.\n \nCacao and chocolate were an important part of Maya culture. There are often images of\ncacao plants on Maya buildings and art objects. Ruling families drank chocolate at special\nceremonies. And, even poorer members of society could enjoy the drink once in a while.\nHistorians believe that cacao seeds were also used in marriage ceremonies as a sign of\nthe union between a husband and a wife.\n \nThe Aztec culture in current-day Mexico also prized chocolate. But, cacao plants could not\ngrow in the area where the Aztecs lived. So, they traded to get cacao. They even used\ncacao seeds as a form of money to pay taxes. Chocolate also played a special role in both\nMaya and Aztec royal and religious events. Priests presented cacao seeds and offerings to\nthe gods and served chocolate drinks during sacred ceremonies. Only the very wealthy in\nAztec societies could afford to drink chocolate because cacao was so valuable. The Aztec\nruler Montezuma was believed to drink fifty cups of chocolate every day. Some experts\nbelieve the word for chocolate came from the Aztec word “xocolatl” which in the Nahuatl\nlanguage means “bitter water.” Others believe the word “chocolate” was created by\ncombining Mayan and Nahuatl words.\nC Chapter 3\nThe explorer Christopher Columbus brought cacao seeds to Spain after his trip to Central\nAmerica in 1502. But it was the Spanish explorer Hernando Cortes who understood that\nchocolate could be a valuable investment. In 1519, Cortes arrived in current-day Mexico.\nHe believed the chocolate drink would become popular with Spaniards. After the Spanish\nsoldiers defeated the Aztec empire, they were able to seize the supplies of cacao and send\nthem home. Spain later began planting cacao in its colonies in the Americans in order to\nsatisfy the large demand for chocolate. The wealthy people of Spain first enjoyed a\nsweetened version of chocolate drink. Later, the popularity of the drink spread throughout\n \n1\n\n \nEurope. The English, Dutch and French began to plant cacao trees in their own colonies.\nChocolate remained a drink that only wealthy people could afford to drink until the\neighteenth century. During the period known as the Industrial Revolution, new technologies\nhelped make chocolate less costly to produce.\nD Chapter 4\n \nFarmers grow cacao trees in many countries in Africa, Central and South America. The\ntrees grow in the shady areas of the rainforests near the Earth’s equator. But these trees\ncan be difficult to grow. They require an exact amount of water, warmth, soil and protection.\nAfter about five years, cacao trees start producing large fruits called pods, which grow near\nthe trunk of the tree. The seeds inside the pods are harvested to make chocolate. There\nare several kinds of cacao trees. Most of the world’s chocolate is made from the seed of\nthe forastero tree. But farmers can also grow criollo or trinitario cacao plants. Cacao trees\ngrown on farms are much more easily threatened by diseases and insects than wild trees.\nGrowing cacao is very hard work for farmers. They sell their harvest on a futures market.\nThis means that economic conditions beyond their control can affect the amount of money\nthey will earn. Today, chocolate industry officials, activists, and scientists are working with\nfarmers. They are trying to make sure that cacao can be grown in a way that is fair to the\ntimers and safe for the environment.\nE Chapter 5\nTo become chocolate, cacao seeds go through a long production process in a factory.\nWorkers must sort, clean and cook the seeds. Then they break off the covering of the\nseeds so that only the inside fruit, or nibs, remain. Workers crush the nibs into a soft\nsubstance called chocolate liquor. This gets separated into cocoa solids and fat called\ncocoa butter. Chocolate makers have their own special recipes in which they combine\nchocolate liquor with exact amounts of sugar, milk and cocoa fat. They finely crush this\n“crumb” mixture in order to make it smooth. The mixture then goes through two more\nprocesses before it is shaped into a mold form.\nChocolate making is big business. The market value of the yearly cacao crop around the\nworld is more than five billion dollars. Chocolate is especially popular in Europe and the\nUnited States. For example, in 2005, the United States bought 1.4 billion dollars worth of\ncocoa products. Each year, Americans eat an average of more than five kilograms of\nchocolate per person. Speciality shops that sell costly chocolates are also very popular.\nMany offer chocolate lovers the chance to taste chocolates grown in different areas of the\nworld.\n \n2",
