  "passage_text": "Reading Practice\n \n \n \n \nFishbourne Roman Palace\nFishbourne Roman Palace is in the village of Fishbourne in West Sussex, England. This\nlarge palace was built in the 1st century AD, around thirty years after the Roman conquest\nof Britain ,on the site of Roman army grain stores which had been established after the\ninvasion, in the reign of the Roman Emperor Claudius in 43 AD. The rectangular palace\nwas built around formal gardens, the northern half of which have been reconstructed.\nThere were extensive alterations in the 2nd and 3rd centuries AD, with many of the original\nblack and white mosaic floors being overlaid with more sophisticated coloured ones ,\nincluding a perfectly preserved mosaic of a dolphin in the north wing. More alterations were\nin progress when the palace burnt down in around 270AD,after which it was abandoned.\nLocal people had long believed that a Roman palace once existed in the area .However, it\nwas not until 1960 that the archaeologist Barry Cunliffe, of Oxford University, first\nsystematically excavated the site, after workmen had accidentally uncovered a wall while\nthey were laying a water main .The Roman villa excavated by Cunliffe's team was so grand\nthat it became known as Fishbourne Roman Palace ,and a museum was erected to\npreserve some of the remains .This is administered by the Sussex Archaeological Society.\nIn its day, the completed palace would have comprised four large wings with colonnaded\nfronts. The north and east wings consisted of suites of private rooms built around\ncourtyards, with a monumental entrance in the middle of the east wing. In the north-east\ncorner there was an assembly hall. The west wing contained state rooms, a large\nceremonial reception room, and a gallery. The south wing contained the owner’s private\napartments. The palace included as many as 50 mosaic floors, under-floor central heating\nand a bathhouse. In size, Fishbourne Palace would have been approximately equivalent to\nsome of the great Roman palaces of Italy, and was by far the largest known Roman\nresidence north of the European Alps, at about 500 feet (150m)square. A team of\nvolunteers and professional archaeologists are involved in an ongoing archaeological\nexcavation on the site of nearby, possibly military, buildings.\nThe first buildings to be erected on the site were constructed in the early part of the\nconquest in 43 AD. Later, two timber buildings were constructed, one with clay and mortar\nfloors and plaster walls, which appears to have been a house of some comfort. These\nbuildings were demolished in the 60s AD and replaced by a substantial stone house, which\nincluded colonnades, and a bath suite. It has been suggested that the palaces itself,\nincorporating the previous house in its south-east corner, was constructed around 73-75\nAD. However, Dr Miles Russell, of Bournemouth University, reinterpreted the ground plan\nand the collection of objects found and has suggested that, given the extremely close\nparallels with the imperial palace of Domitian in Rome, its construction may more plausibly\ndate to after 92 AD.\n \n \nWith regard to who lived in Fishbourne Palace, there are a number of theories; for example\n,one proposed by Professor Cunliffe is that ,in its early phase, the palace was the\nresidence of Tiberius\nClaudius Cogidubnus ,a local chieftain who supported the Romans ,and who may have\nbeen installed as king of a number of territories following the first stage of the conquest.\nCogidubnus is known from a reference to his loyalty in Agricola, a work by the Roman\nwriter Tacitus, and from an inscription commemorating a temple dedicated to the gods\n \n1\n\n \n \n \nNeptune and Minerva found in the nearby city of Chichester. Another theory is that it was\nbuilt for Sallustius Lucullus, a Roman governor of Britain of the late 1st century, who may\nhave been the son of the British prince Adminius. Two inscriptions recording the presence\nof Lucullus have been found in Chichester, and the redating by Miles Russell of the palace\nwas designed for Lucullus, then it may have only been in use for a few years, as the\nRoman historian Suetonius records that Lucullus was executed by the Emperor Domitian in\nor shortly after 93 AD.\n \n \n \nAdditional theories suggest that either Verica, a British king of the Roman Empire in the\nyears preceding the Claudian invasion, was owner of the palace, or Tiberius Claudius\nCatuarus , following the recent discovery of a gold ring belonging to him. The palace\noutlasted the original owner, whoever he was, and was extensively re-planned early in the\n2nd century AD, and subdivided into a series of lesser apartments. Further redevelopment\nwas begun in the late 3rd century AD, but these alterations were incomplete when the north\nwing was destroyed in a fire in around 270 AD. The damage was too great repair, and the\npalace was abandoned and later dismantled.\nA modern museum had been built by the Sussex Archaeological Society, incorporating\nmost of the visible remains , including one wing of the palace. The gardens have been re-\nplanted using authentic plants from the Roman period.\n \n2",
