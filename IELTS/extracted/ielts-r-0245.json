  "passage_text": "Reading Practice\n \nLAND OF THE RISING SUN\nA\nJapan has a significantly better record in terms of average mathematical attainment than\nEngland and Wales. Large sample international comparisons of pupils' attainments since\nthe 1960s have established that not only did Japanese pupils at age 13 have better scores\nof average attainment, but there was also a larger proportion of 'low' attainers in England,\nwhere, incidentally, the variation in attainment scores was much greater. The percentage of\nGross National Product spent on education is reasonably similar in the two countries, so\nhow is this higher and more consistent attainment in maths achieved?\nB\nLower secondary schools in Japan cover three school years, from the seventh grade (age\n13) to the ninth grade (age 15). Virtually all pupils at this stage attend state schools: only 3\nper cent are in the private sector. Schools are usually modem in design, set well back from\nthe road and spacious inside. Classrooms are large and pupils sit at single desks in rows.\nLessons last for a standardised 50 minutes and are always followed by a 10-minute break,\nwhich gives the pupils a chance to let off steam. Teachers begin with a formal address and\nmutual bowing, and then concentrate on whole-class teaching.\nClasses are large - usually about 40 - and are unstreamed. Pupils stay in the same class\nfor all lessons throughout the school and develop considerable class identity and loyalty.\nPupils attend the school in their own neighbourhood, which in theory removes ranking by\nschool. In practice in Tokyo, because of the relative concentration of schools, there is some\ncompetition to get into the 'better' school in a particular area.\nC\nTraditional ways of teaching form the basis of the lesson and the remarkably quiet classes\ntake their own notes of the points made and the examples demonstrated. Everyone has\ntheir own copy of the textbook supplied by the central education authority, Monbusho, as\npart of the concept of free compulsory education up to the age of 15. These textbooks are,\non the whole, small, presumably inexpensive to produce, but well set out and logically\ndeveloped. (One teacher was particularly keen to introduce colour and pictures into maths\ntextbooks: he felt this would make them more accessible to pupils brought up in a cartoon\nculture.) Besides approving textbooks, Monbusho also decides the highly centralised\nnational curriculum and how it is to be delivered.\nD\nLessons all follow the same pattern. At the beginning, the pupils put solutions to the\nhomework on the board, then the teachers comment, correct or elaborate as necessary.\nPupils mark their own homework: this is an important principle in Japanese schooling as it\nenables pupils to see where and why they made a mistake, so that these can be avoided in\nfuture. No one minds mistakes or ignorance as long as you are prepared to learn from\nthem.\nAfter the homework has been discussed, the teacher explains the topic of the lesson,\nslowly and with a lot of repetition and elaboration. Examples are demonstrated on the\n \n1\n\nboard; questions from the textbook are worked through first with the class, and then the\nclass is set questions from the textbook to do individually. Only rarely are supplementary\nworksheets distributed in a maths class. The impression is that the logical nature of the\ntextbooks and their comprehensive coverage of different types of examples, combined with\nthe relative homogeneity of the class, renders work sheets unnecessary. At this point,\nthe teacher would circulate and make sure that all the pupils were coping well.\nE\nIt is remarkable that large, mixed-ability classes could be kept together for maths\nthroughout all their compulsory schooling from 6 to 15. Teachers say that they give\nindividual help at the end of a lesson or after school, setting extra work if necessary. In\nobserved lessons, any strugglers would be assisted by the teacher or quietly seek help\nfrom their neighbour. Carefully fostered class identity makes pupils keen to help each other\n- anyway, it is in their interests since the class progresses together.\nThis scarcely seems adequate help to enable slow learners to keep up. However, the\nJapanese attitude towards education runs along the lines of 'if you work hard enough, you\ncan do almost anything'. Parents are kept closely informed of their children's progress and\nwill play a part in helping their children to keep up with class, sending them to 'Juku'\n(private evening tuition) if extra help is needed and encouraging them to work harder. It\nseems to work, at least for 95 per cent of the school population.\nF\nSo what are the major contributing factors in the success of maths teaching? Clearly,\nattitudes are important. Education is valued greatly in Japanese culture; maths is\nrecognised as an important compulsory subject throughout schooling; and the emphasis is\non hard work coupled with a focus on accuracy.\nOther relevant points relate to the supportive attitude of a class towards slower pupils, the\nlack of competition within a class, and the positive emphasis on learning for oneself and\nimproving one's own standard. And the view of repetitively boring lessons and learning the\nfacts by heart, which is sometimes quoted in relation to Japanese classes, may be unfair\nand unjustified.
