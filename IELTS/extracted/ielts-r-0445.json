  "passage_text": "Reading Practice\n \nThe Can – A Brief History Lesson\nA.   The story of the can begins in 1795 when Nicholas Appert, a Parisian, had an idea:\nwhy not pack food in bottles like wine? Fifteen years later, after researching and testing his\nidea, he published his theory: if food is sufficiently heated and sealed in an airtight\ncontainer, it will not spoil. In 1810 Peter Durand, an Englishman, wanted to surpass\nAppert’s invention, so he elected to try tin instead of glass. Like glass, tin could be sealed\nairtight but tin was not breakable and was much easier to handle. Durand himself did no\ncanning, but two other Englishmen, Bryan Donkin and John Hall, used Durand’s patent.\nAfter experimenting for more than a year, they set up a commercial canning factory and by\n1813 they were sending tins of food to British army and navy authorities for trial.\nB.   Perhaps the greatest encouragement to the newborn canning industry was the\nexplosion in the number of new colonial territories. As people and goods were being\ntransported to all parts of the world, the can industry itself was growing in new territories.\nEnglishmen who emigrated to America brought their newfound knowledge with them. One\nof these was Thomas Kensett, who might fairly be called the father of the can\nmanufacturing industry in the United States. In 1812 he set up a small plant on the New\nYork waterfront to can the first hermetically sealed products in the United States.\nC.   Just before the Civil War, a technical advance by canners enabled them to speed up\nproduction. Adding calcium chloride to the water in which cans were cooked raised the\nwater temperature, speeding up the canning process. Also for almost 100 years, tin cans\nwere made by artisans by hand. It was a laborious process, requiring considerable skill and\nmuscle. As the industrial revolution took hold in the United States, the demand for cans\nincreased and machines began to replace the artisans’ handiwork. A good artisan could\nmake only 10 cans a day. True production progress in can-making began in 1922, when\nAmerican engineers perfected the body-making process. New methods soon increased\nproduction of cans to as many as 250 a minute.\nD.   As early as 1940, can manufacturers began to explore the possibility of adapting cans\nto package carbonated soft drinks. The can had to be strengthened to accommodate\nhigher internal can pressures created by carbonation (especially during warm summer\nmonths), which meant increasing the thickness of the metal used in the can ends. Another\nconcern for the new beverage can was its shelf life. Even small amounts of dissolved tin or\niron from the can could impair the drinking quality of drinks. Also the food acids, including\ncarbonic, citric and phosphoric, in soft drinks presented a risk for the rapid corrosion of\nexposed tin and iron in the can. At this point the can was upgraded by improving the\norganic coatings used to line the inside. The can manufacturers then embarked on a\nprogram of material and cost savings by reducing both the amount of steel and the amount\nof coating used in can making. These efforts were in part inspired by a new competitor -\naluminum.\nE.   Beverage cans made from aluminum were first introduced in 1965. This was an\nexciting innovation for the packaging industry because the aluminum can was made with\n \n1\n\nonly two pieces - a body and an end. This made production easier. Some of the reasons for\nthe aluminum can’s acceptance were its ductility, its support of carbonation pressure, its\nlighter weight and the fact that aluminum does not rust. Both steel and aluminum cans used\nan easy-open end tab but the aluminum tab was much easier to make. Perhaps the most\ncritical element in the aluminum can’s market success was its recycling value. Aluminum\ncan recycling excelled economically in the competition with steel because of the\nefficiencies aluminum cans realized in making new cans from recycled materials compared\nwith 100 percent virgin aluminum. Steel did not realize similar economies in the recycling\nprocess.\nF.   Prior to 1970, can makers, customers and consumers alike were unaware of the impact\nthat the mining and manufacturing of steel or aluminum had on the environment. The\nconcept of natural resource preservation was not an issue of great importance and the low\ngrowth of population during these early years further de-emphasized concerns for resource\ndepletion. Both industries, however, came to realize the importance of reducing their\nimpact on the environment in the late 1960s and early 1970s as a new environmentally\nconscious generation emerged. Manufacturers began to recognize the economics of\nrecycling, namely lower manufacturing costs from using less material and less energy. By\nthe 1980s and 1990s, recycling had become a way of life. Aluminum can recycling has\nbecome a billion-dollar business and one of the world’s most successful environmental\nenterprises. Over the years, the aluminum can has come to be known as America’s most\nrecyclable package, with over 60 percent of cans being recycled annually.\nG.   Advances in can manufacturing technology have also brought us lighter aluminum\ncans. In 1972, one pound of aluminum yielded only 21.75 cans. Today, by using less\nmaterial to make each can, one pound of aluminum makes approximately 32 cans - a 47\npercent improvement. Just the lightening of can ends makes a huge difference. When you\nmultiply the savings by the 100 billion cans that are made each year, the weight and\nsavings are phenomenal - over 200 million pounds of aluminum!\n \n2\n\n \nQUESTIONS 1-6\nReading Passage has seven paragraphs A – G.\nFrom the list of headings below choose the most suitable headings for paragraphs B – G.\nWrite the appropriate number (i – xi) in boxes 1-6 on your answer sheet.\n \nNB       There are more headings than paragraphs, so you will not use them all.\n \nList of headings\ni        The Invention of the Aluminium Can\nii       Technological Breakthroughs\niii      Canning and the Beer Industry\niv      The Invention\nv       Canning and War\nvi      Further Manufacturing Advances\nvii     Problems with Spoiled Contents\nviii    Expansion of the Industry\nix      Today’s Uses for Canning\nx       Drinks Canning\nxi      Cans and The Environment\n \n \nExample             Answer\nParagraph A           iv\n \n1.....................
