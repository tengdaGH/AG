  "passage_text": "Reading Practice\n \nA little-known island community comes in from the cold\nBack in early 1961, few outside the corridors of dwindling British power had heard of the\narchipelago centred on the main island of Tristan da Cunha, from which the scattered\nislands that make up the group took their name.\nIt would take a dramatic volcanic eruption, and an emergency evacuation that would grab\nthe attention of the media, to bring attention to this mysterious outpost of the British\nEmpire. It seemed that the islands, no more than pin-pricks in the Southern Atlantic Ocean,\nalmost equidistant between Buenos Aires in South America and Cape Town in South\nAfrica, preferred not to be found.\nThe same can be said of the 290 or so residents of Tristan da Cunha at that time. They\nlived on the remotest island on the entire planet.There was no airport, nor was there space\nto build one on this mountainous carbuncle projecting from the ocean.The only harbour,\nimpenetrable during rough weather, was 1,500 miles distant from the nearest mainland\nport. Cape Town. Communications with the outside world relied predominantly on signals\nto passing fishing boats and the annual visit of the vessel that supplied the islanders with\nthe goods they could not produce themselves.\nFor this was a self-reliant community, proud of their ability to survive and help each other in\ntimes of adversity. Colonised early in the 19th century, until December 1942, money had\nnot been exchanged on the island. However, war-time conditions and new development, in\nparticular a new fishing industry, saw the beginnings of links which meant that the islanders\nhad to accept they were now part of the modern world, however much the older members\nof the community might resist such change.\nThe lives of the islanders ticked quietly along, largely ignored as the government of Britain\nstruggled with larger events on the world stage, until the beginning of August 1961. Earth\ntremors and rock falls began on the 6th, but by October the situation had got so bad that\nthe island had to be evacuated.The entire population eventually found themselves in\nEngland, where they were met with unwanted and unexpected attention from the media.\nThey were housed at a military camp just outside the port of Southampton.\nComing from a sub-tropical island and having had little exposure to the illnesses and chill\nendured by the natives of the British Isles during winter, several of the elder islanders\nsuccumbed. The government did not seem to know what to offer the islanders, there was\nno news about what was happening to their homeland, and the future looked very\nbleak.These were people who had built up their own way of life for over one hundred and\nfifty years. They were a compact community who shared only seven family names between\nthem, and now it seemed that their way of life was to be destroyed.\nFortunately, and despite the islanders reluctance to have any dealings with the media, who\nthey suspected looked on them as historical curiosities, the attention helped keep their\nplight in the public eye. Eventually, word came through that the island was again habitable\nand, despite strong resistance from the British Government, the vast majority of the\nislanders voted to return, turning their backs on the temptations of the brighter lights of their\ntemporary home in favour of their own.\nThe last of the returning islanders arrived in November 1963 and, with the rebuilding of the\n \n1\n\ncrawfish canning industry and a growing demand for the island’s stamps amongst\ndedicated collectors following the publicity caused hy the volcanic eniption, the local\neconomy soon recovered, although communications remained as difficult as they had ever\nbeen. Michael Parsons, a young British teacher who was employed on the island, recalls\nthat there was no television and mail from the outside world arrived just eight times a year.\n‘I was allowed to send a 100-word telegram home once a month,’he recalls,’and getting\nnews from home brought a lump to my throat’\nThings have changed with developments in technology, but at the beginning of the present\ncentury the island was again cut off from the rest of the world when, on May 23rd2001, a\nhurricane tore through the area. It caused extensive damage, knocking out the radio station\nand satellite telephone link as well as leaving the islanders without electricity. It would be a\nweek before news of the disaster reached London and several more weeks before a\nrescue package could be agreed to help the islanders rebuild.\nToday the island boasts its own internet café. For the first time people can see what the\nitems they wish to obtain from abroad actually look like before they purchase them – a big\nbonus in a place where you have to wait many months to receive an order which might\nprove to be unsuitable for the purpose you had in mind. At last, it seems, Tristan da Cunha\nhas joined the world.\n \n2",
