  "passage_text": "Reading Practice\n \nHunting Perfume in Madagascar\nA. Ever since the unguentari plied their trade in ancient Rome, perfumers have to keep\nabreast of changing fashions. These days they have several thousand ingredients to\nchoose from when creating new scents, but there is always demand for new combinations.\nThe bigger the “palette7 of smells, the better the perfumer’s chance of creating something\nfresh and appealing. Even with everyday products such as shampoo and soap, kitchen\ncleaners and washing powders, consumers are becoming increasingly fussy. And many of\ntoday’s fragrances have to survive tougher treatment than ever before, resisting the\ndestructive power of bleach or a high temperature wash cycle. Chemists can create new\nsmells from synthetic molecules, and a growing number of the odours on the perfumer’s\npalette are artificial. But nature has been in the business far longer.\n \nB. The island of Madagascar is an evolutionary hot spot; 85% of its plants are unique,\nmaking it an ideal source for novel fragrances. Last October, Quest International, a\ncompany that develops fragrances for everything from the most delicate perfumes to\ncleaning products, sent an expedition to Madagascar in pursuit of some of nature’s most\nnovel fragrances. With some simple technology, borrowed from the pollution monitoring\nindustry, and a fair amount of ingenuity, the perfume hunters bagged 20 promising new\naromas in the Madagascan rainforest. Each day the team set out from their “hotel”—a\nwooden hut lit by kerosene lamps, and trailed up and down paths and animal tracks,\nexploring the thick vegetation up to 10 meters on either side of the trail. Some smells came\nfrom obvious places, often big showy flowers within easy reach- Others were harder to pin\ndown. “Often it was the very small flowers that were much more interesting, says Clery.\nAfter the luxuriance of the rainforest, the little-known island of Nosy Hara was a stark, dry\nplace geologically and biologically very different from the mainland, “Apart from two\nbeaches, the rest of the Island Is impenetrable, except by hacking through the bush, says\nClery. One of the biggest prizes here was a sweet- smelling sap weeping from the gnarled\nbranches of some ancient shrubby trees in the parched Interior. So far no one has been\nable to identify the plant.\nC. With most flowers or fruits, the hunters used a technique originally designed to trap and\nidentify air pollutants. The technique itself is relatively simple. A glass bell jar or flask  S\nfitted over the flower. The fragrance molecules are trapped in this “headspace” and can be\nextracted by pumping the air out over a series of filters which absorb different types of\nvolatile molecules. Back home in the laboratory, the molecules are flushed out of the filters\nand injected into a gas chromatograph for analysis. If it Is Impossible to attach the\nheadspace gear, hunters fix an absorbent probe close to the source of the smell. The\nprobe looks something like a hypodermic syringe, except that the ‘needle’ is made of\nsilicone rubber which soaks up molecules from the air. After a few hours, the hunters\nretract the rubber needle and seal the tube, keeping the odour molecules inside until they\ncan.be injected into the gas chromatograph in the laboratory.\nD. Some of the most promising fragrances were those given, off by resins that oozed from\nthe bark of trees. Resins are the source of many traditional perfumes, including\nfrankincense and myrrh. The most exciting resin came from a Calophyllum tree, which\nproduces a strongly scented medicinal oil. The sap of this Calophyllum smelt rich and\naromatic, a little like church incense. But It also smelt of something the fragrance industry\n \n1\n\nhas learnt to live without castoreum a substance extracted from the musk glands of\nbeavers and once a key ingredient in many perfumes. The company does not use animal\nproducts any longer, but Ã was wonderful to find a tree with an animal smell.\nE. The group also set out from the island to capture the smell of coral reefs. Odors that\nconjure up sun kissed seas are highly sought after by the perfume industry. “From the\nocean, the only thing we have is seaweed, and that has a dark and heavy aroma. We hope\nto find something unique among the corals,” says Dir. The challenge for the hunters was to\nextract a smell from water rather than air. This was an opportunity to try Clery’s new\n“aquaspace” apparatus a set of filters that work underwater. On Nosy Hara, jars were fixed\nover knobs of coral about 2 meters down and water pumped out over the absorbent filters.\nSo what does coral smell like? “It’s a bit like lobster and crab,” says Clery. The team’s task\nnow is to recreate the best of then captured smells. First they must identify the molecules\nthat make up each fragrance. Some ingredients may be quite common chemicals. But\nsome may be completely novel, or they may be too complex or expensive to make in the\nlab. The challenge then is to conjure up the fragrances with more readily available\nmaterials. “We can avoid the need to import plants from the rainforest by creating the smell\nwith a different set of chemicals from those in the original material,” says Clery. “If we get it\nright, you can sniff the sample and it will transport you straight back to the moment you\nsmelt it in the rainforest.”\n \n2",
