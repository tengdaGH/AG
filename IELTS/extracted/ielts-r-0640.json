But of course far fewer of them apply for these positions. The study, \nconsultants NB Selection, shows that while one in six men who appear on interview shortlists g\nfigure rises to one in four for women.\nB The study concentrated on applications for management positions in the $45,000 to $110,000 s\nand found that women are more successful than men in both the private and public sectors Dr E\nMarx from London-based NB Selection described the findings as encouraging for women, in tha\npositive message to them to apply for interesting management positions. But she added, “We s\nsight of the fact that significantly fewer women apply for senior positions in comparison with me\nC Reasons for higher success rates among women are difficult to isolate. One explanation sugge\na woman candidate manages to get on a shortlist, then she has probably already proved herse\nexceptional candidate. Dr Marx said that when women apply for positions they tend to be better\ntheir male counterparts but are more selective and conservative in their job search. Women ten\nthoroughly before applying for positions or attending interviews. Men, on the other hand, seem \nability to sell themselves and to convince employers that any shortcomings they have will not pr\nfrom doing a good job.\nD Managerial and executive progress made by women is confirmed by the annual survey of board\ncarried out by Korn/Ferry/Carre/ Orban International. This year the survey shows a doubling of \nwomen serving as non-executive directors compared with the previous year. However, progress\npainfully slow and there were still only 18 posts filled by women out of a total of 354 nonexecuti\nsurveyed. Hilary Sears, a partner with Korn/Ferry, said, “Women have raised the level of grades\nemployed in but we have still not broken through barriers to the top.”\nE In Europe a recent feature of corporate life in the recession has been the delayering of manage\nstructures. Sears said that this has halted progress for women in as much as de-layering has ta\neither where women are working or in layers they aspire to. Sears also noted a positive trend fr\nrecession, which has been the growing number of women who have started up on their own.\nF  In business as a whole, there are a number of factors encouraging the prospect of greater equ\nworkforce. Demographic trends suggest that the number of women going into employment is st\nincreasing. In addition a far greater number of women are now passing through higher educatio\nthem better qualified to move into management positions.\nGOrganisations such as the European Women’s Management Development Network provide a r\nopportunities for women to enhance their skills and contacts. Through a series of both pan-Euro\nnational workshops and conferences the barriers to women in employment are being broken do\nAriane Berthoin Antal, director of the International Institute for Organisational Change of Archam\nsaid that there is only anecdotal evidence of changes in recruitment patterns. And she said, “It’s\nfor women to even get on to shortlists -there are so many hurdles and barriers.’ Antal agreed th\nbeen some positive signs but said “Until there is a belief among employers, until they value the \nnothing will change.”\n \n1",
