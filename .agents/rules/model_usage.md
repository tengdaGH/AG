description: "Model Usage Policy: Antigravity vs Gemini API"
---

All reasoning and content generation (Reading, Listening texts, Speaking/Writing prompts) **must** be done using Antigravity built-in models directly (i.e. generating text/JSON natively without external API calls).

The Gemini API (via `google-generativeai`) is **STRICTLY** reserved for voice/audio production tasks (e.g. TTS generation). Do not use the Gemini API for text generation.
